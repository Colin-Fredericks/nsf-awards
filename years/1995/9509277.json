Sixteen top science teacher-student pairs from high  schools statewide in Hawaii will participate in the workshop.  The  purpose of the workshop is to introduce students and teachers to areas  of planetary science that are pushing the limits of ground-based and  space-based astronomical technology.  There will be discussions of how  astronomers use the Mauna Kea telescopes and space-based facilities to  search for evidence of planet formation in other solar systems.  This,  (i) will create a new awareness of the forefront research of  astronomical science in Hawaii, (ii) will provide an exciting basis for  young students to consider careers in astronomy, and finally (iii) will  provide a wealth of new teaching materials to be used by science  educators at the high school level.  The workshop will involve  collaboration between many research scientists, telescope support  staff, and high school educators.  The format of the workshop is  arranged to allow discussions, demonstrations, hands-on activities, an  observatory tour, and night time observing opportunities for the  participants.  The teachers will be able to develop astronomy  activities, based on the workshop materials, for use in their classes  in the future.      This will be the third consecutive year of the program.  Educational  materials, for suggested astronomy classroom activities, will be  published and distributed to schools statewide after the end of the  grant period.",
