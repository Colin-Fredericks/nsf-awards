 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the synthesis and properties of   hydrocarbons and organometallic compounds whose carbon   frameworks can be identified on the buckministerfullerene   (C-60) surface. These polynuclear aromatic compounds with   curved surfaces possess bowl-shaped geometries and consist of   five- and six-membered rings. The interesting difference   between these compounds and the fullerenes is that, in addition   to having hydrogens, they have both convex and concave   surfaces. Thus, with organometallic derivatives one can study   the preferences for complexation on either the convex or the   concave side of the molecule, differential complexation at   either five- or six-membered rings, and numbers and types of   metals complexed, as well as a variety of other properties.  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting   the research of Dr. Peter W. Rabideau and his co-PI, Dr. George   G. Stanley, of the Department of Chemistry at Louisiana State   University Baton Rouge. Professors Rabideau and Stanley will   focus their work on the synthesis and properties of   hydrocarbons and organometallic derivatives whose carbon   frameworks can be identified on the buckministerfullerene   surface. These polynuclear aromatic compounds with curved   surfaces possess bowl-shaped geometries. The examples involving   30 carbons represent an exciting new family of hydrocarbons   whose structures represent one-half of buckministerfullerene,   and, as such, they are referred to as `buckybowls.`",
