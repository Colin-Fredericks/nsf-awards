She intends to study the Kodaira dimension of fiber  products of certain families of curves whose general member is of  general type. She will also study the geometry of the universal  Picard variety.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-  century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding  application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical  computer science, and roboticq.  ***",
