This research opens the possibility of producing  new polymers with tunable properties.  %%%  Curtis' research group has recently synthesized a new class  of conjugated polymers, the poly(alkylbithiazole)s, PABTs.  These new polymers have alkyl side chains that render them  soluble in common organic solvents, and thin films may be  cast from these solutions.  These new polymers are  regioregular and show unprecedented polymorphism with  attendant polychromism.  Thermal of solvent annealing of  the films induces solid state phase transformations that are  characterized by large increases in the conjugated length  and decreases in the band gap.  This research seeks to  determine the structures of the polymorphic phases and to  determine how the molecular structure of the polymer side  chains influences the solid-state packing, phase-  transformation energetics, crystallinity, conductivity, and  photo- or electroluminescence efficiency.  Model oligomers  will be synthesized and their 3-dimensional structures  determined by X-ray diffraction.  These model studies will  aid the interpretation of X-ray and EXAFS data on the high  MW polymers.  The polymers and model oligomers will be doped  with a variety of oxidants and the structures and  spectroscopic properties (UV-VIS, ESR, magnetic  susceptibility, etc.) of the doped systems will be  determined and compared with the neutral precursors. This  systematic study of  structure-property relationships will  provide new data for optimizing polymer structure for  specific properties, e.g. high conductivity, high  electroluminescence efficiency, thermal- or photo-stability,  etc.  The PABTs have a basic nitrogen functional group in  the chain backbone that can be alkylated or used to form  metal complexes.  These reactions alter the potential along   the chain.  Such changes may be used to alter conductivity  or to act as exciton traps to increase luminescence  efficiency and alter the wavelength of the emitted light.  ***",
