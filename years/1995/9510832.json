This program of fellowships is a joint  activity of the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the  Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences of  the National Science Fundation. Two-year fellowships are  offered each year in a effort to increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority groups,  i.e., Native Americans (including American Indians and  Alaskan Natives), Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Pacific  Islanders, thereby contributing to the future vitality of  the Nation's research enterprise.  The goal of the program  is to prepare minority scientists for positions of  scientific leadership in academia and industry.  The  fellowships are designed to permit Fellows to choose the  research and training environment most beneficial to their  scientific development.    The research and training plan supported by this fellowship  is entitled:  Identification of Mutations that Suppress mec-  4 (d)- induced Cell Death in C.elegans.",
