As a result, microbiological research at Yellowstone National Park (YNP) has expanded significantly.  Much of the earlier work at YNP was pioneered by Thomas Brock laying the foundations for microbiological research in the Park.  It is the organism isolated by Brock et al. From Mushroom Pool, Thermys aquaticus that is the original source of Taq polymerase enzyme in the polymerase chain reaction.  The usefulness of Taq polymerase has now focused interest on the biotechnological potential of thermophilic microorganisms, and on YNP thermal springs.  In addition, the many ecological studies, in particular those utilizing molecular phylogenetic techniques to assess microbial diversity, have identified a plethora of novel microbial and metabolic diversity.  As a result, park officials are faced with a new dimension of administrative policy: administering the microbial resources of YNP in a way that is both realistic and beneficial fo r the Park and the industrial and academic communities. Microbiological research at YNP has expanded significantly in recent years, and much has been published about microbiology at Yellowstone.  Yet, no synthesis of the research has been assembled.  This workshop addresses the following objectives: (1) recent advances in microbial ecological research, (2) biotechnological potential of microbial resources, and (3) park policies and initiatives for microbiological research at YNP thereby consolidating the interests of the National Park Service, the scientific community, and industry.  The workshop will result in a published document that will include contributions of the symposium. ***                         ;                                                      Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       9525964                             Shelley   S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   +                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A.
