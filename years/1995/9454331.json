The goals  of the project are to provide pedagogical and philosophical  foundations for improving science education, develop strategies  for increasing student learning of science, and develop a  significantly improved delivery system to encourage creativity,  problem solving, critical thinking, and communications.    The project has four activities.  The first is the Institute for  Science and Technology.  Through these summer institutes,  teachers take two years to get fully trained and integrate  technology into the curriculum.  The second is the internships  and mentorship program offered at places like the Indianapolis  Zoo and Lilly Research.  A third component is the \"Teacher in  Residence\" who is selected each year to work with the project.   Finally, there is a complementary preservice component with  Purdue University that is funded locally.    Fifty teachers are selected in the first year form Project  INSITE.  They receive 5 weeks of training over the two summers.   This includes formal training in science, work experience,  research experience, training on the Internet and  telecommunications, etc.  Several of these teachers will be  selected to help as trainers for subsequent groups each of eighty  teachers.  Participants are initially from Indiana.    Cost sharing is 30%.",
