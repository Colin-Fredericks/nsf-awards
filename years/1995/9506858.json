 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will consist of a keynote address providing a history of amyloid, and nine formal sessions of oral presentations, as well as poster sessions, whose topics will include protein and beta sheet structure, protein aggregation during folding in vitro, bacterial inclusion bodies, prion particles, and anti-trypsin  deposition, clinical summaries of major amyloid diseases, structural basis of amyloid formation by  peptides, basis for  sequence dependence of amyloid formation by peptides and globular proteins, the  amyloid pathway in Alzheimer s disease, physical methods for the study of insoluble protein complexes,  mechanisms of protein assembly, and factors associated with amyloid in vivo.    %%%   The primary goal of the FASEB Summer Research Conference is to bring together the cell biologists familiar with the biology of abnormal protein deposition with the molecular biologists and biophysicists who will ultimately establish an understanding of the molecular basis of these phenomena.. This new conference series will provide a forum to promote increased awareness of protein depositi on as a process that is not only biologically relevant, but also exhibits significant molecular structure and specificity. A  related goal is to stimulate interest among established and young investigators in doing research in  this area.",
