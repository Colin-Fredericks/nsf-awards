 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multimedia electronic books are now quite common. Electronic technical textbooks; however, are not practical or cost-effective to produce. What is lacking are the innovative software tools that will allow publishers to produce these products without an extensive software development investment. Electronic technical textbooks provide boundless potential to enhance the technical learning process and to stimulate wider interest in high-technology careers. Key to making electronic technical textbooks meet these promises is true dynamic interaction. Students must be able to not only visualize physical processes through animation, active equations, and graphing, but must be able to see the effect of changing parameter values on a physical process. It is only by this dynamic interaction that a true understanding of physical, electrical, and chemical processes are understood. Current multimedia technology does not provide this capability. Applied Research Associates proposes to build on their experience in developing electronic multimedia technical manuals and develop tools that will allow publishing houses to produce electronic textbooks at a cost that is easily recoverable. The unique aspects of the proposed software tools are that they: (1) provide linkage capability among active objects, a key requirement for technical texts; (2) provide dynamic interaction, a key requirement for bonafide improvement of the education process; and (3) minimize the need for programmers in the development phase, a key requirement for economic viability.",
