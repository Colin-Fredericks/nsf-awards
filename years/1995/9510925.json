It investigates the connection between the legal professions and the prospects for law and democracy in different settings.  Its central proposition is that the role if law in regulating the economy and governing the state depends on the structural position of the legal profession in the economy and the state and the social capital of prestige, social connections, background, and formal and informal connections legal professionals can mobilize on their own behalf.  It focuses on three types of countries that vary according to the historical position of their legal professions.  It uses, principally, data from elite interviews that focus on the individuals and institutions that serve to import and export particular legal practices related to trade and human rights.   %%%%  This project examines the connection between the internationalization of legal practice related to issues of trade and human rights, the transformation of the rule of law and role of the legal profession in newly developed and developing countries.
