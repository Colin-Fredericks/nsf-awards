The goal of MOVPE film growth studies is to identify the conditions necessary to obtain optimal concentrations of rare earth ions without dopant precipitation or degradation of materials quality or properties. Characterization studies will emphasize the relationship of the optical and electrical properties of the proposed systems to the growth process. Optical studies will include photoluminescence, electroluminescence, luminescence lifetime, luminescence excitation, absorption and near field scanning optical microscopy measurements. These studies seek to elucidate mechanisms of rare earth excitation and thermal quenching. High pressure studies will be conducted to study the effect of band structure on the luminescence properties of the proposed systems, and will also be used to determine the alignment of rare earth energy levels relative to the band edges of the proposed semiconductors. Systems found to be promising in electroluminescence studies will be fabricated into diode and waveguide structures and tested for their suitability in these applications. %%%  The primary goal of this program is to develop a fundamental understanding of the electronic and photonic properties and the epitaxial growth and processing of rare-earth doped semiconductor materials so that they can be exploited in the realization of a variety of advanced electronic and photonic devices. An important feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials and processing research.  This research will contribute to improving the general performance of advanced devices and integr ated circuits used in computing, information processing, and telecommunications.  ***",
