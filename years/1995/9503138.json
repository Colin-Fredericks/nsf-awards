In particular he will study real  algebraic morphisms and vector bundles on real algebraic varieties.  There will be particular emphasis on methods to explicitly  calculate invariants using techniques from intersection theory and  K-theory.    This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the  point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have  stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the  plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the  field uses methods not only from algebpa, but also from analysis  and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those  fields.  Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse  as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding  theory and robotics.",
