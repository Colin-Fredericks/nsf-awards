 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and his colleagues organize a  meeting to bring together research workers at the forefront of  activity in the broad area of scientific computing and  differential equations; special emphasis is given to the solution  of ordinary differential equations.  The motivation for  organizing a conference with this emphasis is to stimulate the  field by fostering links among researchers in numerical ordinary  differential equations and researchers in important areas of  application and researchers expert in the qualitative theory of  differential equations.  The injection of these theoretical  themes and application-oriented themes is designed to facilitate  significant advances in computational aspects of ordinary  differential equations.       Scientific computing is fundamental throughout science and  engineering, underpinning many of the important breakthroughs in  basic research and technological advancement that have been seen  in recent decades, and that will continue to arise in the future.  Differential equations form models of many important real-world  phenomena and scientific computing in this context is thus of  paramount importance.  This conference aims to bring together a  variety of research workers in the field, including experts in  application areas of scientific and engineering importance and  computational applied mathematicians expert in computer  simulations of differential equation models.  The outcome of such  a cross-fertilization of ideas will be beneficial to the  advancement of basic science and to the development of  technology.",
