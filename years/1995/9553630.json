 "awd_abstract_narration": "Buncick  9553630    The Physics Department and colleagues from the Department of Counseling, Educational  Psychology and Research of the College of Education, the Center for Research on Women, and  the University Honors Program propose a model program to improve learning and retention of  all students, but particularly women and minorities, in introductory physics courses.  Currently  many instructors are aware of the underrepresentation of women and try to encourage women  by increasing the visibility of women in science and providing them with role models.  The  purpose of this proposal is to move beyond these standard strategies and focus on removing  some of the  psychological barriers.  This effort focuses on calculus-based introductory physics  courses.  Students who attend these courses major in all areas of science and mathematics, but  are primarily engineering and physics majors.  Some straightforward pedagogical changes that  will address these barriers are to be implemented.  The proposed teaching techniques are  designed:  (1) to increase the comfort level in the classroom by establishing a sense of  community; (2) to build confidence in women and people of color; (3) to increase the perceived  value and utility of science and mathematics; (4) to reduce the competitive nature of the  classroom; (5) to develop self-assessment skills; and (6) to encourage risk taking to enhance the  learning process.  In addition, faculty are to engage in workshops and discussion sessions to  raise their awareness of the barriers that women and minorities face.  Faculty also are to be  involved in the development and refinement of pedagogical techniques that help to remove those  barriers.  The advantage of the structural and pedagogical approach, compared to other models  of comprehensive, often course-specific curricular reform, lies in:  (1) its portability from course  to course and from discipline to discipline, and (2) its emphasis on \"techniques\" rather than  content, thus making is likely to b e more easily and readily embraced by a broader range of  faculty.  A focus on pedagogical techniques and class structure is a unique aspect of this  program.    The intention is to use this project as a foundation for long-term pedagogical and faculty  development.  The program seeks:  (1) to reduce the overall dropout rate from the introductory  physics course through increasing the number of women and people of color who complete it,  through raising the grades of those completing it, especially the women and people of color,  through increasing satisfaction with the course; (2) to increase the proportion of women and  people of color who choose to continue in science, engineering, or mathematics; and (3) to  introduce to the science, mathematics and engineering faculty pedagogical techniques designed  to make classes more supportive, and to improve learning.  These efforts, hopefully, will lead  to a cooperative and mutually supportive network of faculty from engineering, science,  mathematics and education who share a commitment to increase the diversity of students who  take and succeed in science and mathematics courses at the University.  ***",
