 "awd_abstract_narration": "In software systems, tools such as compilers, testers, and  debuggers require static semantic information, both to  insure their correctness  and to enhance performance.  Incremental update algorithms, which only calculate  data  flow information affected by the program changes, avoiding  total  recalculation, efficiently provide consistent  documentation for a large  evolving software system.  Previously, incremental techniques for Fortran-like  languages and exhaustive analyses for C programs have been  developed. When  these analyses of C systems produce  solutions, they are inexpensive and high  quality; however,  often the analyses exhaust available resources without  yielding a complete solution, especially for larger  programs (over 5,000-10,000  lines of code). This research  aims at expanding the applicability of exhaustive  techniques to handle a wider class of programs and  developing incremental  techniques for C systems. The work  is performed by an academic and industrial team,  focusing on the development of new analysis  techniques and their testing on research industrial  applications.    Goals are to: (i) scale the existing  prototype to handle  programs with 10,000 to 100,000 lines of code, (ii) develop  techniques for analyzing modules without analyzing the  entire program (i.e., a  separate compilation mode of  analysis),(iii) develop incremental techniques for  interesting interprocedural static analyses for languages  with general purpose  pointers, and (iv) enhance the  theoretical infrastructure for semantic analysis  of modern  programming languages (i.e., C, C++, and Fortran 90).    The research  explores techniques for varying the precision  of alias information by designing  new, flow-insensitive  methods, to augment our current flow-sensitive ones.  Partitioning the program variables allows for an aliasing  solution with varying  degrees of precision for different  sets of variables.  Experiments are  conducted varying the  value of k for these different sets, using k-limiting to  handle dereferencing in recursive structures. A hybrid  incremental analysis  algorithm is used as a basis for  incrementalizing side effect analysis of C  programs.",
