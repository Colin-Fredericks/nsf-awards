 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417480  Li    This is a  three year cooperative research project  proposed  by Drs. Yuan -Hui Li and Christopher Measures, University of  Hawaii, and Professors T. M. Hsiung and Su-Cheng Pai,  Taiwan National University.   This proposal requests funds  to carry out oceanographic research to understand the  seasonal distribution patterns of the trace metals in the  East China Sea and Kuroshio-Current System.  This study is a  part of the international Joint Global Ocean Flux (JGOF)  Experiments.  The goal of this study is to improve the  understanding of the sources, sinks, and transport processes  of the trace elements in this region as well as their  contribution to the Western Pacific.   The investigators are  highly regarded for their analytical abilities for  oceanographic analysis and their contribution to ocean  research.   The proposed collaboration is mutually  beneficial.  The U.S. principal investigators will benefit  from the access and the ship and data support from the  Taiwan oceanographic surveys in a unique part of the Pacific  Ocean where little or no trace element data are available,  while Taiwan scientists will gain data on trace metal  distribution with which they can greatly improve the  understanding of the dynamics of regional seas.   This is an  excellent project, which addresses an important problem in  chemical oceanography.   This project is jointly supported  by the NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council (NSC),  which provides major support for ship and laboratory  operations in Taiwan.  The modest support from the NSF in  this case is extensively leveraged by the NSC.",
