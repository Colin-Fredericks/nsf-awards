 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of social processes in exchange networks.  It extends a program of theory-based investigations on power and social exchange into other fundamental sociological and social psychological processes: status, distributive justice, and legitimacy.  The foundation for this research, Network Exchange Theory has been tested chiefly within a specialized type of experimental exchange setting in which agents linked in networks negotiate over pools of resources under various conditions that govern transactions.  This new research will broaden the scope of Network Exchange Theory by developing and testing exchange settings more akin to those found in society.  To this end, the researchers will adapt their experimental paradigm to permit valued resources to enter the exchange system at different network locations, and to move through the network as exchanges transpire.  Agents in the network thus engage in true exchanges of one type of resource for another, rather than the simpler single-resource pool-divisions of previous experiments.  After calibrating the new setting and running tests with different network structures, the researchers will integrate the social processes.  Status, distributive justice, and legitimacy are all predicted to have specific, independent effects on resource distribution in exchange networks.  These occur through their influence on negotiation tactics and evaluations of exchange outcomes, and are modeled by the theory.      %%%     This set of experiments is fundamental scientific research on social capital, the capacity to gain resources that an individual may have on the basis of position in a social network and of socially-ascribed status.  Thus it is a contribution to the fundamental knowledge base concerning human capital, testing and developing formal models of how factors beyond individual skill and motivation may affect the incomes and careers of individuals.",
