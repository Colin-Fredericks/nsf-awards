Statewide assessments of student performance are critical to the improvement of American education.  Through such assessments, state governments can assess the comparative strengths and weaknesses of students' achievement and can guide school systems and schools in the remediation of deficiencies in curriculum and instruction.  Existing standard-setting methods were developed for use with multiple-choice, pencil-and-paper tests in which students select an answer from among those presented in each test item.  These methods are not directly applicable to modern performance assessments that attempt to measure what students can do, not which answer they can select.  As more and more states modernize their assessments in lie with newly-developed curriculum standards, such as those of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, they must e defe nsible and reliable methods for determining whether their students have achieved levels of performance that are competitive with those of the  world's major industrialized nations. The research proposed here will provide such methods.  The proposed research will be conducted by a consortium of directors of statewide assessments in five states and leading university-based psychometric researchers who have contributed substantially to the development of standard-setting methodology over the past two decades.  The research will be coordinated by the Council of chief State School Officers, ensuring its rapid dissemination to al of the nation's state departments of education and its ready adoption by those agencies.
