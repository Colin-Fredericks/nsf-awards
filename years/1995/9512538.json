 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding for a new high performance,  parallel computer for computational biology and chemistry,  specifically to study the structure and function of  biological macromolecules. Washington State University has  built considerable strengths in the studies of biological  macromolecules, of which both the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  (NMR) Center and the new X-Ray Crystallographic facilities  are important components. However, the key feature missing  is the lack of computing power. Computers provide the  crucial link since they are needed both for processing the  large data sets obtained from NMR and crystallographic  structure determination experiments as well as for  theoretical studies such as molecular dynamics simulations  and electronic structure calculations that provide the  connection between structure and function and that also  provide new directions for experiments.    Modern research in structural biology requires fast  computers, with ever increasing needs because of rapid  advances in experimental methods that require analysis of  larger and larger data sets and because of the increasing  importance of computer simulations in understanding  structure function relationships. In addition to daily  computational needs, each of the five principal  investigators has projects that require massive computing  capabilities. These projects include studies of myosin,  enzymesubstrate complexes, electron transfer complexes,  protein-nucleic acid complexes, and the role of water in  protein function.    Currently, computing for structural biology at WSU is being  carried on workstations owned by individual investigators.  Many of these workstations are more than 5 years old, which  means that they are at the limit of hardware reliability and  are orders of magnitude behind current workstations in  speed. For instance, computer simulations currently being  carried out take weeks of computer time on our fastest  workstations (IBM RS/6000 350). The only university  facilities are  an IBM 3090-300 and a VAX cluster (slower  than many personal computers), which are heavily overused  and expensive. Moreover, our most commonly used commercial  software is not available for these computers. Although new  inexpensive workstations (5 to 7 times faster than our  RS/6000) may be used for many simple problems, researchers  at WSU are facing more and more problems that require very  fast computation, huge amounts of memory and/or huge amounts  of disk space beyond the reach of individual investigators,  even those that use computers as a major research tool.  These needs can be met in part by Supercomputing Centers,  but these centers are becoming overloaded so a middle level  between that route and workstations is a vital need not  currently met on this campus.    Parallel processing computers such as the one proposed here  are an ideal solution for academic research. They can have  speeds equivalent to vector supercomputers such as Cray  computers, but at a fraction of the cost. These computers  have multiple processors of the same type that are found in  the fastest workstations, but the combination of these  processors into a single chassis provides several important  advantages over multiple independent workstations. First,  computation speed can increase almost linearly with the  number of processors by distributing the computational  \"load\" across several processors. Second, expensive  resources such as memory and software can be shared by  multiple users. Third, operations and maintenance of a  single machine are much less, leading to a great saving in  personnel time. Fourth, different processors may be  dedicated to different types of usage at different times,  allowing efficient usage of the processors. Finally, the  modular nature allows investigators to increase the  efficiency of the machine by simply adding additional  processors if money becomes available.    The proposed computer will replace our outdated workstations  in fulfilling routine computational needs, but  more  importantly, will allow investigators at WSU to pursue the  new avenues not possible on those workstations. Moreover, it  will have an impact on not only the researchers currently  directly involved in structural biology, but will provide a  means of introducing state-of-the-art computational methods  in structural biology and chemistry to researchers across  the campus. The computer will be accessible by any networked  personal computer or workstation, and staff are already in  place who would provide consultation. With the addition of  new faculty and the growing interest of existing faculty in  structure-function studies, it is crucial that a new  computer be obtained.",
