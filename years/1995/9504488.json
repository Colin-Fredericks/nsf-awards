 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Hill proposes to continue to develop the Bayesian theory of probability of B. de Finetti and L. J. Savage with respect to foundational issues that have important implications for applications of Bayesian inference and decision theory, and to continue the development of such applications as have been initiated by him.   These center about the Bayesian nonparametric procedures A(n) and H(n) of Hill (1968, 1988b, 1993a), and the tail-index estimator of Hill (1975).  For any epsilon > 0, it is proposed to constuct explicit exchangeable processes in a finite model, that satisfy the A(n) and H(n) assumptions exactly, apart from a set of observational values with probability at most epsilon.  It is also proposed to extend the Bayesian methods of forecasting of Hill (1993c, 1993d) using the theory of generalized urn processes of Hill, Lane, Sudderth (1980, 1987) and the splitting process models of Hill (1993a).
