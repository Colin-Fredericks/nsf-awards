 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550687  Wekezer  The proposed study will use DYNA3D, a nonlinear, explicit, three  dimensional finite element computer code for solid and structural  mechanics (Whirley, Hallquist, 1991).  The code was developed by  the Department of Energy and is being widely used by researchers  associated with the Department of Energy and is being widely used  by researchers associated with the Department of Energy, the  Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation, and most  of national laboratories and other research agencies.  DYNA3D is a  public domain computer code and is being provided by Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory to the FAMU/FSU College of  Engineering at no charge.  Finite element models of some vehicles,  roadside safety structures, as well as pavement properties and  their models will be provided by federal and state agencies as a  technology transfer effort.    Three small research groups consisting of one principal  investigator and one graduate student each will be formed and will  work on three research projects.  The research proposal asks for  funding to support all three research groups and for funding of one  computer work station to be shared by all investigators.    The proposed research activity is significant to the advancement of  knowledge in the area of transportation.  It will be beneficial to  federal and state transportation agencies and to transportation  related industries and it has a potential for securing future  research support.  ***",
