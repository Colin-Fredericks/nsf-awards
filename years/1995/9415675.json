Cartledge and  Dr. M.  Titlebaum, both of  Louisiana State University (LSU),  Louisiana, with Dr. P. Buchler, Univ. of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Drs. Cartledge, Titlebaum and Buchler are conducting  research on the solidification/stabilization of  hazardous  wastes using cementitious binders, a common technology  applied to waste streams, mostly of heavy metal containing  wastes.    The use of organoclays as additives in the process has the  potential for greatly expanding the utility of the method,  particularly for the treatment of mixed waste streams and  contaminated soils, where organic as well as inorganic  wastes are present.  The research groups at LSU and Sao  Paulo have unique and complementary capabilities.  The LSU  group is noted for experience with solid state nuclear  magnetic resonance spectroscopy, while the Sao Paulo group  has broad experience with real waste streams and  the design  of mixes that are effective for the immobilization of  organic containing wastes.  The proposed research will  involve sample preparation in Brazil, and the examination of  spectroscopic and other properties at LSU.  The LSU group  will benefit from the Brazilian groups' expertise in clay  uses and modifications, while the Sao Paulo group will  benefit from access to modern instrumentation for solid  characterization.    ***",
