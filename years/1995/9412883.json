 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary  Clegg, James S.  9412883  The Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) is a research unit of the  University of California (UC located on the Sonoma coast 80  miles north San Francisco.  Since 1966 the Laboratory has  provided unique opportunities for field research on a rich  floral and fauna in close proximity to the Laboratory  buildings.  BML has well-equipped laboratories, and  excellent seawater system, strong on-site support staff and  a firm commitment from the Davis campus to continue  developing the facilities and support needed by the growing  number of resident and visiting researchers.  The Laboratory  is located on the Bodega Marine Reserve (BMR), A 362-arce  protected field site with a diverse set of marine and  terrestrial coastal habitats.  Adjacent subtidal areas are  protected and available for study within the Bodega Marine  Life Refuge.    The Research programs of visiting scientists and graduate  students have been constrained in recent years by the lack  of adequate laboratory and office space.  Fortunately, a new  expansion building is under construction (UC funds) that  will rectify this problem.  However, the lack of adequate  housing for visitors is becoming an ever worsening problem  as requests for use of the site for research and instruction  continue to increase.  The project will provide support for  new housing unit that will remedy this situation, and  provide a suitable balance between Laboratory facilities and  the ability to accommodate the housing needs of visitors.",
