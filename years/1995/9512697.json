 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many  important analytical studies of biomolecules are not feasible  because  current technology is both too insensitive and at a scale  too  gross  for  experimentation with extremely small  sample  volumes.  The  overall  objective  of  this proposal is to explore  the  potential  of  micro-  and  nanometer scale technology to overcome these  limitations.  Two underlying principles motivate this work:           molecular  detection  capability  can  be  greatly  enhanced  in  micro/nanometer scale devices.       small  volumes,  from micro- to pico-liters or  less,  can  be  more   appropriately handled in small devices.       The  ultimate objective in these endeavors is to realize  integrated  instruments  that  permit in situ extraction and analysis  of  targeted  molecular components from an individual cell. In these initial efforts,  the  immediate goal is to study a specific class of molecules  involved  in   the   process  of  sea  urchin  embryogenesis  using  prototypical  microdevices  specifically  designed for this  research.  Transcription  factor   (TF)   proteins  regulate  differential  gene  expression   in  temporally  and spatially restricted regions of the embryo  by  binding  with high affinity to specific DNA sequences. With existing technology,  functional  TF/DNA binding studies can only be achieved using  hundreds  of  thousands  of embryos. To study TF/DNA binding from  small  regions  within  an embryo, or from individual cells, microdevices that  provide  the  following  functions will be sequentially constructed,  evaluated,  and optimized in this research pro~ram:          Manipulation and transport of cells, small tissue fragments,  and  solutions.          Lysis  of  cells/organelles to open their  contents  for  further  analysis.      Reagent mixing, to combine synthetic, fluorescent oligonucleotides and   unlabeled, non-specific DNA with cell extracts.       Electrical conductivity measurements/optical absorption spectroscopy   upon picoliter solutions.       Electrophoretic separation and detection of fluorescent molecules.       Many materials systems widely employed in contemporary nanostructure  research are chosen to optimize electronic or photonic properties,  but  these  are not necessarily ideally suited, nor perhaps even compatible,  with biological systems. An important thrust in this initial program is  the   development  of  materials/processing  combinations,   especially  highly-anisotropic dry etching procedures, which permit high resolution  microfabrication while retaining biological compatibility. Devices will  be  constructed  using both high resolution optical and  electron  beam  lithography,  dry  and  wet etching processes,  and  both  thermallyand  sputter-  deposited  thin  film  materials.  At  each  step  of   their  development,   the  instruments  created  will  be   applied   to   the  aforementioned  TF/DNA binding assays. This iterative  and  interactive  research,  carried  out on both nanofabrication and biological  fronts,  will  drive  the practical attainment of new classes of high resolution  instruments for biological science.       It  is anticipated that this work will spawn new research efforts at  the nanometer scale in both the science of biological phenomena and the  technology of bioinstrumentation.",
