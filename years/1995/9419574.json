 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of High Resolution X-ray Microscopy    A scanning soft x-ray microscope has been built and put into operation  at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National  Laboratory. The instrument makes use of the bright, tuneable undulator  source at the XlA beamline. It uses zone plates to form a 55 nm beam  spot, and is well suited to the study of wet, unstained specimens.    New imaging modes will be developed further to map particular chemical  states using the resonances present near elemental absorption edges  (XANES), and to use the detection of visible light excited in  luminescent tags for immunolabelling.    The instrument will be modified to accept frozen hydrated specimens.  This will minimize specimen damage due to radiolytical etching; such a  step is necessary to reach higher resolution in wet biological  specimens, and for studies where multiple images of hydrated specimens  are required, such as in tomography and chemical mapping. Whereas  electron microscopes can view thin cryosections at high resolution, our  instrument will be better suited to examining thick (1-10 ,m water  layer) whole specimens, without the need for sectioning.    The instrumental resolution will be improved to the 20-30 nm level  using higher resolution zone plates. With the planned brightness  upgrade of the Light Source, the microscope will remain the premier  instrument of its type through the proposed grant period.    These instrumentation developments will be undertaken to aid research  involving the following systems: chromosomes and chromosome folding,  malarial erythrocytes, the distribution of protein and DNA in sperms,  and spine formation in sea urchin embryo differentiation. These  collaborative biological investigations will be continued and expanded,  especially by the addition of a postdoc with biological rather than  x-ray physics background. The team also welcomes inquiries by  investigators interested in using the instrument to solve additional  biological problems mat ched to its unique capabilities.",
