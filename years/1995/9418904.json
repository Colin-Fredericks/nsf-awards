 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418904  Levy       Operational weather and climate predictions models of  the near future have three fundamental requirements:       1. Data management facilities that allow the  assimilation and manipulation of massive amounts of  heterogeneous and imprecise data obtained from a variety of  sources.       2. A modeling technology, both physical and  statistical, that allows the integration of partial and  heterogeneous data, accounting for the realistic non-linear  physics of the problem and the often complex error structure  encountered.       3. Efficient support of these functions within the data  assimilation cycle.       Responding effectively to these requirements calls for  an interdisciplinary approach.  A collaboration which will  bring together complementary expertise in the computational,  statistical, and the geosciences for cross training and  joint research is proposed.  The goal is to initiate cross  training which will enable the collaborators to address, as  a team, crucial problems in the atmospheric data  assimilation cycle.  The feasibility of applying  sophisticated theoretical solutions in practice by building  software tools will be tested.  By implementing an intensive  interdisciplinary plan that will include a colloquium  series, cross-teaching, workshops, and regular conferences,  the collaborators will broaden their understanding of the  complementary fields to be able to jointly propose and  develop a general methodology and a prototype for a specific  demonstration system.       In the demonstration system, a physical Boundary Layer  (BL) model will be used to integrate and manage massive  satellite sensed data.  The processing of such data  inevitably involves complex gridding, interpolation, data  quality control; and averaging, as well as the infusion of  arbitrary ancillary data sets and estimation of error  covariance structure.  Techniques to provide these functions  and apply them to the specific case of scatterometer (ERS-1)  stress data will be studied, a nd the feasibility of  synthesizing them from current disciplinary methods will be  explored.  The resulting data will be processed through a  Planetary Boundary Layer Model (PBLM) to link them to  atmospheric numerical prediction and general circulation  models.  Consequently, the system that will be proposed at  the end of the pilot project will make full use of BL  physics, heterogeneous error structure statistics, and high  quality data management to obtain better models.",
