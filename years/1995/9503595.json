 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503595  Khachaturyan    The objective of this project is to develop a set of  numerical methods which can be efficiently used in the  microstructure (and thus physical property) control of  multiphase advanced materials, with the potential use in  intelligent design and processing of materials with phase  transformations.  The theory and the corresponding  simulation models incorporating the transformation-induced  strain are expected to be advanced to a point where three-  dimensional numerical modeling is able to (i) realistically  characterize and predict the microstructure evolution during  the processing, (ii) test different models, and (iii) obtain  insight into the details of atomic mechanisms of structure  formation.  Emphasis will be placed on Ni-based superalloys,  zirconium oxide, and displacive transformations.  %%%  This project supports the continuing work of one of the  leading materials theorists in America.  The Principal  Investigator has adapted his analytic theory into  computational codes which model the development of  microstructure during phase transformations.  Materials  properties are closely related to the structure on the  micrometer scale, so it is desirous to understand how to  produce such microstructures so that materials can be  designed with properties of interest.  In this project the  Principal Investigator will extend his work from two-  dimensional modeling to three dimensions.  He will apply his  simulations to a variety of materials of importance which  can, in some circumstances, be compared with experimental  microstructures.  ***",
