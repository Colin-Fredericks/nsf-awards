 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414289  Schlenoff  Kinetics and isotherms of the adsorption of polyelectrolytes to  solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interfaces will be investigated.   Metal surfaces derivatized with surface-attached redox groups  will be employed to control the surface charge precisely in an  effort to relate polymer conformation and coverage to surface  charge density.  These \"smart\" redox-active surfaces will be used  to ascertain whether adsorption falls under thermodynamic or  kinetic control.  Radiolabelled hydrophilic/hydrophobic  copolymers, such as styrene sulfonate/butyl styrene, will be  synthesized and their adsorption at the interface between two  immiscible liquids will be studied.  For adsorbed  polyelectrolytes, the dependence of average coil radius on salt  concentration will be measured and compared with the well-known  dependence of solution polyelectrolyte dimensions on screening  length.  Diblock copolymers yielding brush-type morphologies will  be adsorbed at the solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interfaces and  their surface coverages at these two interfaces will be compared  and related to the mobility of the hydrophobic surface-anchoring  block.  Absorption of a polyelectrolyte into an oppositely-  charged gel will be measured to determine the extent and kinetics  of penetration of a charged macromolecule into a charged matrix  under conditions of zero applied electric field.    %%%  Adsorption of polyelectrolytes is the critical step in the  treatment of water for environmental purposes (drinking water,  municipal and industrial effluents, etc.).  This research will  provide important experiments that can be correlated with various  adsorption theories.",
