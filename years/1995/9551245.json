 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving the quality of instruction in computer  science by providing students with a powerful environment in which  to learn the basic principles of human-computer interaction (HCI)  when developing software.   It also allows them to experiment with  new techniques in developing the HCI component of a software  project.   With this lab, students are able to concentrate on the  user interface aspects of a project.   They gain experience with  modern user-interface software development tools as well as with a  wide variety of hardware input and output devices.   One additional  important component of this lab is the development of systems for  special populations, such as the physically handicapped.   This  laboratory project exposes students who wish to pursue careers in  industry to the skills that are in high demand.   In addition, it  prepares students who wish to go on to graduate school to engage in  advanced research projects.",
