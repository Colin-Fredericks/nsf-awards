 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501539  Lander  This  action is to support an international workshop to explore a  wide range of questions related to the collection, availability,  standards and the use of tsunami and other related data.    Recent tsunamis in Nicaragua, Japan, Indonesia, the Kurile  Islands and the Phillipines have been destructive and were  investigated by international teams of engineers and scientists.  The experiences from these efforts may be useful in designing  future field investigations.  Changes in instrumentation --  including remotely-accessible digital recording marigraphs (tide  gauges) and ocean bottom pressure gauges -- can cause problems,  as well as offer new opportunities.  Fear of a possible large  tsunami off the Washington-Oregon coast has generated a demand  for predicted runup data and inundation mapping.  Improved  computer modeling capabilities give the possibility of improving  the accuracy of runup predictions and of using models to generate  this information in real time, so as to generate customized  predictions for each community when a tsunami warning is issued.    Topics to be discussed include instrumentation, field  investigations and observations, ancillary data, current tsunami  data collection, and user needs.  The workshop is to be held in  Estes Park, Colorado, June 1995.  ***",
