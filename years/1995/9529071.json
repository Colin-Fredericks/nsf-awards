 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529071  Crain    The goal of this project is to develop a new and fairly simple  method for creating targeted point mutations in genes in mice.  Should the approach prove successful it would substantially  increase our ability to create precise modifications in targeted  genes in vivo. This would make it possible to carry out much more  sophisticated analyses of mammalian gene function and regulation,  and thus greatly enhance the study of mammalian genetics and  development. The experimental strategy is to promote homologous  recombination with targeted genes in embryos by injecting single  strand oligonucleotides (carrying the desired sequence change) into  pronuclei. The theoretical basis for this approach is that triple  stranded DNA structures appear to be required intermediates of  normal homologous recombination. The empirical basis is that it has  been shown that introduced single strand DNA and oligonucleotides  participate in homologous recombination in mammalian cells and  yeast, indicating that they probably are incorporated into the  putative triple strand intermediates. Also, it has been suggested  that single strand DNA is less likely to incorporate randomly into  host genomic DNA than is double strand DNA. If this is the case,  then the upper limit of the amount of DNA that can be introduced  without nonspecific toxicity to the embryos should be much higher  with single than with double strand molecules. The critical  question that will be tested in these experiments is whether a  sufficiently high number of single strand molecules can be injected  to raise the rate of homologous recombination with targeted genes  to a level that can be detected without genetic selection.  ***",
