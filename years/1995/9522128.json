 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Minority University Space Interdisciplinary Network, MU-SPIN, is a program for minority institutions, as well as colleges with significant minority enrollments, which is oriented around wide area  networking technology and its use in supporting interdisciplinary research.  Sponsorship is by the  NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Data and Computing Division, the University Programs Office, the  Equal Opportunity Office, and NASA Headquarters.  Based on the success of the 1991-1994 meetings, this project is to support the fifth meeting of the MU-SPIN User Working Group, October 4-7, 1995, at  Morgan State University, as well as a set of smaller workshops to be held during the year as a  supplement to the workshops are to provide opportunities for discussions on networking,  communications, and infrastructure building and for the exchange of ideas on networking and  communications to support interdisciplinary research.  Funding will support the cost of participant  travel, meals, and arrangements for the October meeting and expenses for the smaller workshops.  The  project is directly relat ed to the interests of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering  Directorate in that CISE is actively supporting programs to enhance the opportunities of  underrepresented populations in the computing field.  Access to adequate facilities, and the  interchange made available by the network connections is an important aspect of this effort, and the  programs of the large October meeting and those of the smaller workshops are expected to enhance the  opportunities of the participants.",
