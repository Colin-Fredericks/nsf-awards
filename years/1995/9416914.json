 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416914  Thomson    This award supports a two-year cooperative research project  between Dr. James Thomson of the State University of New  York at Stonybrook and Professor Izumi Washitani  of the  University of Tsukuba.  This project represents a  collaboration of a Japanese botanist and an American bee  ecologist to investigate the reproductive failure of a  native Japanese plant, the primrose Primula seiboldii.  This  plant experiences seed-set failure in an urban reserve north  of Tokyo and a variety of evidence suggests that this is  because native bumble bees have disappeared from the area.  The first, fundamental aspect of the this project is to  extend this evidence and then test the hypothesis rigorously  by temporarily bringing bumble bee colonies to the reserve.  The second, applied aspect involves re-establishing a self-  sustaining population of bumble bees and preparing a  management plan.    The proposal brings together research  scientists from two  countries working in the area of ecosystem studies and  conservation biology.  The U.S. scientist will have the  opportunity to become familiar with researchers and research  practices at the University of Tsukuba.  Therefore, this  proposal fuldills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an  international collaboration.  ***",
