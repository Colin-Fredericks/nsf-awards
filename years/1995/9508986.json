 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508986  Shores    Oxide scales that protect alloys during exposure to high  temperature oxidizing conditions invariably develop stresses  which can be large enough to cause the scale to fracture and  spall.  Scale origin, magnitude and evolution with time is not  well understood, yet mechanical damage to scales is often the  principal cause of failure.  In this work, scale and substrate  strains are measured as a function of time and temperature for  two nickel-base alloys.  This tests the hypothesis that stress  evolution during oxidation is a dynamic balance of stress  generation resulting from scale growth and stress relaxation from  creep of the metal substrate.  The research has several parts:  (a) obtain experimental stress history data to evaluate the  extent to which substrate creep or scale cracking is responsible  for stress relaxation; (b) develop a computer model to account  for the evolution of scale stresses in terms of materials  properties and scale growth mechanisms, considering especially  stress generation during isothermal oxidation and stress  relaxation by substrate creep; (c) input to the model  experimentally measured stresses and gradients in the scale  thickness direction; (d) characterize scale cracking at measured  stresses in terms of current theories.  %%%  This research project is important because of an understanding of  the origin of scale stresses.  Knowledge of their magnitudes and  evolution with time is necessary to characterize scale cracking  and spalling.  Such an understanding can provide a rational  design basis for improving the performance of scales on high  temperature alloys.  ***",
