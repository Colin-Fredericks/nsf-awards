 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503950  Vaughan    This award supports a three-month postdoctoral  fellowship for Dr. Brian Vaughan of the California  Institute of Technology.  This fellowship opportunity  will enable Dr. Vaughan to begin a collaborative  research effort with Dr. Fumiyoshi Makino of the  Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS.)  The investigators propose to perform spectral and  timing analyses of X-ray bursts using Japanese  satellites.  The proposed project provides a means to  \"unlock\" data collected from two Japanese satellites  and the three-month visit by Vaughan will help him to  establish a personal and professional link with a  leading researcher in Japan.    As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Vaughan will have the  opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and  equipment at ISAS while contributing to the overall research  effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of  the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
