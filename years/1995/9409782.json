This will be accomplished through a formulation of the equations of motion which is highly coupled with the node topology/internode communication architecture of the parallel computer system on which it will be run.  This work will be initially directed towards systems which allow for the use of explicit temporal numerical integration schemes.  Once accomplished, attention will be turned towards applying beneficial computational aspects of this work to applications which result in stiff systems of equations, and thus are confined to the use of implicit temporal integration procedures.   The effort will be to take advantage of aspects of O(N) and other low  order dynamic equations formulation procedures (e.g. use of recursive relationships to reduce operations), as well as descriptor formulations which are highly parallelizable. The intended result is the development of a multibody procedure/code which automatically produces equations of motion and associated simulation code for a specific complex multibody system which is the optimal ( in the sense of maximizing throughput) combination of low operations count and concurrent equations form for implementation on prescribed parallel computing system.  This will result in the maximum possible aggregate thoughput, and consequently, maximum overall speed for the simulation of the system on the available concurrent processing system. ***  u to advance the state of the art for the efficient modeling and simulation of the dynamic behavior of complex multibody systems.
