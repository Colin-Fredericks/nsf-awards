 "awd_abstract_narration": "Identifying and understanding the basis for interaction of  biologically significant molecules forms one of the cores of  modern biology.  Associative phenomena such as those between  cells, receptors and ligands, regulatory subunits and  catalytic subunits, inhibitors and activators with enzymes,  and individual components with  macromolecular complexes are  fundamental to cellular function.  Instrumentation to study  these interactions has constantly evolved.  Application is  made here to for the purchase of a BIAcore from Pharmacia  Biosensor, one of the newest generation instruments for the  interacting molecules.    The BIAcore uses surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to assess  changes in refractive index very close to a gold surface.  By coating the gold surface with a hydrophilic dextran  matrix, specific ligands can be immobilized on the sensor  chip using various alternative chemistries.  Binding of  biomolecules form solution in a flow cell to the ligand can  then be scored by SPR.  The BIAcore allows real time  analysis of the binding interaction, permitting the  derivation of both kinetic and thermodynamic constants and,  because the change in refractive index is directly  proportional to the change in absorbed mass, allows  determination of the stoichiometry of the interaction as  well.  Covalent coupling of the ligand to the sensor chip  allows convenient regeneration and, combined with the use of  a flow call, also allows the study of sequential binding  interactions.  The BIAcore is remarkably sensitive, usable  measurements can be made with as little as little as 50 l of  a 0.1 nM soluation of the molecule of interest.  The system  is fuly automated and computerized and therefore capable of  sustaining a high through-put.    The PI, four CO-PI's, and three major users will use the  BIAcore to analyze molecular interactions that are crucial  to cellular processes as diverse as DNA replication and  protein trafficking.  Studies are proposed to investigate:  i) the protein-protein int eraction between primase and DnaB  (the replication fork, ii) how various eukaryotic  replication fork components associate, iii) how type 1  topoisomerases bind to DNA, in) the protein-protein  interactions required for molecular chaperones of the heat-  shock protein families to assist in protein folding, v) the  protein-protein interactions required for proper recognition  during vesicular transport in the cell, vi) the effects of  ligand binding on homo and heterodimerzation of vitamin D3  and retinoid receptors, vii) the extent to which binding  affinities and specificites of cadherin extracellular  domains contribute to cadherin-dependent cell recognition,  and viii) the protein-protein interactions that are crucial  to TGF- signal transduction.",
