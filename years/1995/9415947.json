Dale  Oregon State University  Title: BEST: Benguela Current Sources and Transport, Current Meter  Data Analysis    The BEST (Benguela Current Sources and Transport) program was  designed to monitor the transport of the Benguela Current during  1992-1993 and relate its variability to regional phenomena, such as  the Agulhas Retroflection and eddy shedding.  The Project OCE-  9116922 was funded at Oregon State University for three years  starting August 1, 1991 to prepare, install and recover the current  meter moorings used as a part of the field work for BEST.  This  grant will continue that work and analyze those data to assist in  their integration into the much larger data set collected by BEST.   The scientific objectives and methodology were described in the  original proposal.    The data set consists of a June 1992 to November 1993 moored array  of Inverted Echo Sounders, Pressure/Inverted Echo Sounders, and  Current Meters; CTD data set along the line of mooring deployments  during June 1992, November 1993 and a more extensive set of  stations in May 1993.  The analysis will be carried out by A. L.  Gordon, LDEO, (specialty-water mass stratification; S.L. Garzoli  (specialty-IES/PIES), also at LDEO, after her assignment with NSF;  and Dale Pillsbury, OSU, (specialty-current meters).    This research is important because it seeks to provide new  knowledge about ocean currents and transports that would enhance  our ability to understand and model ocean circulations.",
