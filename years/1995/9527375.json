Over the past four years, extensive studies of downhole array  data from recorded earthquake motions at Lotung, Taiwan, and at  the Wildlife Refuge site, Imperial County, CA, have resulted in  the identification of a great deal of practically-oriented site  and soil dynamic response characteristics. The identification of  these characteristics is entirely based on the recorded downhole  acceleration data. Through these studies, a system of well  developed and integrated techniques has evolved for conducting  state-of-the-art analyses of downhole array data. In this  project, these techniques are used to analyze the recorded  downhole Hualien seismic records.  These records are used to  identify the site low-amplitude shear wave velocity profile, and  shear wave propagation; also the soil dynamic response  properties. The primary analysis tools used are optimization  routines combined with site amplification codes. Emphasis is  placed on the definition of practical analysis methodologies, and  design-oriented procedures.  ***",
