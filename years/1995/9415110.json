 "awd_abstract_narration": "Barnard College, founded in 1889, is an independent undergraduate college for women affiliated with Columbia University.  Its history is distinguished by the accomplishments of its students and by the quality of its undergraduates.  The College-s commitment to the sciences is substantial, which is reflected by the success of graduates who have pursue the doctorate degree. The Psychology Department, one of the prolific producers of women scientists, has an eminent tradition of faculty research and an impressive record of educating women scientists.  Many of the department-s achievements can be attributed to the strengths of the integrative neuroscience program.  Though successful, the program is in a  position of losing its momentum.  Present facilities in Milbank Hall, built in 1949,  severely limit the present, and threaten the future, research and research training programs in the area of cognition, perception, memory, learning and behavioral development.  Also home to the Environmental Science Department, a more recently established and rapidly expanding program, is experiencing dramatic growth despite outmoded facilities. Current laboratories prohibit faculty and students from conducting research on issues of climatic change and the geochemistry of water and air-born pollutants, central to faculty research.  ARI funds will be used to relocate and upgrade research labs for the integrative neuroscience program and for renovating existing research space occupied by  the Environmental  Department in Altschul and Milbank Halls.  Renovations will consist of:  increasing electrical power to sustain research needs, improving HVAC and plumbing systems, and installing two fume hoods.  With the renovations, Barnard will be in a position to maintain and advance the College-s strong research and research training record in Psychology; while enabling the Environmental Science Department to provide its faculty and students with the facilities required to achieve the distinguished record of the other sciences.  These improvements will allow Barnard to meet its long-term goals of providing the necessary resources for scientific research and of offering undergraduate women significant opportunities to conduct research.",
