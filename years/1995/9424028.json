The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. James Andrew Whitney to work with Professor  Thomas Erhard Kreis at the University of Geneva in  Switzerland.    One of the defining features of eukaryotic cells is the  system of membrane-enclosed organelles through which newly  synthesized secretory proteins pass on their way to the cell  surface.  The transfer of membrane and secretory proteins  between these organelles typically involves the formation of  distinct populations of transport vesicles.  Understanding  the molecular mechanisms of these transport events has  become one of the most important problems in molecular cell  biology.  The primary goal  of the work proposed here is to  learn more about the molecular mechanisms involved in the  selective budding of vesicles in the secretory pathway.  In  particular, the PI will use relatively new in vivo imaging  techniques to follow the dynamic distribution of cytosolic  proteins thought to play a role in this process. ***",
