 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded through the Faculty Early Career Development   (CAREER) Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Andrew Cooksy of the   Department of Chemistry of the University of Mississippi will investigate   and characterize  electronic states of a series of combustion related   hydrocarbon chain radicals for which the chemistry is likely to differ   substantially from the ground state.  The excitation energies of these   states, their structures as well as their electron distributions will be   determined spectroscopically.  The radicals C3H, C4H, HC4H2 and HC3O, as   well as the triplet states of H2C3 and H2C4 will be produced continuously   in a supersonic free jet by a modified version of pyrolysis sources.    Accompanying the research activity is a specified education effort   appropriate to the development of a full, balanced, academic career.   The study of the properties of combustion related free radicals is   important in that it provides data and models for the improvement of   combustion processes in internal combustion engines as well as in other   power sources.",
