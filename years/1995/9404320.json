The  aim of  the project  is to  refine and extend a variety of known theoretical results and  algorithms for scheduling problems, and develop techniques  for combining the procedures into one framework suitable for  implementation.   The resulting framework will then be  incorporated into an interactive, object-oriented system.  The research is based on problem decomposition; i.e.,  dividing the scheduling problem into a number of sub-  problems and then aggregating the results obtained into a  comprehensive global solution of the original problem.     The project will be a significant contribution to  scheduling education, as well as industrial practice.  During the last decade many industries have attempted to  develop, design and implement scheduling systems for their  operations, but have not always been successful because the  systems  were not sufficiently flexible, and not able to  adapt easily to changing objectives and constraints.  The  development of a tool to classify and successfully decompose  any scheduling problem will be of great benefit to users of  scheduling models.   The collaboration will profit from  the  complementary  strengths of both  scientists and  institutions.  Columbia University has an established record  in scheduling theory and applications, while Universidad  Catolica has extensive experience in the design and  development of scheduling systems.    ***",
