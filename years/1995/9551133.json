 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a need to train undergraduates in environmental  global-change issues that range from the microscale (e.g.,  pollutants in groundwater) to the macroscale (e.g., CO2 and  global climate change) within the context of natural Earth  processes.   At the heart of this training is laboratory  experiences, particularly those that involve field work.   This  project provides funds to develop and upgrade laboratories for  two fundamental courses in the Environmental Geosciences Program:  Environmental Geochemistry and Hydrogeology.   Environmental  Geochemistry addresses the origin, occurrence, distribution, and  flow of chemicals in the water cycle.   This is a relatively new  course offering at colleges and universities and one for which  there are few textbooks or laboratory exercises.   With these  funds, one of the first series of laboratory exercises in this  discipline is being developed.   Hydrogeology addresses the  origin, occurrence, distribution, and flow of water.   This  laboratory is being upgraded.   A unique and exciting feature of  this project is that these two laboratory courses are highly  integrated.   Integration is facilitated through the study around  a common theme -- the hydrologic, chemical, and physical dynamics  of a local watershed.   These laboratories give the student  hands-on experience in data collection, analysis, and  interpretation.   Students use equipment and technologies in  field and laboratory settings that will be useful to them in  graduate study or in industry.   After these labs have been  offered for a few semesters, students can study temporal changes  in the watershed by comparing their results to those from  previous years.",
