 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad objective of this CAREER project is to help cement the status  of software engineering as a discipline that uses models, methods, and  mechanisms based on generalizable scientific knowledge.  The research component of this project addresses three important  problems in software design. The mediator method is an approach to   design in which the behavioral relationships needed to integrate   independent behaviors are separately identified and represented   as objects external to the objects representing those behaviors.    Externalizing relationships as mediators depends in turn   on a careful application of both explicit and implicit invocation   mechanisms.   The first research focus is an attempt to improve scientific  foundations for software design, scientifically testing the claim  that common methods for designing integrated systems are poorer than  the mediator method with respect to ease of evolution of integration  requirements.  Second is the exploration, through pilot projects,   of using the mediator method to aid the design of distributed systems.      Third is the investigation of a new approach to helping  designers balance multiple objectives as software designs evolve. An   environment that reflects how well a design meets each of several   objectives by depicting divergences of  the design from each of several a models, where each model is defined  by the designer as good with respect to one particular objective.  The teaching focus is intended to develop engineers who understand  software design to be a multi-objective, risky activity, done with  incomplete information and thus demanding creativity and reflective,  rigorous, risk-reducing methods.  To help students understand how to  manage the complexity and risk of real software systems, courses  focus on realistic development projects, such as a mobile  robot system.",
