 "awd_abstract_narration": "Close    With an Archaeology Program \"High Risk Exploratory Grant\" Dr.  Angela Close will conduct a survey in the Southern Sinai Desert  of Egypt. She will seek to identify sites to solve two particular  problems. The first is the apparent hiatus in occupation of the  region between ca 30,000 and 14,500 years ago. This interval  spans the coldest part of the last glaciation. She will also  search for Neolithic sites which mark the origins of food  production in the region. Although previous work has discovered a  number of grinding stone which suggest that domestic grains were  available, no such plant remainq have actually been found.  Surveying will be conducted on foot and concentrated in three  zones. The most detailed work will be in foothills where springs  and vegetation would always have been attractive to human  occupation. Secondly, effort will also be focussed on the coastal  region because marine shells were collected and widely traded  during Neolithic times. Finally dry river valleys and lake beds  will be examined.    The Sinai peninsula is potentially of great archaeological  significance yet relatively little work has been done there. The  Near East is an area in which both plants and animals were  domesticated and a settled village way of life developed.  Archaeologists wish to gain insight into this process and the  work which Dr. Close will conduct has the potential to contribute  to this goal. The Sinai also provides the only land-bridge out of  Africa and has the potential to shed light on early human  migrations out of this continent.  This work is important because  it will, hopefully, establish the basis for a longer term  project.  ***",
