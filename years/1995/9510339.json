 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510339    Hoffman    The most extreme glaciations in Earth history occurred near the end of the  Proterozoic eon, when ice margins extended at sea level to within 10 degrees of  the equator.  The glaciogenic sediments in many regions are intimately  intercalated with typical warm-water carbonates, implying very abrupt climatic  oscillations.  Carbonates preceding the glacial deposits are extraordinarily   enriched in  13 C (13C>+6% PDB), signifying extreme rates of proportional organic  carbon burial, whereas those directly following the glacial deposits are high  depleted (  13C<-4% PDB).  This implicates a drawdown of atmospheric CO2 as the  cause of glaciation and a corollary increase in pO2 as enabling the initial  radiation of metazoans.  In contrast to the state of continental emergence that  presaged Cenozoic and late Paleozoic glacial epochs, stratigraphic and radiogenic  isotope evidence suggest that Neoproterozoic glaciations occurred in response to  continental inundation.  Accordingly, the Neoproterozoic glaciations may have had  more in common with the short-lived Ashgill (late Ordovician) glacial event.   These ancient occurrences illustrate the importance of considering the entire  geological record, which reveals events and processes not predicted by current  models nor expressed in the 1.4%  of Earth history represented by the Cenozoic.     Funding is requested to investigate two outstanding questions central to  Neoproterozoic global change:  (1) Do the glacial deposits represent globally  synchronous events of diachronous products or rapid continental drift?  (2) Do  the observed shifts in   13Ccarbonate reflect purely secular variations in ocean  surface waters or in part the spatial effects of differing water masses?  The  proposed study will be piggy-backed on ongoing field projects by the P.I. and by  Anthony R. Prave (City University of New York) on the sequence stratigraphy,  structural geology and regional tectonics of the Damara orogen in Namibia,  considered a keysto ne for the Neoproterozoic tectonic reorganization of  Gondwanaland.  The ongoing projects have identified volcanic horizons potentially  suitable for U-Pb zircon chronology within or bracketing three separate  glaciogenic formations.  Single-grain U-Pb zircon analyses will be done by  thermal ionization mass spectrometry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  under the direction of Samuel A. Bowring, whose recent chronostratigraphic work  has dramatically refined the early Cambrian time scale.  The ongoing projects  have already gone far towards establishing the sequence stratigraphic framework  and regional facies variations for carbonates above and below the glacial  deposits in northern Namibia.  Sampling and interpretation of carbon isotopic  variations will be grounded on this work and on follow-up diagentic studies.  The  isotopic and diagenetic studies will be undertaken by Alan J. Kaufman at Harvard  University, who has published extensively on Neoproterozoic isotopic  chemostratigraphy , including reconnaissance studies in Namibia.    Funding is requested to support the U-Pb and C isotopic analyses, and salary and  travel to the field for Kaufman.  The cost of field operations in Namibia and  support for other personnel will be borne elsewhere.",
