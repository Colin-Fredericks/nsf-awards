 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453106  Thorsen    This project is a collaboration between Georgia Tech, the Georgia Initiative in Mathematics and  Science (GIMS), Clark Atlanta University, Georgia Southern University, Georgia State  University, and the University of Georgia.  It focuses upon changing the structure of educational  programs which prepare mathematics and science teachers, which should lead to significant  changes in the ways girls are taught mathematics and science.  The goal is for quality  mathematics and science education to be equally accessible to both boys and girls in the state  of Georgia, i.e., that all students are encouraged to explore and discover mathematics and  science, are challenged, are successful in their explorations, and have opportunities to develop  awareness of career opportunities in these fields.  In order for access and equity to become  realities, permanent changes must be made in the structure of science, education, engineering  and mathematics departments.  These changes include incorporating the current understanding  of social, learning, and teaching factors which facilitate the interest, motivation, and achievement  of girls and women in science, engineering, and mathematics.  This goal is consistent with the  vision and goals of Georgia's Statewide Systemic Initiative, the Georgia Initiative in Mathematics  and Science (GIMS).  This project furthers and enhances the work of GIMS, and is structured  so that collaboration with GIMS is intrinsic.  The projects's specific objectives are:  (1) to  initiate and implement the redesign of teacher-preparation programs, including instruction in  science, engineering, and mathematics courses, so that they address issues that impact girls and  women; and (2) to provide professional development opportunities for faculty and  graduate/undergraduate teaching assistants of pre-service students emphasizing positive  interventions strategies on gender issues.    To achieve the goals, project strands have been developed.  These are:  (1) a framew ork for  institutional self-study (colleges/universities); (2) a tool kit of materials for teacher-preparation  courses; (3) professional development of faculty and teaching assistants; and (4) a prototype  teacher-preparation program.  Concurrent project-wide evaluation will occur on an ongoing basis  and will be used to assess and refine the strands.  To develop equitable learning environments  in science, engineering, education, and mathematics, and to create permanent changes, strategies  are being developed to address factors that have traditionally discouraged girls and women from  pursuing science, mathematics, and engineering.  As these strategies are tested by the  participating institutions, they are to be promulgated and incorporated throughout Georgia's  Statewide Systemic Initiative.  ***",
