 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manahan  9420803  Feeding larval forms of benthic marine invertebrates in the cold  waters of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica are present in the water column  for many months prior to the phytoplankton bloom.  It is currently  not understood how these feeding larvae of antarctic invertebrates  survive long periods under starvation conditions.  Knowing the  physiological mechanisms of this process is important for  understanding the ecology of larvae from antarctic regions.  Recent  findings with antarctic echinoderm larvae do not support the  suggestion that feeding larvae survive this period of negligible  phytoplankton abundance by using other food sources (bacteria or  dissolved organic material).  Physiological data, however, do  suggest a possible survival strategy whereby potential larval  lifespans can be extended for about one year in the complete  absence of food.  Such lifespans (without food) for feeding larval  forms are unique to antarctic larvae.  The metabolism of this  process in antarctic echinoderm larvae is the focus of this  research.  A hypothesis that the metabolic cost of development will  be lower in antarctic echinoderms than for the same \"unit of  differentiation\" (fertilized egg to feeding larval form) in  comparable temperate larvae will be tested.  Such data on temperate  larvae already exist and the proposed studies with antarctic larvae  will allow for a comparison of stage-specific developmental  metabolism.  To obtain these metabolic data, a novel technique  called coulometric respirometry that permits continuous  measurements of metabolic rate during development will be used.  In  addition, the biochemistry of development will be examined to  determine the mechanism(s) of low metabolism in antarctic larvae.   Data from experiments will test long-standing hypotheses about  cellular mechanisms of low metabolism as they apply to invertebrate  development in antarctic environments.  The findings from this  research may also have implications for larvae developing under lo w  food conditions in other cold environments, such as the deep sea.",
