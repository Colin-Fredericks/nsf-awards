 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. H.S. Gutowsky of the Chemistry Department of the   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will engage in a series of   continuing investigations on the structure and dynamics of weakly bound,   van der Waals and hydrogen bonded, molecular complexes.  The technique   employs a gas mixture cooled to near zero kelvins by a supersonic   expansion into a high vacuum and studied by pulsed Fourier transform   microwave spectroscopy.  Specifically, complexes containing benzene   dimers, complexes formed by rare gas atoms with hydrogen cyanide, and   those formed by argon with water will be investigated.  In addition,   ongoing work on alkali halide dimer complexes will be continued.    Weakly bound clusters are an intermediate form of matter that form when   gaseous molecules condense to form liquids or solids.  The structure and   dynamics of such clusters is of interest for obtaing an  understanding of   intermolecular forces on a molecular level,  for understanding of protein   folding, the orientation and mobility of  molecules on catalytic   surfaces, and other phenomena.  The research conducted by the PI provides   critical data and models for the bonding of molecules by weak   intermolecular forces.",
