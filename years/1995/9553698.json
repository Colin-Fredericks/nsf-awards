 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regional Technology Strategies, Inc. proposes to design,  support and implement, in partnership with the American Association  of Community Colleges, National Association of Manufacturers, and  the Southern Growth Policies Board, two major symposia, one in the  South and the other in the Northeast that will focus on how  two-year educational institutions can better meet the technical  skill needs of modern, high value, high performance manufacturers.   The proposed symposia are intended to inform education and training  policy makers about changes and opportunities in technical  occupations in advanced manufacturing, to deepen their  understanding of the emerging industrial modernization system, to  identify obstacles and opportunities to improve performance, and to  develop a clear vision of how to make those improvements.  Those  invited will include presidents of member colleges, chancellors of  state systems, and directors of state modernization programs,  school-to-work transition programs, and economic development  agencies.  Each chancellor will be asked to submit names of others,  e.g., presidents, legislators, board members, to be invited from  their respective states.       The host organizations in the South will be the Consortium for  Manufacturing Competitiveness, a group of leading technical  colleges started and incubated by the Governors and legislators of  the southern states under the Southern Growth Policies Board and,  in the Northeast, a new alliance of college systems.  The objective  of each is to accelerate and support industrial modernization with  improved technical education and services that build demand for and  help small and medium sized manufacturers better utilize technical  skills",
