The research will explore the interplay between  quantum confinement, electron-electron interactions and  transport in ultra-small electronic systems.  A deeper  understanding of these issues will lead to a better  appreciation of the limitations and opportunities available  in microstructure electronic devices.  In addition to  addressing fundamental issues of physics, the research is  important technologically, as the miniaturization of  electronic devices approaches the nanoscale level and  continues, perhaps, down to the molecular level.  The  specific objectives of the research will be (1) to  investigate the role of the Coulomb blockade for tunneling  through metal and semiconductor quantum dots in the regime  of strong coupling to leads; (2) to understand the effects  of disorder on interacting one-dimensional systems and edge  states in the quantum Hall effect; and (3) to study the  nature of electronic transport through molecules, which is  an issue of crucial importance to the emerging field of  molecular electronics as well as to the imaging of molecules  on surfaces using the scanning tunneling microscope.  %%%  Theoretical research will be conducted on the electronic  properties of very small systems in which the system size is  comparable to the scale of the electronic effects.  Besides  being of fundamental importance in physics, these studies  are crucial to understanding the limits and opportunities in  reducing the size of microelectronic devices.  ***",
