 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455618  Herman  Mathematics educators from three quite different institutions of  higher learning -Grinnell College, The University of Washington,  and Seattle Central Community College -- are jointly developing an  interactive linear algebra text. This text is being organized in  clusters of individual modules to facilitate its adaptation to many  different curricula. The main goals of the project are: 1) to help  students develop their geometric intuition about the concepts of  linear algebra; 2) to deepen their understanding of the algebraic  formulations of these concepts and strengthen their ability to  manipulate them; and 3) to help students gain an appreciation of  how the concepts and methods of linear algebra are applied. The  text is being constructed using Maple V, enhanced by a  supplementary package with superior text-handing and screen-layout  capabilities. The text is being designed to support collaborative  learning and writing to learn. Many exercises encourage  experimentation and exploration and many will ask for written  hypotheses and conclusions. The entire text will be made available  through the Mathematics Archives and hence will be readily  available to all by ftp, gopher, and MOSAIC. In addition to being  appropriate for all students majoring in scientific, engineering,  and mathematics, the textual materials are particularly appropriate  for use with students preparing for careers as secondary  mathematics teachers and are being tested with preservice teachers  at all three institutions.",
