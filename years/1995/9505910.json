In fresh water protozoa the organelle generally regarded to  be responsible for osmoregulation is the contractile vacuole  complex (CVC) which is thought to secrete a hypotonic  solution.  However, as cellular membranes are permeable to  water, how these or any cells can accumulate, store and  expel water or hypotonic solution uphill against a  concentration gradient of water remains a paradox.  This  project studies the poorly understood CVC organelle system  with electrophysiological, immunocytochemical and cell  biological methods.   The model organism selected is  Paramecium, a ciliate which offers the advantages (1) of  having recognizable and separate CVC compartments for fluid  uptake, fluid transport and fluid storage/expulsion and (2)  of allowing an easy assay for determining total cellular  fluid output.  The host laboratory has extensive experience  with this cell and its CVC, having studied in detail its CVC  ultrastructure. Monoclonal antibodies to different parts of  the CVC of this ciliate are available from preliminary work.  An understanding of how osmoregulation is achieved in  \"primitive\" single-celled eukaryotes will establish the  fundamental principles on which multicellular organisms may  have fashioned their own osmoregulatory systems as they  evolved.  (1)   Ion-selective microelectrodes are used to  determine the ionic contents of the in vivo CV fluid. (2)  The electrical potential, capacitance, and ionic conductance  of the CV membrane is measured and compared with the values  found for plasma membrane.  Membrane ion channels and  electrogenic pump activity are discriminated  electrophysiologically and pharmacologically, usine specific  ion channel and pump blockers.  Patch-clamping is used on  isolated CV membrane to determine the properties of  individual channels or pum ps.  (3) Confirmation that 15 nm  \"peg\" structures represent the V-type H+ ATPase is made  using monoclonal antibodies to specific polypeptides of the  pump. The tubules containing the pump are isolated and  characterized using the techniques of molecular biology. (4)  A fluid segregation mechanism is proposed.  The effects of  osmotic stress on the CVC is studied to see if these effects  are consistent with the mechanism.  The outcome of these  studies contribute to an understanding of the basic  mechanism of osmoregulation in this single-celled fresh-  water eukaryote as well as give a start on understanding CVC  regulation and provides a step in the eventual understanding  of the path of evolutionary development of osmoregulation in  higher animals.  %%%  Cells must maintain their content of salts and water at a  concentration which is favorable for life even though the  cells live in a harsh environment.  If these concentrations  waver from the norm, the cell will not be able to carry on  its metabolic functions and will die.  This project is an  exploration of how a single cell living in fresh water is  capable of secreting water to maintain the proper balance of  water and salts.  Protozoa have a contractile vacuole system  (CVC) which presumably does this job.  However, what is not  understood is how the water is accumulated within this CVC  since all membranes including those surrounding the CVC are  permeable to water.  One way around the paradox would be for  the cell to pump salts into the CVC to maintain a solution  within the CVC equal in salt concentration to the cell's  cytoplasm.  In this way water would enter the CVC and there  would be net backflow of water into the c cytoplasm.  Both  water and salts would then be secreted from the cell.  However, what salts the cell is capable of continually  excreting remains unknown.  Thus the investigation is  undertaken to determine what the contents of the CVC are in  the fresh water protozoan Paramecium, thereby determining  what the ce ll is excreting through its CVC.  (1) Ion-  selective microelectrodes are inserted into a living CVC to  measure the concentration of different ions. (2)  Microelectrodes are also used to determine the electrical  potential, resistance, and capacitance of the CVC membrane.  Clues about the types of ion channels and ion pumps driven  by the electrical potential across the membrane will be  followed-up with experiments using drugs which block  specific channels or pumps. The biochemistry of individual  ion carriers can be determined using by assaying the  electrical properties in an isolated patch of membrane  (patch clamping). (3) Using monoclonal antibodies against  pump components,  the identity of the pump can be verified  visually. (4) A probable mechanism of how the CVC works in  this protozoa is suggested and tested.  This study gives us  clues about how osmoregulation (the balance of salt and  water in cells) is made possible in nature and how this  process may have evolved from \"simpler\" forms of life to its  present state in higher organisms.",
