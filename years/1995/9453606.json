 "awd_abstract_narration": "Award Number: 9453606    Five colleges of the City University of New York (Brooklyn College,   College of Staten Island, City College, Hunter College and Lehman   College) together with New York University, are part of the  New York Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation; formed   to restructure the preparation of prospective teachers of grades K to   12. The Collaborative goal is to increase the number of college   graduates entering science and mathematics teaching at all academic   levels, and better equip them for teaching these subject areas to New   York's culturally, ethnically, economically and linguistically diverse   population. New links are being created: on the college campus,   between education and liberal arts faculties, and among the various   science and mathematics faculties; in each borough, between colleges   and school districts; in the university community, among various   colleges; and city-wide, between all participants and local   science-rich institutions and museums.     The Collaborative is engaged in six interrelated clusters of   activities, including: 1) developing new approaches to teaching and   assessing science and mathematics in college courses, so that   prospective teachers themselves experience learning in ways envisioned   by national reform efforts, and become familiar with exemplary   curriculum resources; 2) establishing a new program for middle  school teachers; 3) developing new training materials with special   emphasis on design of curriculum units which reflect collaboration   among faculty of varied disciplines and school teachers, and that   utilize the urban context; 4) providing student support and career   development, including follow-up of first year teachers and   internships in settings such as college tutoring centers, school   classrooms, and local science museums; 5) recruiting promising   students into teaching; and 6) developing exemplary field sites for   student teachers.",
