Constant  power operation is particularly important in the field of  electric traction which covers a wide range of applications  ranging from locomotives to electric vehicles.  At present, field  weakening techniques are used to widen the speed range of ac  machines of conventional design, but as the desired speed range  for constant power operation increases beyond twice the normal  (or \"rated\") speed, the motor size and weight increases  dramatically for both induction and permanent magnet type  machines.  In the proposed project, a comprehensive analytical,  simulation, design and experimental program is set forth to  develop ac induction and synchronous machines which possess the  capability of an extended \"constant power\" field weakening range  without need for an oversized machine.  Pole changing of the  stator winding of both types of machines is accomplished by  proper control of the currents fed to the phases of a specially  designed stator winding using only conventional pulse width  modulated inverters.  Hence, the stator pole changing mechanism  does not necessarily introduce any additional switches,  contractors or solid state (or passive) components to achieve its  task.  The goal of achieving extended field weakening range will  be accomplished by means of innovative concepts of stator and  rotor design which will enable these new machines to be roughly  30 to 50% the size and weight of conventional ac machines  presently used for this same purpose.  ***",
