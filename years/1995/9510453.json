 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510453  Luke  Muon  spin  relaxation  will be used to study  the  interplay  between various   interactions  and  phenomena  in  rare  earth  and  actinide compounds. Many of these  systems exhibit interesting magnetic behavior due  to  the  combination  of the Kondo effect,  Rudman-Kittel-Kasuya  Yosida  interaction and the effect of crystalline fields. In  materials where  these interactions are present, such  phenomena as heavy fermion superconductivity   and  quadrupole  Kondo   effect   are   observed.  Superconductivity and antiferromagnatic ordering coexist  in  uraniumplatinum-three   compound.  This  antiferromagnetism  contributes to multiple superconducting phases. This  research will help elucidate the microscopic nature of the  different superconducting states. In another compound,  cerium-copper2-silicon2, superconductivity and magnetism  do  not  coexist  but  compete  for  the  ground  state.  This  work  will investigate  the competition between the two  states.  The  competition between  Kondo screening and  exchange interactions will be studied  in cerium-copper-two-  tin-two. The relative importance of the  crystalline  electric  fields,  Kondo screening and exchange interactions  will  be determined   in  uranium  doped  yttrium-palladium-  three.  Theoretical models based on the anomalous low  temperature linear specific heat  in neodymium-cerium-copper-  oxygen compound will be tested by way  of  the measurement  of spin fluctuations in this compound.  %%%  Muon Spin Relaxation experiments will be conducted on a  number of rare earth  and  actinide compounds which exhibit  a rich interplay  between various  interactions  and  phenomena such  as  superconductivity  and magnetic  ordering. Five different studies will be conducted:  (1)  the coexistence  between  antiferromagnetic ordering and  the  microscopic nature  of  the  resulting multiple  superconducting  phases,  (2)  the competition  between  magnetic ordering  and  superconductivity  in  a compound  where they do  not coexist, (3) the competition between  Kondo screening  and  exchange  interaction,  (4)  the  relative  importance between  crystalline  electric fields,  Kondo  screening  and  exchange interactions,  and (5)  fluctuation effects in materials which  exhibit anomalous  thermodynamic behavior. Each of the  above  study  will  be  conducted on the appropriate compound.  ***",
