Because of the complexity of the overall membrane transport  process and its consequent resistance to classical biochemical  dissective analysis, the underlying molecular mechanisms that control  and catalyze the various membrane transport steps remain largely  unknown. This proposal describes a powerful method of genetic analysis  in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that isolates mutants defective  in the endocytosis of the yeast pheromone receptors. Surface pheromone  receptor is required for the mating of the two haploid cell types.  Under conditions where synthesis of new receptor is shut off, wild-type  cells mate poorly due to loss of surface receptor to ongoing receptor  endocytosis and degradation. Endocytosis-defective mutants retain  receptor at the cell surface, mate, and can thereby, be easily  isolated. Mutations isolated in the receptor genes themselves will  define the endocytosis signals on the receptor proteins themselves.  Mutations in other genes will define trans-acting functions required  for endocytosis, and serve thereby, to identify elements of the  transport apparatus. Preliminary results indicate that many of these  ren mutants (defective in receptor endocytosis) will be late-acting,  blocking endocytosis at post-surface transport steps. A pathway for  yeast endocytic transport will be defined through the genetic ordering  of ren mutants by epistasis analysis. Molecular cloning and sequence  analysis of the encoded proteins will impart a new understanding of the  molecules that catalyze endocytosis.  The mechanisms that drive the  fundamental processes of the eukaryotic cell -transcription, secretion,  and the cell cycle -- generally have been well conserved through  evolut ion from yeast to man. This appears to be true for endocytosis as  well. Molecules identified through this proposed research, we  anticipate, will allow isolation of the homologs that control  endocytosis in mammals.  %%%        Research in this proposal focuses a variety of powerful genetic  approaches on the process of receptor endocytosis, studied in the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Endocytosis is the process by which patches  of the cell surface membrane are invaginated and internalized into the  body of the cell. It provides a mechanism for uptake of essential  nutrients into the cell, and by controlling the abundance of different  receptors at the cell surface, it also serves to regulate the cell's  communication and contact with the external environment. Selective  internalization of surface receptors, both regulates the capacity for  response to different extracellular hormones and also modulates contact  with neighboring cells and beneficial symbionts. Not surprisingly,  endocytosis plays a major role in disease processes as well. A variety  of harmful agents -- viruses, bacterial endotoxins, and intracellular  parasites -- make malevolent use of this process.  Endocytic  trafficking entails uptake of receptors from the cell surface, and then  transport through a series of poorly characterized intracellular  compartments, the \"endosomes\". Because of the complexity of this  overall membrane transport process and its consequent resistance to  biochemical dissective analysis, the underlying molecular mechanisms  that control and catalyze the various membrane transport steps remain  largely unknown. Our newly developed genetic approach provides a  straightforward way of experimentally dissecting this complexity.  A  key first step will be the isolation of a collection of mutants that  block endocytosis of the yeast pheromone receptors. Cell surface  pheromone receptor is required for the conjugal mating of the two yeast  sexes. Under experimental conditions where new receptor synthesis  has  been shut-off, the yeast cells mate quite poorly due to the loss of  cell surface receptor to ongoing endocytic internalization. Mutants,  specifically defective for the endocytic process, fail to internalize  receptor, retain it at the surface, and consequently show robust  mating. Such mutants are easily isolated. Endocytosis-defective  mutations that map to the receptor genes themselves, will identify the  endocytosis signals, that is those features of the receptor proteins  which direct their own uptake. More exciting are mutations in other  genes. These will identify new proteins, elements presumably of the  molecular machinery that catalyzes and effects this endocytic uptake.  We expect that the subsequent molecular cloning and sequence analysis  of these novel proteins will impart a new understanding of the  molecules that catalyze this complex transport process.   The various  mechanisms that drive the fundamental processes of the eukaryotic cell,  generally have been found to be quite well conserved through evolution,  from yeast to man. Endocytosis is no exception, we anticipate therefore  that the molecules identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by  this research should provide an entry into the molecular analysis of  endocytosis in animal cells, allowing the isolation and  characterization of the analogous proteins from mammals.  ***",
