This initiative will help to design a  national undertaking to stimulate parent involvement in science and  mathematics education.  Anticipated outcomes include: a widely  published review paper that will summarize the research literature  and current parent involvement projects, and that will suggest  promising strategies to increase parent involvement in science and  mathematics education and; a major initiative, spearheaded by AAAS,  to develop parent involvement activities and programs that can be  linked to AAAS's community-based science projects and other  projects nationwide.",
