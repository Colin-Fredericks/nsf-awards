 "awd_abstract_narration": "The color patterns of butterfly wings are some of the most  spectacular examples of pattern formation in cellular  fields.  Little is known, however, about how these patterns  develop and evolve.  Recently, a molecular characterization  of butterfly wing pattern formation was initiated by cloning  butterfly homologs of numerous Drosophila appendage-  patterning genes.  The expression of these genes in  developing imaginal discs indicates that while the overall  organization of the developing butterfly wing is similar to  that of Drosophila, the suborganization of the butterfly  wing is marked by novel and dynamic patterns of regulatory  gene expression, some of which presage the future position  of adult wing pattern elements.  The project proposed here  aims to test three hypotheses emanating from this initial  characterization of the patterning landscape in butterfly  wings, including:  (1) eyespot formation is the product of a  genetic circuit involving proximodistal patterning genes;  (2) the secreted wingless, decapentaplegic and hedgehog  signaling proteins are involved in wing pattern formation;  and (3) the developmental prepattern may be conserved and  its interpretation by downstream genes is species-specific.  The experimental plan involves the cloning of several  additional proximodistal patterning genes, the analysis of  their spatial and temporal relationships throughout wing  formation, assessment of individual protein functions  through ectopic expression studies, and the comparative  analysis of developmental prepatterns in different butterfly  species.  The combination of descriptive, experimental, and  comparative work is aimed at identifying some of the  principal mechanisms guiding the development and evolution  of wing patterns.",
