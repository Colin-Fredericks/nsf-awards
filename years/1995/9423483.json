The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe      conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support   for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the   deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational   equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite      receivers to pin point the location of research sites,      communication equipment including radio transceivers and      satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data      communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats    for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.           The Project Director, William B. Hahn is fully qualified to   direct this project having had considerable experience in   overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard   equipment.         This project will allow the institution to obtain an upgrade  evaluation of the ship's trawl winch, to upgrade winch controllers  and the winch selection system, replace gyros, improve bridge wing  controls, upgrade the deck monitoring video system, replace two  outboard motors and two life rafts and obtain a portable computer  and a hose crimping tool.  ***",
