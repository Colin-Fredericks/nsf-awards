 "awd_abstract_narration": "The numerical solution of the large, sparse, symmetric   problem is required by many scientific and engineering   applications, such as  electronic structure calculations.  Iterative methods, the   only means of meeting  these demands, are faced with two challenges.  The first   involves degenerate or  pathologically close eigenvalues, and the second involves   matrices of very large  size that may not stored.  Parallel computing and   preconditioning are powerful  ways for improving the performance of iterative methods.    This proposal has  three major goals.  First, to extend the parallel   preconditioned eigenvalue methods that  are used in atomic structure calculations to the complex  molecular structure calculations in solid state physics.    Second, to extend the existing  eigenvalue codes to solve for large number of eigenvalues of  very large matrices.  Third, to explore further the   eigenvalue preconditioning,  with application to molecular structure matrices resulting   from finite  difference/element discretization techniques.    Preconditioning for large  matrices that cannot be stored are also being examined.    Finally, work on domain  decomposition preconditioners is continued on both the   application and on arbitrary matrices.  Domain partitioning   ideas is being tested  in combination with a coarse solve correction on a properly   chosen small system.  The aggregation/disaggregation technique is being   investigated for creating the small system.",
