 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501716  Collard    Demand for smaller, more versatile electronic and opto-electronic  devices  continues to grow in order to increase packing  density,  efficiency  and  operational speed. The search  for  smaller  and  smaller devices has now reached the final frontier, the molecular  scale.  Further reduction in device size must occur  at  a  level  which  addresses  ensembles of molecules,  or,  more  intriguing,  discrete molecules. Through the use of scanning probe microscopic  techniques   and   with  novel  molecular  building   blocks   of  pi-conjugated  polymers that have already  been  synthesized,  we  propose  to create defined, robust, and functional nanostructures  which will test the limits of ultraminiaturization. This approach  relies  on  the  modification of substrates  with  monolayers  of  monomers  that  serve  as templates for polymer  deposition.  The  research  program  will  provide  insight  into  approaches   for  integration  and nanofabrication of various electronic  materials  and  will  furnish  materials and methods  that  provide  precise  control  over  the  interfacial  behavior  of  composite  systems  relevant to the electronics industry.  %%%  In  the  long  term,  organic  nano-architectures  promise  great  flexibility in the design of microcircuitry elements and  quantum  wave  devices.  The key issues to be addressed in  this  research  include:  What  materials  can be used to  fabricate  micro-  and  nanostructures; how can nanoscale features be produced; what  are  the  limits of feature dimensions, and what are the stability and  properties of these features?    We are currently involved in a number of programs at Georgia Tech  and  in  the Atlanta area to increase the involvement of students  in technical education, including programs for minorities, women,  and   precollege  students.  Through  an  undergraduate  outreach  program   to  science  museums  we  are  developing  illustrative  interactive  chemistry exhibits, and a vibrant demonstrat ion  and  workshop  program.  Curriculum  development  activities   include  development of an advanced organic chemistry course based  almost  entirely  on problem solving, introduction of a polymer chemistry  course,   and   development   of   interdisciplinary   laboratory  experiments.  ***",
