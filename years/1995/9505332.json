In order to examine these  interactions and to relate fundamental studies to the concept of  global sustainability, an intensive summer study will be  undertaken in 1996 by the Pacific Basin Study Center of San  Francisco State University.  The study will bring together  international experts in the social and natural sciences as well  as policy makers from a number of nations.  It will focus on the  concept of sustainability, seeking to clarify the nature of  interactions among different systems, through an evaluation of  rice production.  In addition to examining social and economic  aspects of rice production, related natural systems like soils  and water will be studies.  This study will receive major support  from the Environmental Protection Agency.  This award provides  modest support from NSF to assist in planning efforts.       This study should provide new insights into the complex  dynamics of rice production in the Pacific Basin, thereby  advancing understanding of the ways through which environmental  and economic sustainability might simultaneously be pursued.  This project also provides a mechanism to enhance cooperation  between NSF and EPA in the joint pursuit of mutual goals.",
