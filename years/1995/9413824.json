 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413824  Rittmann  This is a grant to support research the objective of which is to  determine conditions under which monooxygenation reactions of  secondary substrates can be accelerated while achieving other  process goals in stable, suspended growth biological reactors  that are used to treat contaminated  wastewaters, leachates from  landfills and groundwaters contaminated by chlorinated aliphatic  and aromatic organic substances.  The specific substrates the  investigator plans on studying in this project are 4-chlorophenol  and 2,4 dinitrophenol.  A two stage process will be used in which  the first reactor will be used to enrich the cells with the  reduced electron-carrier and the second stage used to ensure  removal of substances capable of biochemically exerting a demand  for oxygen, to control growth of biomass and to provide adequate  retention time for the biologically active solids.      Aromatic hydrocarbons of petroleum origin, chlorinated aliphatic  solvents and the nitroaromatics are the most commonly detected  organic contaminants of water in the United States.  Biological  degradation of these compounds is an especially promising  approach because, if successful, degradation is complete and  likely to be economically viable under conditions that are not  extreme regarding the physical conditions under which degradation  takes place.  Results of this project are expected to improve the  design of biological reactors as they are used in environmental  engineering practice.    ***",
