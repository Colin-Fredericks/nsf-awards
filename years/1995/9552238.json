 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biology Department's undergraduate curriculum in physiology  is being enhanced by adding new or revised courses in human and  comparative vertebrate physiology to the current offering in  animal physiological ecology.   The courses are designed to have  a significant research component.   The university's goal is to  inculcate in students: (1) a fundamental understanding of  physiological processes, (2) an interest in scientific inquiry,  (3) an ability to formulate and test cogent hypotheses, and (4)  proficiency in the use of modern technology for acquisition and  analysis of physiological data.   An essential component of this  plan is to use student-friendly, research-grade instrumentation.    The computer-interfaced instruments funded through this project  permit students to examine several simultaneously changing  physiological functions in a much more dynamic and interactive  manner than is possible with older analog instruments.   The  BioPac physiological data acquisition system and Sable Systems  respirometry system have been chosen for their combined features  of ease for student use and superior research flexibility.    Multiple sets of instruments are obtained to enable us to  accommodate larger laboratory classes.   These instruments permit  class exercises and student research to be more extensive in  design and better replicated.   Students are finding the  investigative laboratories to be more informative and  enlightening than the \"standard\" labs of the past.",
