 "awd_abstract_narration": "9454815  Bryant    The Houston Independent School District (HISD) proposes a project  called Students and Teachers Achieving Results, or STAR.  The  program will focus on secondary teachers in HISD and the other  Urban Systemic Initiative school districts: Aldine, Alief, North  Forest, and Spring Branch.  STAR will provide training modules at  Focus Centers, as well as alternative staff development materials  developed by teachers to support the curriculum.  These centers  will offer a variety of training models based on the successful  practices used in the district and the collaborating university  centers.  The training models will stress the use of units using  demonstration, inquiry/discovery, experiment/laboratory, and  cooperative learning models.  STAR's intent is to design models  with assessment strategies incorporated into the activities.    HISD's goals of Project STAR are:         Goal 1       Combine the use of telecommunications with model classroom-       based science and mathematics professional development and       preservice teacher education.         Goal 2       Involve teachers in the continued development of appropriate       instructional and assessment models using resources available       on a district-wide network.    The objectives of the STAR project are to:              increase students' academic performance;            increase the quality of mathematics and science            pedagogy;             develop advanced telecommunications support and            information nationwide, and;            provide telecommunications information infrastructure            incorporating the widest variety of information            technolgies.",
