 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer workstations perform calculations and display graphics  fast enough to make real qualitative improvements in teaching  engineering.   This project is using 18 SUN SPARC 20 Model 61  Workstations to bring computer-aided design and scientific  simulation into our core courses.   Freshmen and sophomores in  all six engineering programs take a common core, lasting through  part of the third year, that gives a broad background in physics  and engineering science.   The new machines make possible three  things: first, students will have four years' exposure to a  uniform set of UNIX tools, allowing expertise to develop; second,  computer-aided design will begin in the earliest courses as a  better basis for later study; finally, engineers will develop  improved insight into the engineering sciences by simulation of  fundamental exemplary problems.   Traditionally, simple examples  that can be solved by hand are the main tool for teaching  introductory science.   Many suitable problems that could extend  one's physical intuition are neglected because they are hard to  compute or draw, a difficulty that workstations can overcome.    For example, one such problem in electricity and magnetism is the  electrostatic focusing of a beam of electrons in a CRT.   The  actual lens is just three concentric tubes set end to end at  different potentials.   Its analysis shows potential theory,  electric field visualization, and particle dynamics in an  economically important context.   This project is developing  software with simple interfaces for a suite of such examples as a  new teaching tool.",
