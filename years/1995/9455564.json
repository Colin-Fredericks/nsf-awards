 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455564  Fathe  A team of Occidental faculty members in physics and mathematics are  constructing a unified freshman program in physics and calculus. The  students in the program are those with some deficiencies in pre-college  mathematics and science preparation, but who might be motivated to pursue  a science or mathematics program as a background for a variety of  careers, including medicine, and K-12 teaching. These students are  disproportionally female, Latino, and African-American, groups which have  long been under-represented in mathematics and science-based careers.   The students enroll in a year-long course consisting of 4 units in the  fall semester and 8 units in the spring semester. The pace is relaxed to  permit students time to consolidate their mathematics skills and develop  physical intuition. In addition, the course includes appropriate use of  technology for analysis, simulation and calculation, carefully designed  group assignments and projects, and frequent writing assignments.  Further, the students are offered the opportunity to share a corridor in  a campus residence hall. Employment of upper division science students as  teaching assistants and residence hall staff helps to integrate college  learning with college life.  By the end of the program, the students will  have a solid understanding of how calculus and physics develop from a few  fundamental ideas, and how the disciplines are interrelated. They will  develop the mastery of basic math, physics, and communication skills  necessary to support these intellectual goals. More importantly, the  students will develop attitudes and learning styles that will support  further study and success in science and mathematics.",
