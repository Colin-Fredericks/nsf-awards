The new laboratories  will use the power of multimedia tools to build student  understanding of specific physics concepts while developing  students' abilities to properly apply these tools.         The lessons developed will have the following structure:  hands-on exploration of concept, microcomputer-based laboratory  (MBL) and visual-based laboratory (VBL) applications, and  assessment of student understanding.  The MBL activities will use  various probeware interfaced with a computer to acquire and display  data in real time.  The VBL activities will use video sequences,  prepared digital images, and simulation software to allow careful  measurements of phenomena or systems that would otherwise be too  difficult or too expensive to reproduce in the classroom.  During  the application activities, students will have spreadsheet and  symbolic-algebra software packages as well as an electronic physics  data base at their disposal to aid in their analysis and scientific  development.  An assessment activity will be completed at the end  of each laboratory period to evaluate student understanding of the  covered topics.  In addition, computers will be made available in  the Physics Learning Center where laboratory-related questions will  be integrated into the lecture courses.           This project will be evaluated by assessing student  performance and enrollment.  Furthermore, the materials and results  of this project will be published and made available for   distribution through The Learning Team, a non-profit educational  corporation in Armonk, NY.",
