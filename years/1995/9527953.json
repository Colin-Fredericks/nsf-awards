 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527953  Ling   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will investigate a new view of process equipment maintenance  and reliability as part of the life cycle modeling of manufactured products.  The path to accomplish this is to move maintenance of equipment and processes from responsive corrective repairs, to intelligent prevention using experience and scheduled service, finally to the goal of a science based and sensor enhanced way of doing predictive maintenance.  The focus area is the electronics industry, where these investigators have established the contacts needed to get empirical data to back up their theory and methodology.   The exploratory research objectives are: to judiciously assemble operating and maintenance data, to identify promising methods for  modeling equipment degradation that use both stochastic and mechanistic methods, and to include degradation modeling of process equipment in the life cycle modeling of manufactured products.   The models, backed up by data, will lead to a methodology that can identify equipment components that are critical because either they have precursors that give long range predictions of their degradation or they deteriorate so quickly they need sensor based monitoring.  This grant will attempt to establish a science and engineering base for maintenance, that will lead greater availability and productivity, lower  costs for energy and maintenance, and improved  product quality and safety.  ***",
