 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in computing and networking technology have opened a  new frontier in biological research. Baylor College of Medicine (BCM)  has recognized this opportunity and its potential impact on  understanding fundamental biological processes and developing  biotechnological applications. The field of computational and  structural biology was designated as one of the highest priority areas  for development and expansion at BCM in the 1994 report of the  College's Strategic Planning Committee.    This proposal will create a new core laboratory for high performance  computation, communication and visualization applied specifically to  biological research. The proposed facility will include a parallel  array of 12 processors with advanced visualization capability, and a  high bandwidth network to four research and teaching clusters  throughout the College. The core laboratory will be administered by an  executive director and an executive committee of seven faculty and a  student representative. It will be staffed with a computing application  specialist and a system administrator.    Twenty-five faculty members at BCM are key participants in this  proposal, which covers four research areas. These include electron  image reconstruction of macromolecular assemblies, x-ray  crystallography, molecular biology informatics and computational  neurobiology. All of the investigators are leaders in their respective  scientific disciplines and use computationally intensive methods in  their research efforts. Establishment of this proposed core laboratory  will provide highspeed network access to a high performance computing  and visualization resource that cannot be reasonably acquired by any  individual investigator. The impact of this proposed bio-computing core  laboratory at BCM will be enormous. This facility will:    x improve our ability to tackle problems of great importance in cell       biology, biochemistry, virology,    molecular genetics and neurobiology which rely heavily on       computa tionally intensive methods;  x facilitate the development of novel methods of analysis and simulation       using parallel and distributed    computation;  enhance our capability for visualization of large and       complex biological data;  x enable direct high-speed network linkage between the proposed high       performance computers and the    groups engaged in computationally intensive research at different       locations throughout the College;  x enrich student training in the use of computers for understanding       complex biophysical and structural    concepts;  x attract new faculty members and trainees at postdoctoral, predoctoral       and undergraduate levels to join    our recently established Ph.D. Program of Structural and       Computational Biology and Molecular    Biophysics (SCBMB).    The total cost of establishing the proposed core laboratory is $2.3  million, including equipment purchase, high-speed network connection,  room renovation, software installation, equipment maintenance and  personnel salary support for a period of three years. BCM will provide  34 % matching funds totaling $0.78 million. The total project cost that  NSF is asked to fund is $1.5 million.",
