 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Weitao Yang at the Chemistry Department of Duke University is   supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry   Program at NSF for studies of the electronic structure of large systems.   These studies involve the divide-and-conquer, D&C, approach which has   been pioneered by Professor Yang. The D&C approach to electronic   structure divides a large system into many smaller systems and the   electron density of each system is determined separately. The density and   properties of the entire system are obtained by appropriately combining   the results for the sub-systems. The D&C approach provides a powerful way   to use Density Functional Theory to determine the energies and other   properties of large systems, condensed matter as well as isolated   molecules. One focus of the work supported by this grant is to enhance   and extend the mathematical methods used in the D&C approach. In   particular, energy gradients are being calculated in order to allow the   efficient calculation of the stable geometries of these large systems.   There is also effort directed toward combining quantum mechanics and   molecular mechanics. The accurate quantum mechanical treatments are used   to describe regions of the system where there are important chemical   effects. On the other hand, the more approximate molecular mechanics   treatments are used to describe the environment of these regions. The   second focus of the work supported by this grant is to apply the D&C   approach to the study of the bulk and surface properties of solids. An   advantage of D&C  is that it can be used in a straightforward way to   treat systems without translational symmetry; thus, problems involved in   the adsorption, or chemisorption, of atoms and molecules on surfaces are   being treated.   A major limitation for accurate theoretical treatments of large molecular   systems has been the exponential increase in computational effort with   the size of the system being studied. A similar comment holds for the   size of the repeat unit, or unit cell, of solids. For a large system, it   is possible to relate the scaling of the computational effort to the   number of atoms, N, contained in the system. Ab initio methods scale at   the fourth or even higher powers of N and standard Density Functional   methods scale as the third power of N. However, the D&C approach to   Density Functional methods scales linearly with N; this linear scaling   could make accurate treatments possible for quite large systems. If the   efforts supported by this grant are successful, a major breakthrough will   have been made.",
