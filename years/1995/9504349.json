 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for research in computational logic.    The areas of  research stem directly from prior analysis of the structure   formulas in negation normal form.  That work raised many   questions and  led to explorations in several directions.  Substantial   results at the propositional level, preliminary experimental   at the first order level, and certain theoretical results   that the most important of these may be path dissolution, a   rule of  inference that is strongly complete at the ground level.    This project  continues exploration of this and related inference   mechanisms,  largely through experimentation.  One major thrust is to further the implementation of the  techniques developed earlier.  The current first order system  (``Dissolver'') is a solid platform on which the following   techniques   may be tested:  link selection; computing prime implicants;  backtracking; theory links and dissolution; and star chains.  While abstract proof-theoretic questions are of interest in   their own  right, enhancing the performance of Dissolver is an important  motivation for the theoretical work in this project.  The   investigations into multiple-valued logics largely fit the   category;  the study of the following issues  contributes to the development of Dissolver:  dissolution and  multiple-valued logics; dissolution, analytic tableaux, and   distributive law; quantifier duplication, proof length, and   cycles;  algorithms for computing prime implicants; and induction and   equality.",
