The first argues that worker ownership is feasible only in firms with very specific characteristics.  The second claims that while worker ownership is a viable proposition, the small number of firms exhibiting employee ownership results from the contexts in which the firms operate.  This research investigates the relative degree to which firm characteristics and changing local conditions account for the rise in employee ownership in the 1980s via employee stock ownership plans (EOSPs).  The study employs statistical modeling, to evaluate the interplay among firm characteristics and metropolitan-level conditions affecting the decision to implement EOSPs, and executive interviews to understand the role of business networks in th e spread of EOSPs. The project results will help better inform the theoretical debates concerning the relative importance of  firm characteristics versus contextual factors in the viability of  worker ownership and contribute to the discussion of the importance of changing labor relations in the American economy.",
