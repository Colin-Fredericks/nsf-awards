 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop, organized by Dr. James Momoh,  Professor of Electrical Engineering at Howard University, in cooperation with Dr. D. M. Kroko, President and Director-General of Energie Electrique de la Cote d'Ivoire, the national utility company, will  be held in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, in July 1996.  Researchers from Anglophone and Francophone Africa, (Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Senegal, Zambia, and South Africa), and across the US, working on electric power distribution, will identify technology issues and economical/technical benefits of effective distribution technology.  Little research has been done in Africa on distribution systems, whereas, in the US, research in these areas is becoming a priority.  This workshop will give the African participants first hand information on available tools and technology for efficient power system distribution.  It will help African engineers to solve the perennial distribution system problems in their countries; the resulting increase in reliability would bring  economic benefits.   The interchange will help US researchers and engineers understand the needs of the African countries and the methodologies they are using to solve the power system problems.  Previous workshops on related topics have stimulated a significant volume of follow-on collaborative activities among the US and African participants.",
