 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first-year funding of a three-year continuing  award.  The goal of this research is to study the execution of  complex visual-motor tasks by a robot using a manipulator under  visual control, based on an approach in which perceptual-motor-  inference sequences are generated by accessing a \"skill-base\" of  prior instances of perceptual-motor problem solving.  The ideas  will be tested by developing a \"visual\" robot that can build a  brick wall.  To execute complex tasks such as this, a robot must be  able to decide whether to execute a manipulator action such as  picking up a brick (in order to see it better, for example), a  perceptual action such as changing the viewpoint, or a  computational action such as inferring new visual features from the  image data.  The system will look where it looks and move things  the way it does based on what it did last time it was in a similar  situation.  The system will access a library of stored cases, each  describing a sequence of perceptual-motor actions, and will find  and adapt the cases whose process components are most similar to  the situation facing the system.  Interaction thus becomes recalled  process.  The system will demonstrate how useful robotic eye-hand  technology can be developed by exploiting perceptual-motor  knowledge stored as cases.  The approach should be widely  applicable to problems involving integrated action and perception.",
