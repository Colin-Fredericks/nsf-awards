 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the important role that earthquakes and seismology play in  the Earth sciences, there has been up until now no good way to  visualize the process by which an earthquake generates waves that  propagate throughout the Earth. These seismic waves are important  because they cause destruction in many parts of the world, are used  to determine the location and size of the earthquakes, and are the  means by which geologists have mapped out the interior of the  Earth. Without a way to visualize the process of seismic waves  spreading throughout the Earth after an earthquake, it has been  very hard to explain this phenomenon and for students to understand  it. The difficultly lies in the fact that the production of such an  animation requires advanced geophysical algorithms, high-speed  computational capabilities, and a strong dedication to use these  research capabilities for an educational purpose. This project  meets this need by producing a computer-graphics color animation  that accurately represents the propagation of seismic waves from an  earthquake, available to educators in both VHS-video and computer  formats.  The project is based on a prototype of such a  video-animation recently made by the PI.  The production of a  realistic visualization of earthquake wave propagation through the  Earth is computation ally intensive. The prototype took 5 months of  computation on a Sun Sparcstation 10/41.  The animation will not  only give viewers an intuitive feel for the internal structure and  layering of our planet, but also teach the principle of wave  physics applied to the Earth, showing waves reflecting, refracting,  and diffracting along the different layers within our planet. The  computer animation will be narrated, presenting an educational  discussion of earthquakes, their destructive capabilities, their  relation to plate tectonics, and their role in mapping the details  of the interior of the Earth.",
