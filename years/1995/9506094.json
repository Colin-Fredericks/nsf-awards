 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506094  Kropf    The  research described in this proposal will investigate the  cytoskeletal and ionic bases of polarity in zygotes of the brown  alga Pelvetia. The premise in this proposal is that the acquisition  of polarity is a highly regulated reorganization of the cell which  will be best understood by investigating relationships between key  regulatory processes. Dr. Kropf will study cytoskeletal control of  polarity, and then investigate the relationship between the  cytoskeleton and cytosolic regulatory ions. Preliminary evidence  indicates that cortical F-actin localizes in a patch soon after  fertilization, and expands into a ring that portends the future  rhizoid site. Dr. Kropf hypothesizes that sperm entry induces local  F-actin polymerization that then serves as a determinant of  polarity, specifically marking the future rhizoid site. This  hypothesis will be examined using cryofixation, confocal microscopy  and TEM. Prior to mitosis, the nucleus rotates 90 degrees bringing  centrosomes into an axial alignment. This nuclear rotation  determines the axial orientation of the spindle and transverse  alignment of the first division plane. Microtubules are thought to  be primarily responsible for nuclear rotation, and their dynamic  behavior during rotation will be investigated in real time by  injecting zygotes with fluorescently tagged tubulin. Centrosome  assembly and function will also be investigated. Finally the  hypothesis that the assembly and function of cytoskeletal elements  are regulated by local ion activities, specifically H+ and CA+2  activities, will be investigated.  ***",
