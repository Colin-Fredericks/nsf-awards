 "awd_abstract_narration": "The supercomputing industry is now dominated by parallel  architectures.  In many such systems, memory is physically  distributed among  processors in order to achieve better  scalability, requiring nodes to  communicate through a  network. In order to reduce communication latency, many  systems have the wormhole-routing switching strategy, in  which messages are  pipelined through  and a single  destination, or collective. Communication  operations may be  either point-to-point, which involves a single source and a  single destination, or collective, in which more than two  processes  participate.  Collective communication operations  are particularly important in  scientific computing, where  large data arrays are distributed over the local  memories of  the nodes, but are manipulated through single operations.    This  research project addresses the design of collective  communication operations  for wormhole-routed networks.  The  research is intended to explore  architectural and  algorithmic alternatives in the design of communications  subsystems for next generation wormhole-routed networks.    The project can be  divided approximately into four subareas.  First, both models will be used to  develop new algorithms  for collective operations in addition to those already  under  investigation.  Target platforms will include both direct  networks, as  well as wormhole-routed switch-based  interconnects. Second, the resulting  algorithms will be  applied in order to support higher-level parallel  programming constructs, such as virtual process topologies,  parallel I/O  operations and distributed shared memory.  Third, the resulting communication  services will be used to  improve the performance of parallel applications,  in particular parallel numerical algorithms.  Finally, the use of the new  models will be investigated in  wormhole-routed systems that  serve purposes other than parallel computing, such  as high  speed local area networks.  The methods used will be  analysis,  simulation, and experimental studies on commercial  wormhole-routed systems.  The significance of this research is that it will provide  new solutions to the  communication needs of parallel  applications.  Besides providing a better  understanding of  the issues and problems that must be addressed in design and  use of collective operations in wormhole-routing systems,  this project will  produce tangible results in the form of  new protocols, prototype  implementations of new algorithms,  and new applications software, all of which  will be made  publicly available for use by other researchers.",
