SGER: Fast Queries and Updates in Probabilistic Networks    Knowledge representation using networks is one of the most  promising approaches to Artificial Intelligence.  The main  goal of another current grant to the same investigator is to  develop very efficient algorithms for network-based AI tools  such as constraint networks and probabilistic networks,  focusing on utilizing parallel processing to achieve  execution time that is sub-linear in the size of the  network.  A by-product of this existing project recently was  several new compilation strategies for probabilistic  networks that allow, after fast preprocessing, the  processing of both queries and updates in time that is  logarithmic in the size of the database.  This represents an  exponential improvement in current algorithms.  At present,  the techniques are known to be applicable to certain special  cases, but it appears possible to extend them to more  general networks. If they can be extended  adequately, it  will have a strong impact on technology, given the wide  applicability of the ability to define, manipulate, and  update probabilistic information.  This small grant for  exploratory research is to explore the applicability of  these techniques, which were not a part of the existing  grant's research plan.",
