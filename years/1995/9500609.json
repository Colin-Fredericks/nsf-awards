 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research on certain generalizations of affine  Lie algebras.  The first of these is the quantized analogue of  the enveloping algebra of an affine Kac-Moody algebra, the  quantum affine algebra.  The finite dimensional representations  of this have very subtle behaviour, similar to the spherical  representations of a p-adic group, and the proposed approach is  to use techniques developed by Kazhdan and Lusztig in their study  of affine Hecke algebras.  The principal investigator intends to  construct the representations of these quantum affine algebras  and determine which admit perfect crystals, study their tensor  category structure, and investigate the relations with the  highest weight category.  The second theme of this project is to  define and study elliptic quantum groups.  The principal  investigator will study their more arithmetic behaviour, arising  from the moduli of elliptic curves.  It is expected that these  algebras will have serious implications for the study of the XYZ  Hamiltonian of statistical mechanics.    This research is concerned with a mathematical object called a  Lie algebra.  Lie algebras arise from another object called a Lie  group.  An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a sphere  where one rotation is followed by another.  Lie groups and Lie  algebras are important in areas involving analysis of sperical  motion.",
