 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9512113  Roberts, James L.        Classical chemical messengers in the central nervous system are  simple molecules which upon release are rapidly removed from the  site where their actions are exerted.  The brain and other bodily  tissues also use small protein molecules called peptides as  messenger molecules, but the mechanisms in place to terminate their  effects are relative unknown.  Dr. Roberts and Dr. Glucksman  identified a soluble peptide processing and degrading enzyme known  as EP 24.15 and established its potential role in modifying peptide  actions.  However, this enzyme has several unique features, notably  that it does not contain a sequence that will allow it to be  secreted by classical pathways, and it is located in the nucleus of  the cell as well as on the cell surface.  These unusual features  form the basis for the investigations to be performed by Drs.  Roberts and Glucksman.  They will examine the intercellular pathway  involved in the secretion of EP 24.15 and the mechanisms used by a  protein lacking a sequence involved in secretion, to be targeted  for secretion.  Multiple forms of this enzyme have been identified  and the relationship of these forms will be investigated.  These  exciting studies will reveal novel mechanisms involved in peptide  processing and secretion within neuroendocrine cells and have  implications for secretory biology, in general.",
