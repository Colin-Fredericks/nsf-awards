 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512564  El-Batanouny    This research will develop a versatile multi-technique/multi-  detection system to be used in conjunction with a newly  developed dual atomic beam (DAB) monochromator to be used for  surface studies. The instrument will be capable of measuring  the magnetic and spin-dependent electronic structure of solid  surfaces, as well as the related dynamical properties. The DAB  monochromator can generate a mono-energetic beam of either  ground-state helium atoms or spin-polarized metastable helium  atoms. The heart of the detection system is a miniaturized  angle-resolved hybrid detector which can provide dispersive  atom-velocity analysis as well as detection of metastable  atoms. Magnetic measurements to be performed involve  determining the long-range order of surface electron spin  polarization and the dynamical properties of surface spin waves  (magnons). The dual atomic beam mode of operation permits to  distinguish between surface magnons and surface phonons, as the  spin-polarized atom beam couples to both surface magnons and  phonons while the ground state atom beam couples only to  surface phonons. The technique is suitable for the study of  materials with highly correlated electron systems, such as high  temperature cuprate superconductors and other transition metal  compounds.  %%%  The implementation of this novel and unique system will open a  new area of research involving the properties of surface  electron-spin states and their dynamics, which remains  inaccessible to existing techniques. The proposed system is  simple, innovative, and user-friendly enough that it is  expected to have a wider use, with the potential for commercial  production.  ***",
