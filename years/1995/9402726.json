 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402726  GOODMAN       The goal of the Engineering Research Center in \"Neuromorphic  Systems Engineering\" is to develop the technology infrastructure  for endowing the machines of the next century with the senses of  vision, touch, and olfaction which mimic or improve upon human  sensory systems.  The Center will raise artificial neural network  technology to became an \"enabling technology\" for industry  (comparable with the impact of the introduction of the  microprocessor).  Although the U.S. is the world leader in neural  network research, a quantum leap in technology is needed for this  research to manifest itself as innovative processes and products in  U.S. industry.        The Center will aim to facilitate this leap by focusing on  sensory processing in which the natural parallelism of artificial  neural networks, and neuromorphic VLSI and optical circuits can  provide solutions to problems that are hard for conventional  computing.  These problems include vision, audition, tactition, and  chemical sensing (olfaction).  Coupling high bandwidth arrays of  sensors and actuators with the processing power and learning  abilities of distributed neural networks will generate a quantum  leap in human-machine interaction and machine-environment  interaction.       The Center will take a multi-disciplinary approach through the  tight coupling of sensors and intelligence required to achieve  sensory processing.  Algorithms and VLSI hardware must be developed  together.  Lessons must be learned from neurophysiology, anatomy,  and psychophysics but then translated into rigorous engineering  design and practice.  In order to have massive impact on industry,  these design technologies must be automated to the level that  digital Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are today.             The educational mission of the center will be assisted by  Caltech's existing Computation and Neural Systems (CNS) Ph.D  program.  Established in 1986, the goal of this multidisciplinary  program is to stud y the structure and computational powers of both  living and synthetic neuronal circuits and systems.  The program  currently has 34 doctoral students working in the laboratories of  20 Caltech faculty members, spread across the divisions of  Engineering and Applied Science, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics,  and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.         The Center will run an effective program for industrial  collaboration and technology transfer, as well as an outreach  program to academia, schools and local business.  Industrial  guidance will be obtained through the creation of an industrial  advisory board.       Ultimately, low cost hardware solutions to these sensory  processing tasks will open up new areas of application in industry  and ensure U.S. competitiveness in such areas as automatic  inspection, quality control, flexible manufacturing,  telecommunications, process control, transportation, consumer  electronics, autonomous machines, smart sensors, and robotics.       This award begins the ERC with an initial cooperative of  agreement of five years.  ***",
