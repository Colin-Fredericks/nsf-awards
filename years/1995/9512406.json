 "awd_abstract_narration": "This application proposes to acquire the necessary instrumentation for  developing a Shared DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of  Oklahoma Health Science Center. This instrumentation will include an  automated DNA sequenator with attendant computers and software for  collecting DNA sequence data, an optical disk drive for archiving  sequence data, a Sun workstation and an additional Macintosh computer  for DNA sequence analysis, and a spectrophotometer for analysis of  template DNA and primer concentration and purity for sequencing  reactions. Currently, we have state-of-the-art facilities that support  cell biology, genetics and most other aspects of molecular biological  research. However, rapid automated DNA sequencing is not currently  available on the Oklahoma City campus. Automated DNA sequencing can be  performed in the laboratory of Dr. Bruce Roe, in the Department of  Chemistry on the University of Oklahoma/Norman campus (roughly a 30  minute automobile drive). However, this facility is heavily used by the  laboratories of Dr. Roe and his collaborators, precluding routine use  of that instrumentation for the projects proposed in this application.    The research projects in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology  that will immediately benefit from this facility include: i) three  projects to examine structure/function relationships in eucaryotic and  procaryotic proteins (Lloyd, Gilmore and Tweten), ii) a project that  will examine the evolutionary development of MHC loci in minority  populations (Hildebrand), iii) a project that will examine the  evolutionary relationships among poxviruses (Palumbo), iv) a project  examining procaryotic plasmid/chromosomal interactions (Gilmore), and  v) two projects that will sequence the genomes of a gram-positive and a  gram-negative coccus (Dyer and Ferretti). Some of these projects are  currently supported by extramural funding, and the availability of this  Shared DNA Sequencing Facility will dramatically increase the  likelihood o f extramural funding for other projects. Intertwined with  and an essential component of this scientific enterprise is significant  training in basic molecular biology. This training includes the ongoing  research education of post-doctoral fellows and graduate students  within the Department of Microbiology and Immunology. Further, several  programs in the Department and the University support research training  for undergraduate students, minority high school teachers and minority  high school students. Thus, the instrumentation proposed for this  Shared DNA Sequencing Facility will significantly enhance the research  and research training environment within the Department of Microbiology  and Immunology. In support of this, the Department of Microbiology and  Immunology has committed funds to support a technician dedicated to the  facility, and to support the service contracts necessary to maintain  the facility for the initial three years of operation.    Although the Shared DNA Sequencing Facility will be housed in the  Department of Microbiology and Immunology, the facility will be  available to all investigators on the Oklahoma City campus, subject to  user fees to help defray costs. Thus, this facility will have  significant impact outside the Department, enriching the research and  research training capability of the entire University of Oklahoma  Health Science Center campus. Consistent with this potential, we have  obtained significant institutional support for this Shared DNA  Sequencing Facility, as the Health Sciences Center has pledged matching  funds (dollar-for-dollar) to purchase the instrumentation to be housed  in this facility.",
