 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522733  Taghaboni-Dutta   This is a research planning grant aimed at integrating decisions on the problem of facilities layout and the specification of guide path configuration for automated guided vehicle (AGV) system in a flexible manufacturing environment. Automated guided vehicles are computer controlled mobile material handling equipment that operate on a network of guide wire buried in a plant floor. The size and configuration of the guide wire network is a design problem whose solution depends on the characteristics of material flow in the shop, the  creativity of the network designer,  and the design criterion selected  The ultimate objective of this research  is to develop methodologies for the concurrent specification of  both the layout of a shop (i.e., the arrangement of departments or workstations) and the flow path of automated guided vehicles. As a prelude to the main research, the research planning grant will be used to undertake the background work necessary to prepare a full proposal that pursues the ultimate objective.  In the main research to be pursued, the design of the facility layout and the layout of the guidepath will be based on the minimization of the total travel time needed to move the required volume of material through the plant floor. Although the current  focus is on AGV system, the research experience and insight gained will be used to extend the work to other types of material handling systems such as monorails and overhead cranes.   However, in the research planning grant phase, the research objectives are (1) to explore similar (concurrent design) problems in other areas, and (2) to investigate potential solution techniques. The solution techniques to be investigated include simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.    Facilities layout and material handling are two highly interrelated subsystems in a manufacturing system. Despite this strong relationship, very little research that focused on their design integration have been reported. There are several  benefits that can be realized through the concurrent design of both the layout and the material handling systems of a facility. Concurrent design of a layout and an AGV system will lead to a more efficient material flow, less traffic control problems, and proper accountability and location of buffers for both idle vehicles and materials. Furthermore, not only will it guard against locating too far apart machine stations that have high material flow volume between them but also ensures that aisle directions for traffic flow are well oriented.  This will reduce shop floor congestion,  reduce work-in-process due to improved flow, and reduced order throughput time.",
