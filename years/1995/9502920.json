The  experiments will investigate the physical effects behind the  profound and sometimes  spectacular changes (e.g.,the  superconductor to insulator transition) that occur in electronic  systems in the strongly disordered limit in two dimensions.  The  ultra-thin metal films are fabricated in situ by thermal  evaporation of the constituent metals onto substrates held at  temperatures near 4 K. Experiments with the scanning tunneling  microscope will measure the atomic surface structure as well as  variations in their local tunneling density of states.  The  experiments are of interest from fundamental viewpoints, as well  as technical viewpoints, as the results will increase our  understanding of electronic conduction processes in metals.  %%%  This experimental project involves low temperature scanning  tunneling microscopy and electron magneto-transport and tunneling  measurements on  strongly disordered ultrathin films.
