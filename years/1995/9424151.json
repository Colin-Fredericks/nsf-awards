 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morrison    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Kathleen Morrison  and her collaborators will conduct archaeological research at the  site of Vijayanagara, located in Southern India. The city of  Vijayanagara was the capital of an empire that claimed control  over much of peninsular India between the 14th and 16th centuries  A.D. It was established in an area that had never been  politically central or densely occupied and the rapid expansion  of the city in the early years of the 14th century prompted  dramatic changes in the organization and scale of production of  agriculture and craft goods. In the early 16th century  Vijayanagara again underwent a period of expansion in miliary  conquest, construction of monumental architecture and also  population. This situation provides Dr. Morrison with an  excellent opportunity to investigate processes of economic  change. Building on five previous seasons of research, her  project will examine the structure of production, settlement,  transportation and fortification in the region immediately  surrounding the city. Three independent lines of evidence,  archaeological, historical and botanical will be combined in the  analysis of this region. The team will continue their program of  systematic intensive surface survey. They will also collect cores  for both plant macrofosil and microfossil analysis. Finally  historical research based on inscriptions will provide important  economic and chronological information.    Archaeologists wish to understand how complex societies manage  economies with allow large number of people to sustain themselves  with relatively simple production techniques. In particular Dr.  Morrison is focussing on economic aspects of production and  consumption and wishes to understand in detail human environment  interactions. She will examine the effect over time of  agriculture, craft production and domestic activities. The cores  and selected excavations will yield charcoal and plant remains  which, through careful analy sis, will provide insight into  environmental changes.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our  understanding of how complex societies develop and are maintained  and will provide a wealth of information on human - environmental  interactions.",
