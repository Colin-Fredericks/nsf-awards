 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Doron Zeilberger in  the areas of algebraic combinatorics, the theory of special  functions, and computer algebra. One direction of this project is  a continuation of his research program on the use of computer  algebra for computerized proofs of identities in combinatorics  and the theory of special functions. Other goals of this project  include the development of a general theory of permutation  statistics, the study of holonomic aspects of combinatorial  statistical mechanics, and the extension of methods developed in  the principal investigator's recent proof of the alternating sign  matrix conjecture to other, still open, problems in this area.  Because both special functions and combinatorics are so prevalent  in the natural sciences, this research has many potential  applications to both science and technology, as well as to pure  mathematics.    This research is in the general area of combinatorics.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how  discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of  discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For example, the design of large networks, such as those  occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this  makes use of combinatorial research.",
