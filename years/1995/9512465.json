This joint seminar  will be held in Seoul, Korea, September 25-28, 1995.  The  participation of fourteen U.S. scientists/engineers will be  supported under this award. The joint seminar will have several  major interest areas including the following: structural analysis  and design; better performing structural materials;  transportation systems; tunnel and underground structures;  lifeline systems; sensoring, monitoring and control; management,  maintenance, and rehabilitation; and social and economic  considerations.    CIS research is one of NSF's seven primary strategic research  areas.  It is an area of increasing importance, especially in  East Asia where infrastructure development is expected to keep  pace with growing economic power.  The PI and his Korean  collaborator are exceptionally well qualified to organize and  conduct such a joint seminar.  Both are top scholars who are  internationally renowned for their academic and professional  achievements.  The PI has been a member of the National Academy  of Engineering since 1977.  Dr. Choi recently received the  prestigious National Engineering Medal awarded by the Korean  government.  Both collaborators have successfully organized past  international meetings.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which  seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and  Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual interest and benefit.  Korean  participation is supported by the Korea Science and  Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).  Other East Asian participants will be  supported from other sources.  ***",
