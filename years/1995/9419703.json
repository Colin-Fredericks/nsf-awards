 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419703  Turgeon  Phloem loading is the transport process in which  carbohydrate, synthesized by mesophyll cells, is transferred  to the vascular tissue (phloem) of leaves in preparation for  long-distance translocation to other organs.  A new model of  phloem loading has been put forward by Dr. Turgeion for  those species that translocate stachyose in addition to  sucrose.  Possibly one-third of all dicotyledonous species  are in this group.  According to this model, sucrose  diffuses from the mesophyll cells into a specialized type of  companion cell (the intermediary cell) in the minor veins  and is converted there into stachyose.  Diffusion occurs  through numerous branched plasmodesmata linking bundle  sheath cells to intermediary cells.  The stachyose  accumulates in the intermediary cells and sieve elements  because it is too large to diffuse back into the mesophyll.    This award supports experimental studies into the dynamics  of intermediary cell phlasmodesmata ultrastructure.  These  plasmodesmata are especially narrow on the intermediary cell  side and this constriction is the possible site of  discrimination between transport of sucrose in one direction  and stachyose in the other.  Cryofixation will be used to  preserve plasmodesmata structure, which will be studied in  mature leaves before and after a reduction in carbohydrate  content.  Confocal microscope investigations with membrane-  specific dyes will determine whether the small vacuoles in  intermediary cells, which may be involved in transport of  sugar through the cell, originate from the vacuolar system  or the endoplasmic reticulum.  These studies will  concentrate on Cucumis melo and Cucurbita pepo but other  stachyose-translocation species may also be employed.",
