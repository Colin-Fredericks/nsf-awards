 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419952  Miller   The Generic Flora of the Southeastern United States project is a collaborative effort between the University of Florida and the New York State Museum, building upon prior work done at Harvard University. The taxonomic research leads to comprehensive treatments for all 1320 genera in 193 families of seed plants estimated to occur in the Southeast.  These treatments include technical descriptions, identification keys, summaries of the biology of a genus, annotated bibliographies of pertinent literature, and original illustrations of morphological details.  They summarize what is known about many aspects of the plant resources of a large part of North America, especially taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships, economic uses, and ecological status.  Currently 140 installments have been published, of an estimated 186 total.  During Phase III, all monocot families including such large and challenging groups as the grasses (Gramineae) and most lily family relatives, the mint family (Lamiaceae) and its relatives, and numerous other groups will be completed, in all about 350 genera.   The Generic Flora treatments are widely used by plant scientists, horticulturists, resource managers, and conservationists.  Various products, including an index to all published treatments, are now available electronically through InterNet access on the New York State Library gopher server.",
