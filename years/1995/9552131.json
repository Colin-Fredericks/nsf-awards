 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computer science department is developing a course laboratory  component--based on a networked computer laboratory-- for its  upper-division undergraduate course on the principles of  telecommunication and computer networks.   Students in this course  benefit from well-designed programming assignments that illustrate  and reinforce the principles discussed in lecture classes.   The  laboratory adapts easily to different network hardware and software  configurations, enabling students to fully explore a wide range of  telecommunication issues, from bit-level signal transmission to  Internet exploration.   Advanced students from related departments  benefit as well as computer science majors.   The computer  laboratory is also used to enhance exploration of traditional,  networked, and distributed operating systems in the computer  operating systems course.   This project presents the student with  an integrated view of telecommunications and operating systems.    Project development and results will be recorded and disseminated  through workshop participation, conference presentation, and  journal publication.",
