 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the effects of environmental  regulation on the demand for labor.  The changes that these  regulations induce in the technology of production will affect  labor demand in the manufacturing sectors of the developed world  and in the rapidly growing manufacturing sectors of the  developing world.    Worldwide growth in manufacturing output and trade has prompted  concern for the effect of economic growth on environmental  quality.  Regulatory stringency is expected to increase in both  the developed and the developing world.  Arguments against  regulation are often framed in terms of a tradeoff between jobs  and environmental quality.  The investigators argue that existing  estimates of the effect of investment in pollution abatement on  labor demand are conflicting and subject to a number of biases.  Estimates of job loss provided by economists are likely to be  biased downwards, as much of the observed investment is conducted  in anticipation of regulatory change by firms who face low  compliance costs.  Estimates of job loss provided by firms are  likely to be biased upwards, as they ignore the effect that the  same regulatory changes will have on their competitors prices for  output.    This project will provide estimates of the effect of regulation  on labor demand free of these biases.  The selection bias will be  treated by using regulatory as instrumental variables, thus  restricting attention to firms forced to invest in pollution  abatement by regulatory changes.  The upward bias in firms'  estimates is addressed by separately estimating the output  elasticities of labor demand and the marginal rate of technical  substitution between pollution abatement capital and labor.      Data on state and local regulatory changes will be combined with  plant level data on pollution abatement investment and on  employment from the Census of Manufactures to provide estimates.  To ensure that the instruments have explanatory power, additional  data will be collected on s harp changes associated with two  regulatory programs: The South Coast Air Quality Management  District in Southern California and the Delaware River Basin  project.  Estimated effects will inform policy makers about how  large the tradeoff really is between environmental quality and  manufacturing jobs.  ***",
