 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553345  Azadivar  A comprehensive manufacturing learning center (the MLC) will be  developed.  Just as teaching hospitals are full service medical  facilities yet provide a research and educational environment for  medical students and other health professionals to get hands-on  training solving real-life medical problems; this proposed center  would have a fully actualized manufacturing function integrated  into manufacturing engineering education capabilities. The center  would utilize an existing research and technology transfer  facility where students and trainees can intern in actual  manufacturing situations solving real-life manufacturing  problems. The MLC would enhance the manufacturing engineering  education and provide a research/education/ technology transfer  model for others to emulate.  The manufacturing theme encompasses  a wide range of engineering activities. The theme allows training  and education for a large group of professionals in many  engineering and other supporting disciplines. It would also  addresses a critical need for development of human resources in  an area of economic activity that has been suffering in recent  years.    The MLC will utilize the existing full service \"manufacturing  processes prototyping\" plant at Kansas State University. This  research/teaching/manufacturing facility would bridge research  and engineering education at Kansas State University and the  research and development needs of small to medium-sized  industries.  The MLC will be managed and run by a partnership of  KSU' s Advanced Manufacturing Institute (AMI), faculty and  students in the Engineering and other Colleges of the University,  technical and vocational schools in the state, two technical  assistance organizations in the region and managers and  manufacturing experts from private manufacturing firms.",
