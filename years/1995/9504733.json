 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David J. Norris  has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Norris received his doctoral degree from   the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the supervision of   Professor Moungi Bawendi.  Dr. Norris will continue research at   International Business Machines Almaden Research Center under the   sponsorship of Dr. W. E. Moerner, Research Staff Member in the Laser   Materials and Interactions Group.  His postdoctoral research will target   the optical spectroscopy of individual impurity molecules embedded in   crystalline or polymer matrices utilizing methods developed by Moerner at   IBM and near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM).  The field is   extremely young, and many possible areas of investigation exist.  Dr.   Norris anticipates the study of binary systems; that is, two molecules   which are spatially discrete but in close proximity to each other.  This   situation will allow the investigation of interactions between two   isolated molecules as a function of distance.  Depending on the model   system chosen, these experiments could study important processes such as   electron transfer, energy transfer, or relaxation dynamics.  As with   previous single molecule work, these experiments may demonstrate new and   unexpected phenomena.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
