 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311113  Olson         A central mission of the JGOFS project in the Arabian  Sea is to determine how efficiently the carbon pump operates  in this region and how it responds to changes in physical  forcing.  To approach these problems we need to analyze the  structure of the food web and determine how it varies with  geographical and temporal gradients in nutrients supply and  water column mixing.  The juxtaposition of productive and  oligotrophic oceanic systems in the Arabian Sea, and the  regular oscillation between very high and low rates of  nutrient supply under relatively constant conditions of  solar illumination, offers opportunities for us to gain  insights into food web regulation processes.       In this project, Dr. Olson will (1) Characterize the  distribution, abundance, and light scatter properties of the  picoplankton and nanoplankton at the four intensive stations  and at selected intermediate stations, using dual beam flow  cytometry and DNA specific staining to distinguish  heterotrophic as well as autotrophic organisms;  (2)  Estimate in situ growth rates of specific groups of  phytoplankton, and grazing pressure on these groups, from  diel patterns in cell number, light scatter properties and  DNA content of individual cells from depth profiles; and (3)  Test the hypothesis that the phytoplankton are  physiologically  N-limited during non-monsoon periods by  measuring the C:N ratios of phytoplankton ( in particular,  coccolithophores and picoplankton) purified by cell sorting.  Relative responses of different groups of phytoplankton to N  enrichment will be determined from 14C bicarbonate  incubation experiments followed by cell sorting to obtain  cell-specific growth rates.",
