 "awd_abstract_narration": "SBR-9508550    This dissertation-improvement award will assist the Student's work in a village in northern  India, where she will combine ethnographic methods and field measurement to investigate  four sets of issues:  (1) the relationships between the spatial patterns of indigenous versus  non-indigenous knowledge of tree-management practices;  (2) relationships between tree-  management knowledge and the socio-economic and biophysical characteristics of the  immediate area;  (3) relationships between access to different sources of knowledge and  gender and socio-economic status;  (4) the effect of communication with non-village forest  managers on the distribution of tree-management-knowledge application among villagers;   and (5) ways in which individuals and households resolve discontinuities between knowledge  received from different sources.  The Student will undertake a resource and ownership  survey, and participant observation and interviews to elicit tree-management knowledge and  its sources.  The Student will analyze these data via structured qualitative and quantitative  methods.  This case study should contribute to the scientific understanding of how practical  knowledge is diffused and used, and thereby should contribute to practical attempts to diffuse  \"best-practice\" techniques among local populations.",
