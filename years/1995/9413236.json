The program provides training for undergraduate and graduate students in detailed understanding the role of transition metals, such as iron, molybdenum and tungsten, in a variety of biological systems.  The general area is sometimes called inorganic biochemistry; its importance is underlined by observations that indicate that at least a third of known enzymes include a transition metal ion.  Areas of research pursued by the faculty include systematics, genetics and metabolism of hyperthermophilic bacteria, structure-function studies of a variety of metalloproteins of bacterial, fungal and mammalian origin, regulation of gene transcription by mercury, and de novo design and synthesis of metalloproteins.    The collaborative research and training sponsored by the RTG has three facets, all aimed at providing trainees with an understanding of where metalloproteins come from, their role in the organism, and the structure and function of metalloproteins at the molecular level.  The first facet involves undergraduates in faculty research programs during the summer; students are recruited nationally with emphasis on students at small colleges who might otherwise not have the opportunity to participate in hands-on research.  The second facet is directed at graduate students; required training includes lecture and laboratory courses in microbial genetics, enzymology, bioinorganic chemistry, and molecular modeling, other required and elective courses, and thesis research.  The third major portion of the training program is a 10-day summer workshop taught by RTG and external faculty.  About 25 RTG students and 50 first or second-year graduate students and a few postdocs and junior faculty from other U.S. institutions attend the workshop.  The workshop will continue on a biennial basis duri ng the renewal period as NSF support phases out.  Though the workshop was first offered in 1991, it has already had a significant impact on the education of graduate students from around the country.    ***",
