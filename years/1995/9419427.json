 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419427  Manson  The PI will develop and extend the theory of scattering of  small mass particles by surfaces, with emphasis on  interactions in which many quanta of energy are exchanged  during the collision.  The results of this work will provide  useful information on the dynamics of surface atom motions  and it will give information on the interaction potential  between the atomic projectile and the surface thorough  determination of the scattering form factors.  The theory  will be developed to handle the entire range of experimental  conditions from fully quantum mechanical conditions to  classical scattering.  The PI will carry out extensive  numerical calculations for helium atom scattering from clean  and ordered surfaces, from adsorbates, and from Langmuir-  Blodgett and self assembly films.  This program of work will  involve collaboration with some of the major experimental  groups in helium-surface scattering, including those at  Florida State, Gottingen, and Julich.  ***  This work involves developing the theory needed to interpret  experimental work on the scattering of small mass particles,  such as helium atoms, from surfaces.  Such experiments give  properties of the surface itself and also the interaction  between the projectile and the surface.  The computer will  be used to simulate scattering from clean surfaces, surfaces  with less than a layer of other types of atoms on it, and  films of large molecules which can be put on layer by layer.  These films are important in the production of computer  chips.  The PI plans to continue his long-term, close  collaboration with experimental groups at Florida State  University and at Gottinger and Julich in Germany.  He is  the principle theorist in the United States who helps  interpret these experiments.  ***",
