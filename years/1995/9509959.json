 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal funded jointly by the Divisions of Chemistry and   Materials Research, McCullough will synthesize and characterize novel   conducting organic polymers and oligomers designed to yield predictable,   oriented structures using self-assembly, ion-binding, and/or biomimetic   assembly methods.  The self-assembling, conducting systems are based on   oligomers and polymers of thiophenes or pyrroles with functionalized side   chains.  Information about self-assembly in electronic and photonic   oligomeric materials will result from study of the synthesized oligomers.    The electrical, structural, and non-linear optical properties of each of   these new oligomers and polymers will be examined in detail in order to   focus on strategies for the design and control of structures and   properties in advanced materials.   The research performed in this work is not only of fundamental interest,   but it also forms the basis for exciting new technology for the coming   century.  Among the electronic and photonic applications of the materials   to be examined in this project are optical modulators, imaging materials,   light-emitting diodes and displays, smart windows, and nanoelectronic and   optical devices.",
