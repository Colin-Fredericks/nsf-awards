 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506360  Zimmerman    Essentially nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms nor the  genes involved in regulating differentiation and morphogenesis  during early embryogenesis in higher plants. This proposal  describes the molecular and genetic analysis on one of the earliest  stages of embryogenesis, the globular stage, Dr. Zimmerman has  chosen this stage because it is during the globular stage that all  of the basic tissue systems of the mature plant are initiated and  the primary meristems are established. She has identified two  globular defective Arabidopsis mutants that show interesting  defects in development during the globular stage. One of these  mutants may exhibit a homeotic transformation of one embryo cell  type to another, and the other mutant shows defects in tissue  organization and the transition to polarized growth. Each of these  mutations appears to be caused by T-DNA insertion, and hence the  genes of interest should be tagged; indeed, Dr. Zimmerman has  already cloned one of the genes using T-DNA as a probe. She will  use these mutants to address fundamental questions regarding the  molecular basis for cellular identity, tissue differentiation and  organization in plant embryogenesis. In order to begin to address  these questions, she will 1) characterize the phenotype and timing  of developmental interference in each mutant, 2) genetically map  the mutations relative to known chromosomal markers and relative to  other embryo defective genes, and in the longer term, 3) isolate  and characterize the tagged genes responsible for the mutations in  order to evaluate the molecular and developmental consequences of  these mutations.  ***",
