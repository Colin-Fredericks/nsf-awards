 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501550  Leisure    Ultrasonic  methods will be used to study hydrogen isotope  motion  in  the  rare-earth  metals,  and possibly  other  metals  as  well.   The  objectives of these studies will be to elucidate the unusual  dynamics  of  hydrogen  in  these materials.  Experiments will be  performed  on  scandium,  lutetium,  and yttrium single crystals containing  hydrogen  and/or  deuterium.   The experimental results will  be  used  to  test  modern  theories  of  quantum diffusion in solids.   The  movement  of  hydrogen  ions  between  the  lowest  vibrational  levels  of   nearby  interstitial  sites in a metal may be regarded as a  two-level  system  (TLS).   The  usual theory  assumes weak coupling of the  TLS  to  the  environment,  so  that  the  quantum  coherence  of  the  TLS  is  not  destroyed.   It  has been realized recently that the usual  theory  is  severely restricted because, in many cases the coupling of the TLS  to  electrons  in  metals,  or to phonons at higher  temperatures  in  any  material,   destroys  the  quantum  coherence.   Modern  theories   of  dissipative  quantum tunneling are not restricted to weak coupling  to  the electrons or phonons.  Novel ultrasonic techniques will be applied  to  several other problems.  Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy will  be  used  to  measure the complete set of elastic constants  of  materials  undergoing  phase transitions.  With the construction  of  a  10  kbar  pressure cell, the complete set of elastic constants of small  samples  will be measured under pressure.  %%%  Sound  waves  in  the frequency range 100 kHz to 100 Mhz  (ultrasound)  will  be  used  to study the motion of hydrogen ions in several  rare-  earth metals.  Hydrogen is highly mobile in these metals and moves  by  hopping  among  the  interstitial sites provided  by  the  host  metal  lattice.  The hydrogen motion is affected by the interactions  of  the  hydrogen ions with the host metal atoms via tbe thermal vibrations and  conduction  electrons of th e host metal. Hydrogen motion  affects  the  speed  and energy loss of the ultrasonic waves which are the  measured  quantities.   Low-temperature  hydrogen motion  cannot  be  understood  using   classical   physics,   but   requires   a   quantum-mechanical  description.  The hydrogen moves between nearby interstitial sites  by  quantum-mechanical tunneling, and the tunneling particle  is  strongly  affected by interactions with both the lattice thermal vibrations  and  conduction  electrons.   The resulting  motion is  called  dissipative  quantum tunneling.  It is an open question as to whether the theory of  dissipative  quantum  tunneling can quantitatively  describe  the  low  temperature  motion of hydrogen isotopes in metals,  and  it  is  this  question which the proposed study intends to answer.  A second part of  the  work  will  involve  the use of novel  ultrasonic  techniques  to  measure the elastic properties of materials undergoing a  phase change  and   of   materials   under  pressure.   The   ability   to   measure  simultaneously the complete set of elastic constants at high  pressure  will be unique.  ***",
