 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310702  Buesseler       One of the major research objectives of the U.S.JGOFS  Arabian Sea Process Study is measurement of the vertical and  horizontal transport rates of particulate material, especially  particulate organic carbon, in the Arabian Sea.  Particle export  from the surface layers of the ocean is of particular interest  because that is the zone where new biological particles are  formed, grazed, and physically altered, and then enter the  decomposition cycle that regenerates dissolved nutrients.  Although some investigators will be making such estimates by  setting out open canisters at different depths and measuring the  amount of material that collects in them over time, such efforts  have a number of built-in uncertainties.       The principal investigator of the present project, will  approach the problem of estimating particle export from the  surface ocean in a radically different way, on that will serve as  an independent check on the sediment trap estimates.  His  approach takes advantage of the fact that the dissolved uranium  in seawater decays to produce a radioactive daughter, thoraium-  234 (half-life-24 days), which (unlike the uranium) strongly  attaches to particles. By sampling particles within and below the  mixed upper water layer and measuring their TH-234 content and  using some simple mathematical models, the investigator will be  able to estimate particle from the mixed layer to depth.  By  measuring carbon and nitrogen contents of these materials, he  will also be able to estimate fluxes of those two elements.  A  regional particulate carbon flux picture for the Arabian Sea  region will be built up by using the data from some 25 stations  collected during two monsoonal seasons (summer and winter) and  two intermonsoonal periods.  ***",
