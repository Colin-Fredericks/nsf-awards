 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of digital image and video compression and communications  has seen growing activity in recent years, including  standardization efforts such as JPEG and MPEG, and an increased  number of current or proposed applications from Cable or Satellite  TV to videoconferencing and future multimedia services. This trend  will continue to create an incentive for new compression techniques  that are more efficient as well as better adapted to the particular  transmission environments. The main thrust of this research is to  provide adaptive compression techniques for video communications.    Adaptive techniques are those where encoders are capable of  matching their encoding procedure to the local characteristics of  the source or the  channel. Rate-distortion optimal solutions and  fast heuristic approximations are being obtained for some of the  problems of interest in video communications, such as bit  allocation and rate control. A novel scalar adaptive quantizer,  close in spirit to arithmetic coding, is being investigated. This  new technique, combined with such popular quantization techniques  as trellis coded quantization, will be used in real encoding  situations. Convergence and asymptotic properties of this scheme  are also being studied. For variable channel situations where  transmission resources are shared, as in ATM networks for instance,  rate constraints for each video connection are being designed to  enable good individual video quality as well as efficient overall  network utilization.    This research is being carried out in the Digital Video  Communications research laboratory that is currently being set up  within the Signal and Image Processing Institute. Our main  education goal is to provide teaching in the area of signal, image  and video processing. We will introduce a digital video  communications course, designed to cover material that is specific  of video compression including the relevant communications aspects,  and to provide hands-on experience for the students .",
