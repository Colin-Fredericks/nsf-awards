 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, four Lafayette Instrument Minigraph  computer interfaces and four P-60 Pentium IBM-compatible computer  systems linked by a Pentium/66 network server are purchased in  order to enhance the laboratory component of the curriculum of  the Psychology Department.   The most important improvements are  for the laboratory course, Physiological Psychology, in which the  equipment can be used regularly during weekly laboratory sessions  that are limited to 12 students per session.   These computers  permit hands-on experience with state-of-the-art technology for  laboratory exercises and provide students with expertise in  computer-based research technology in psychophysiology.   The  computers also enhance utilization of existing polygraphic  equipment by permitting real-time analysis and automated data  processing of physiological measures recorded in laboratory  exercises.   In addition, sophisticated data collection and  analysis by senior students completing independent study projects  is made possible.   These improvements in the education of  psychology majors better prepare them for research in graduate  school.",
