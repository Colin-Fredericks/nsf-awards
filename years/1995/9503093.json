 "awd_abstract_narration": "While hardware issues are important, it is ultimately the software that will determine the success of  virtual environment applications.  One important new area of virtual environment software research is  in 3D interaction: how should such applications behave interactively and what software architectures  should they use? Since user input is relatively low-bandwidth, future solutions to these problems will  have enormous processing power to draw upon.  Recently, several developments have emerged in various  fields which hold great promise for advancing 3D interaction research. Examples are: object-oriented  frameworks, incremental hierarchical constraint solvers, automatic recognition of hand gestures,  inverse kinematics algorithms, and physically-based models of rigid or deformable objects.  Because of  the complexity of developing 3D interaction software, reusable software libraries are clearly needed.  While some virtual environment software libraries are currently available, there are no higher-level  toolkits available which incorporate these newer ideas, are publicly available and written in a  standar d object-oriented language. This research project will investigate what form of software  architecture a modern, high-level 3D interaction toolkit should take, build an implementation of one  in C++, and make a documented version publicly available for researchers and developers of virtual  environment applications. Such a high-level software framework would serve as a catalyst for  researchers developing highly interactive virtual environments in the sciences, medicine, engineering  and industry.",
