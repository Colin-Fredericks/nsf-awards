Carbon monoxide (CO) is a  reactive species which controls the OH concentration in many parts  of the remote atmosphere.  The isotopes of atmospheric carbon  monoxide can be used to constrain both the OH concentration as well  as the relative source strengths of CO.  In the first case, 14CO is  measured to constrain OH concentrations.  Since the 14CO cosmogenic  production rate is known, its loss rate, and therefore the average  OH concentration, can be deduced if the atmospheric inventory is  determined.  In the second case, the stable isotopes (13CO and C18O)  are measured to help assess the relative source strengths, since  certain sources of CO have characteristic isotopic signatures.         The main sources of CO are methane oxidation by OH, non-  methane hydrocarbon oxidation by OH, biomass burning, and fossil  fuel combustion.  However, the relative importance of these sources  is poorly known.  Determining the atmospheric abundance and  seasonality of the isotopes of CO will provide important  information concerning the relative magnitude of those sources.   During the 1970's and 1980's CO has been increasing at a rate of  about 1% per year, but for the last three to five years, this trend  has reversed direction, and CO has been decreasing globally at a  rate of 6-7% per year.  The causes of these interannual variations  are not known.  Analysis of the isotopic composition of CO can help  constrain the relative source rates.         The PI proposes to build a clean air sampling system and  cryogenic vacuum extraction line which will allow for the  collection, separation, and analysis of air samples for the  isotopes of carbon monoxide (14CO, 13CO, and C18O), and to then begin  measurement of these isotopes from air samples collected at the  Mauna Loa Observatory (in collaboration with the NOAA CMDL   facility) and from samples collected in-flight between California  and New Zealand.",
