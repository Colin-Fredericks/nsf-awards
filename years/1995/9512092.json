 "awd_abstract_narration": "We address the problem of inferring the evolutionary history of a  set of natural languages. The methodology we propose can be used  when languages are described by qualitative characters, where  qualitative characters are functions (based upon linguistic  properties, such as sounds and lexical items) which define  partitions of the set of natural languages into distinct  equivalence classes. Evolutionary trees are also inferred for  biological taxa described by qualitative characters, and perhaps  the most popular method for constructing evolutionary trees in  biology is based upon the parsimony criterion. We have developed  a methodology for encoding linguistic information as qualitative  characters and efficient algorithms for constructing the most  parsimonious trees for linguistic data which promise to provide  robust and significantly more informative trees than can be  obtained using any of the previous methods to date. A direct  consequence of the methodology we are developing is the ability  to test hypotheses;  in particular, this methodology enables the  linguist to determine whether the particular linguistic  information is evolutionarily relevant, and whether the  interpretation of the information is correct.         We will produce algorithms and software which will quickly  generate the most parsimonious trees for a given data set. These  methods have the promise of greatly improving the ability of  historical linguists to derive evolutionary trees because of the  following:         Character data has not been fully used by historical            linguists, who have instead had to rely upon distance data       or only those characters which are completely directed.         Character-based methods, since based upon primary data.       provide information about evolutionary history that cannot       reliably be obtained through the use of distance data       (distances are compressions of multi-dimensional information       into a single dimension).         The methods we will develo p will probably return optimal       trees in polynomial time, and will also determine those       aspects of phylogenetic trees which hold for all solutions       to the input.",
