Resources from a  consortium of higher education institutions, the Rhode Island  Department of Education, community organizations and agencies,  and the private sector will be combined to implement an  integrated, hands-on, kit-based science curriculum in the  elementary schools of the eight school districts in EBEC.  The  project will make a long term commitment to bringing this  curriculum into the middle and high schools.    During the project, elementary teachers will work cooperatively  with academic and industry scientists to learn effective science  teaching methods through the use of nationally acclaimed and  validated modular units.  Science professionals will keep linked  together with the teachers via the Internet throughout the  project so to build ongoing support and leadership for systemic  change.    During the five-year project, there will be four two-year cycles  of professional development.  Year one will consist of a seven-  day summer institute to explore modular units that will be  implemented in the classroom.  Direct support for project  teachers will be included throughout the school year. Year two  will be a three-day \"mini-institute\" to re-examine all four  modules used in year one and discuss instructional strategies and  interests.  Preservice college students will co-teach with new  project teachers during this year.  Six hundred EBEC teachers  will be enhanced over the life of the project and 800 preservice  college students will have participated in the project.    Cost sharing is 219% of the total NSF requested budget.  9453159  Kniseley  This Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement project is  the result of a collaboration between the East Bay Educational  Collaborative (EBEC) and Rhode Island College.
