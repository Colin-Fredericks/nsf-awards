This meeting focused on the applications   of computer algebra  systems  (CAS) in engineering, applied mathematics, pure   mathematics, and  education.  It was the first international meeting of this   type.  This meeting  was particularly timely because of the great strides  made in   using deep computer  algebra results like the Grobner  Basis and quantifier-  elimination algorithms  and their  generalizations to produce significant results in   equations, in the analysis and implementation of discrete   methods  for  differential equations, to control theory, and to many other    areas.  The use of  computer-algebra techniques is growing rapidly  in most if   not all engineering  and science areas and thus the  dissemination of the latest   techniques is  important and are not covered by disciplinary meetings.",
