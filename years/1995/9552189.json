 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve student understanding of  physics concepts, attract interest, and improve retention through  the use of computer technology.   Having tested the concept (as a  pilot project) taken from Ron Thornton and Priscilla Laws during  the past 2 years, this investigator and cal-based Physics 213  students have demonstrated the advantages of the  microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) method.   Students can be  actively involved in lab activities and can experiment with  different data.   The success of the pilot project causes this  investigator to expand MBL into physics and physical science  courses.   This enhanced lab provides students with effective  learning experiences to support lecture theory.   In addition to  increasing learning, exposure to new lab instrumentation and  technology makes the students more competitive with peers upon  transfer to a senior college or entrance into the workforce.    Partial implementation of the Conceptual Exercises/Overview Case  Study (CE/OCS) method has begun and is being expanded into  others.    The project provides support for six workstations  equipped with Mac Quadra 630 computers, appropriate software, and  supplementary lab equipment to implement redesigned and newly  developed lab experiments.   Up to 24 students per course in 6  different courses can benefit and be better prepared for the  technologies of the twenty-first century.",
