 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the role that regulations and insurance can play in  reducing losses from earthquakes, hurricanes and windstorms while at the same time alleviating the  financial burden to victims from these types of disasters.  The project is timely as there is a  concern by both the insurance industry and federal agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA) about these issues.  The research will specifically focus on the effects of a  catastrophic loss on insurers and reinsurers.  The behavior of firms in the industry will be modeled  to derive a set of testable hypotheses regarding their future actions.  A set of empirical studies  will then be undertaken through case studies, surveys, and interviews with key decision makers in  insurance and reinsurance firms.  Hurricane Andrew, the single most costly natural disaster in the  insurance industry s history, offers an opportunity to examine the hypotheses by looking at its impact  on surplus, future premiums, available coverage, and ability to obtain reinsurance coverage.  The  prescriptive analysis will  contrast the implications of dealing with earthquake, hurricanes, and  windstorms where private insurers and reinsurers are responsible for covering all insured losses with  a policy that incorporates some type of federal reinsurance for covering catastrophic losses.",
