International  collaboration has become essential for the analysis of important  scientific problems related to these issues.  This project will  support the participation of about 50 key U.S. researchers,  including new-career scholars, at the XIV Congress of the  international Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) in Berlin,  Germany, August 2-10, 1995.  Owing to its strong multidisciplinary  tradition, INQUA has direct relevance to seven programs within NSF.  The scientific contacts achieved at this meeting and the related  scientific field excursions will be invaluable for enhancing  understanding of the dynamic earth system at a critical point.  The  habitability of the planet depends of this understanding and its  application to real Earth problems within the coming decade or so.    A similar travel grant program supported attendance by 32 U.S.  Quaternary scientists (including ten delegates) at INQUA XIII in  Beijing in 1991.  The U.S. with a total attendance of 108  scientists made a strong showing, especially in the areas of  paleoclimatic modeling, oceanography and paleoecology.  Numerous  favorable written reports (available for scrutiny on demand) by the  scientists whose travel was subsidized clearly attest to the long-  term value of such international meetings and the scientific  contacts they foster.",
