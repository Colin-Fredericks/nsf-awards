 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553639  Tinker    This project will vastly expand the range of contexts in which  students can learn science, mathematics, and technology by  providing flexible tools that help them extract data and meaning in  the complex, real world. We will bring a full range of computer and  networking tools outside the lab for explorations of rich, natural  settings (the field, classroom, school, neighborhood, town and  city) where we expect students will develop understandings and  investigative strategies that will last a lifetime. The project  will use portable MBL and client-server based wireless networking-  advanced technologies already beginning to make their appearance  and certain to be inexpensive, powerful, and widely available in  five to ten years.    The technology will make it possible for students to make digital  journal observations, gather a range of kinds of data, consolidate  data from others, reflect on the data, link findings with  background information and data, develop models based on these  data, and communicate with others. Used with intelligent prompting,  scaffolding, various data representations, and data exchange forms  at their fingertips, we expect to see far more student reflection  and analysis in the field. This will result in deeper learning,  better use of time, and the possibility of additional cycles of  observations and analysis.    In order to test the educational potential of this technology, we  will develop a series of innovative units that employ the  technology to support new ways to teach about scientific  measurement, modeling, mapping, and investigations. At the same  time we will test new instructional strategies using this  technology to develop holistic models of the natural, built, and  social environment. The instructional strategy will be based on a  learning cycle that starts and ends with field investigations, but,  in between, also uses the same technology in a lab.    Using this approach, we expect student inquiry to be more  efficient, student i nvestigations will be more expert, the  resulting knowledge will be less inert , and many new topics will  be amenable to student investigation. In addition, students will  become more acquainted with their vocational choices. These results  will have important implications on the practicality of widespread  use of extended student investigations, equity, home study, and the  school-to-work transition.    The project will require four years, with the primary technology  and curriculum, development in the first two years, final design in  the third, and a full year of testing in the fourth.  ***",
