Numerical experiments with idealized models will be performed to examine  the utility of different strategies for ensemble prediction.  the reduced dimension of the models  will allow the principal investigator and his colleagues to perform experiments with much larger  ensemble sizes than would be feasible with complex, operational forecast models.  Archived  operational ensemble predictions produced by the National Meteorological Center will be  examined to test diagnostic techniques and methods for predicting forecast skill suggested by the  idealized model experiments.         The research will focus on three critical topics:  (1) the method of constructing the initial  conditions for ensemble runs; (2) determining the optimal number of ensemble members required  for useful estimates of the most probable forecast state and (3) how systematic errors in the  model affect the efficacy of the ensemble prediction.         This research has an enormous potential for contributing to the improvement of  operational medium-range weather forecasts.  ***",
