 "awd_abstract_narration": "Johnson C. Smith University (JCSU) is the recipient of funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program for the replacement and renovation of research space for Applied Mathematics Computer Science, Engineering, and Biology and Chemistry respectively.  A private liberal arts institution, located in Charlotte, North Carolina, JCSU ranks in the top 15 among Historically Black Colleges and Universities and continues to motivate students to purse careers in the scientific enterprise.  Although faculty engage in research activities, undergraduate research is an integral focus of the training program at JCSU.  Seniors are required to undertake a research project leading to the publication of an investigative paper in the Undergraduate Journal of Research. The University has expressed its commitment to the sciences by providing the resources for the construction of a new science and technology center that will be adjoined to Davis Hall,  a 72 year old science facility.  Currently all science is conducted in Davis and Perry Halls.  However over the past years, programs in Computer Science and Engineering have had to compete with Biology  and Chemistry for dedicated space to conduct research and research training activities.   Due to multi-use of laboratory space, research is limited for practical and safety reasons.  Laboratories are inadquate to support various research activities and lack the proper infrastructural utilities needed.    The NSF project will consist of replacing research and research training space assigned to computer science, mathematics, and engineering in Davis Hall, and the renovation of selected chemistry and biology  laboratories in Davis and Perry Halls. The modernization will include upgrading, HVAC, electrical, and plumbing systems, installation of fume hoods, cabinetry, counters and computer cabling.  The project will provide enhanced research space for faculty, and will allow for the expansion of research capabilities,  accommodating  more undergraduate and high school students from the city  interested in science and technology issues.",
