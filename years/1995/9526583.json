Critical parameters of particular relevance to kinetic phenomena, the spacing(wavelength), amplitude and stress dependence of this interfacial instability will be determined.  Additionally, computer simulation and modeling will be utilized as an integral part of the research to better analyze experimental results and gain further understanding and insight into the mechanistic details of interfacial roughening. %%%  This project will explore a new and innovative approach achieve better fundamental understanding of kinetic phenomena of critical importance to the synthesis and processing of advanced electronic and photonic materials.  The proposed research has potential for high pay-off to a broad range of experimental and theoretical data accumulated to date, and several key issues can be appropriately addressed and resolved by the project to provide greater understanding and insight to atomic level processes of significance to advancing the field of microelectronics. Additionally, an important feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
