 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415684  Cruz       The goal of this project is to develop new methods to  efficiently predict and control the quality of service seen by  heterogeneous users in an integrated services network. This is  critical to the development of efficient and economically viable  large scale high speed networks.  Statistical sharing can be used  to gain efficiency, but it introduces uncertainties in the quality  of service seen by users of a network.       Since the uncertainty that arises with statistical sharing is  primarily due to queueing phenomena, this will be our main focus.  Thus, one may view our project as a study on the behavior and  control of queueing networks.  Viewed in this larger context, our  work will have an impact in other vitally important research areas,  such as flexible manufacturing networks and transportation  networks. We will, however, be primarily motivated by issues  which arise in a communication context.       We will develop techniques for examining end-to-end  performance issues, and examine mechanisms for the allocation and  scheduling of resources. One emphasis will be on uncovering  mathematical structure of sample paths. This will have an impact on  the utility of performance analyses involving both stochastic and  non-stochastic models. The issues being examined are critical to  the design of economical large scale high speed networks.  ***",
