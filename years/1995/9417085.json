 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417085  Pang    This award supports a three-year cooperative research project between  Dr. Jong-Shi Pang of the Johns Hopkins University and Professor  Masao Fukushima of the Nara Institute of Science and Technology.   The collaborators will investigate various iterative methods for  solving finite-dimensional variational inequalities and  complementarity problems that arise from engineering and science  applications and to gain a solid understanding of the relative strengths  and weaknesses of these methods.  Important issues pertaining to the  variational inequalities and complementarity problems that are deemed  relevant to the design, analysis, and implementation of the iterative  methods will also be studied.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries  working in the area of variational inequalities and complementarity  problems.  By joining forces and combining resources,  Drs. Pang and  Fukushima will solidify their research efforts, strengthen their  individual research programs, expand the scope of applications of the  results, and establish a solid base for further collaborations between  the two host institutions. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
