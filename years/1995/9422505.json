 "awd_abstract_narration": "SBR-9422505  Paul Ruud and Daniel McFadden    The use of advanced statistical and econometric techniques by economists doing   empirical research has always been constrained by the computational resources   available to them.  For example, until the invention of the PC about twelve years    ago, most economists were limited by the limited availability and high cost of   mainframe computers to using ordinary least squares.  In recent years the   computational power available to most economists has grown so rapidly that the   econometric techniques that are computationally feasible have advanced well   beyond the ones used in day to day research by most practicing economists and   taught to most cmllege students.  There is a growing need to bring the many   newly feasible econometric methods to the attention of applied researchers.    Such dissemination is the purpose of this set of conferences on innovations in   statistical and econometric computation.  These conferences will provide a focal   point for the dissemination of research, for the closer interaction of researchers in   statistics and econometrics, for the demonstration of state-of-the-art software,   and for instruction of graduate students.    These conferences have three objectives.  The first objective is to bring together   statisticians and econometricians.  Statisticians can learn of the methodological   and computational problems facing econometricians and econometricians can   learn of new methods developed by statisticians.  The second objective it to   foster the development of new computational algorithms.  This is done through   \"hands-on\" demonstrations of new computational methods by those who have   invented them.  The third objective is to introduce graduate students and junior   faculty to the statistical and econometric community.  The relatively small size of   the conferences creates an intimate atmosphere conducive to lively interaction.",
