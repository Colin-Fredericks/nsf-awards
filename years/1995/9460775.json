 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the development of Pockels transverse type UV modulators from E-O materials of the borate family. The half-wave voltage decreases as the wavelength is decreased and the length is increased. It is proposed to demonstrate a UV modulator with a half-wave voltage of less than 1000 volts at 266nm. UV modulators are required for high density information storage and retrieval with high resolution. Quantum Technology (QT) proposes in Phase I to investigate new members of the borate family, namely Lead Tetraborate (PBO) and Strontium Tetraborate (SBO). These materials were grown for the first time by Prof. Bruce Chai of the University of Central Florida Center of Research and Education in Optics and Lasers (CREOL). These materials have the potential as UV modulators because of their basic properties:  (1) UV transmission down to 130nm (SBO) and 280nm (PBO); (2) high refractive index; (3) not soluble in water; (4) growth characteristics of congruent melt, which enables them to be grown by Czochralski method; and (5) low piezo-electric resonance, typical of the borate family. Large crystals, 8 x 40 x 120nm3, were grown in seven days. The current growth process is not fully optimized. In the Phase I proposal, QT will investigate the electro-optic coefficients rc1 and rc2  and measure the parameters of PBO/SBO as a transverse E-O amplitude modulator in the UV.",
