 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support from this grant will help to defray the expenses of US scholars to travel to Leuven, Belgium to attend the July 19-23 meeting of the International Society for the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology (ISHPSSB).  This meeting, the seventh biennial meeting of the society, is the first meeting of the society to be held outside North America.    ISHPSSB has come in the course of its twelve year history to be the primary setting for historians, philosophers and social scientists of biology to interact with one another and with practicing biologists on issues of common, professional interest.  Past meetings of the society have been highly stimulating and fruitful.  Invaluable scholarly contacts and interchanges have developed from conference sessions.  1995 is a propitious time for this society to hold its first European meeting given that  25% of the participants at previous meetings have been coming from outside North America; that significant work in these fields is advancing apace at various European centers; and that the last several years have witnessed new national societies established in Europe for the study of biology from historical, philosophical and social scientific perspectives.    These travel funds are being used to assist graduate students and independent scholars in attending the 1995 meeting.  Funding is being limited to those with official participation in the program:  presenting papers, delivering commentaries, and/or chairing sessions.  Grant recipients are being selected by a travel grants award committee.  Grants are being administered through the History of Science Society.",
