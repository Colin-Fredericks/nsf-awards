 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project extends transaction cost theory to decisions  regarding inter-firm research and development services in  the particular context of software development.  The  research is supported under the Joint NSF/Private Sector  Initiative and involves a collaborative effort between  twenty-one private-sector organizations and the principal  investigators.  The objective of the study is to test  important questions benchmarking sourcing procedures for  software development.  This project's model of sourcing  decisions and outcomes is richer than those usually found in  research on vertical integration.  No other study has  examined both the sourcing decision and supplier performance  separately, although there are strong theoretical reasons  why this design is advisable.  The design enables conceptual  distinctions to be made between important questions.  Also,  the data are not subject to the usual problems of hindsight  measurement bias or to difficulties in attributing  causality.  The model for this research is grounded in  problems of software sourcing that the cooperating  organizations currently face.  The resources dedicated to  choosing and managing new developers have been rapidly  increasing in recent years.  The results of this study  should lead to new approaches to solving sourcing problems  more generally in a world of inter-firm reliance and  cooperation.  Thus, although the projects is based in  theory, it has strong operational component.  This project  will help both the cooperating organizations and academic  researchers learn how to initiate and carry out this kind of  research partnership.",
