 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective  of this   RUI project is to design ``smarter` algorithms that  avoid memory  access conflicts without significant slowdown of an  algorithm's performance.  In particular, this research focuses on  designing such algorithms (especially  for graph problems),  studying their characteristics, developing methodologies,  and  evaluating the gains from removal of concurrent memory access.    The  methods studied which, when carefully employed by a parallel algorithm, avoid  concurrent memory access.  Methods, which have  been shown to be effective on  parallel graph algorithms and which are also being investigated, include:  (1) pseudotree contraction, a set of rules that allows a pseudotree to  be contracted to a rooted star in logarithmic time without  concurrent-writing access; (2) edge-list augmentation, a  procedure that runs in constant time without any concurrent memory  access; (3) growth-control scheduling, a method of balancing   the work performed by clusters of processors so that the  total amount of time needed to finish a job is minimized.",
