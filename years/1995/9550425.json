 "awd_abstract_narration": "The solution phase chemistry of SO2 its reaction with water and  other atmospheric constituents, is recognized as a major source of  acid rain.  Many of the good oxidizing agents formed by gas-phase  chemistry in the troposphere, such as O3 and H2O2, do not react  with SO2 at a measurable rate unless dissolved in an aqueous  environment.  A combinatimn of spectroscopic techniques will be  used to locate and characterize the electronic energy levels of SO2  in the condensed phase.  Intramolecular relaxation following the  photoexcitation of SO2 and the rates of product formation will be  examined using transient Raman spectroscopy at the University of  Rochester and Photoacoustic Calorimetry (PAC) at the University of  Pittsburgh.    International activities include:  developing a graduate-level  course, Lasers in Chemistry; and initiating a graduate women's  seminar series in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon and Duquesne  Universities which will include a formal time for undergraduates to  present their research.",
