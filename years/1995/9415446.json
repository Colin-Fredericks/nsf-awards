Cognitive Neural Network Models that Bridge Levels of Abstraction          This  is  the first year funding of a three year continuing  award  on  neural  net  models of cognition.   Such  models  must  provide  architectures  capable  both  of  representing  a  given  situation  at  different levels of abstraction and of  supporting  the  flow  of  information between these  levels.   This  project  explores  cognitive  neural  models that  can  bridge  levels  of  abstraction,  by developing a connectionist model  of  the  well-  known   cognitive  phenomenon  of  illusory  contour   perception  (perception of non-existent contour lines at boundaries of a non-  existent  occluding object inferred from context).  The model  of  illusory contour perception will allow top-down feedback from the  perception  of  an  occluding object to cause the  perception  of  illusory  contrast along the object's boundary.  The  model  will  explicitly  incorporate a representational  hierarchy  of  visual  elements  at multiple levels of abstraction.  Simulation  results  using the model will show how feedforward activation leads to the  perception of the occluded object at a high level of abstraction,  and  how feedback activates the units that represent the illusory  contrast.   The  architecture of the model  suggests  a  testable  prediction   about  human  perception  of  subjective   contours,  providing clues to certain mysteries of visual perception.",
