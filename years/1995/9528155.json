 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528155  Freeman   This proposal examines the ability of wind-pollinated plants to respond to pollen deprivation in an evolutionary adaptive manner, and to determine if maternal parents, subject to delayed pollination, influence their progeny's sex ratio and male reproductive potential.  There is a increasing evidence that wind-pollinated plants can determine if they have been pollinated  and respond to delays in pollination in a manner that increases the likelihood of their being pollinated by increasing either the number or length of their stigmas (i.e., increasing the total pollen capture surface area).  The delay in pollination is also reported to influence progeny sex ratio, and enhance the production of stamens by the male progeny in cultivated spinach.    We propose to examine the impact of delayed pollination and inadequate pollination on characteristics of both the maternal parent (the number of pistillate flowers, and stigma length)  and their progeny (sex ratio, and fitness) using Atriplex powellii (an annual) and A. garrettii (a short lived perennial).  Both species are wind pollinated, and grow in the cold deserts of  North America.  From a theoretical perspective the studies will add to our understanding of  factors that influence sex ratios, and the ability of plants to respond to dynamic aspects of their environment.  From a practical perspective the experiments will provide useful information about the reproductive biology of wind-pollinated plants under conditions of reduced population density.",
