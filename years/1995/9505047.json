 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowles       The investigator studies parameter identification inverse  problems.  Typically, in such a problem one uses certain given  information about the solution of a partial differential equation  to compute one or more of the coefficients in the equation.  Such  problems are invariably ill-posed (sometimes badly so) and, to  make matters worse, in processing the data in most practical  applications, one must contend not only with measurement error but  sometimes also with the fact that the readings may only be taken  at a rather sparse collection of measurement points.  In  consequence, in many areas, it is well documented that algorithms  for parameter identification that are sufficiently reliable to  engender widespread practical use are not yet available.  In this  project the investigator develops a new approach to a broad class  of parameter identification problems.  At the core of the approach  is the Dirichlet principle for elliptic boundary value problems,  that the solution may be obtained by the minimization of a certain  energy functional; that the same energy functional can also be  used to compute coefficients in the elliptic equation, if an  appropriate constrained minimization is employed, is the key  observation.  Recent experiments have shown that the same numerical  stability that is associated with the Dirichlet principle approach  to finding solutions is also present in the constrained  minimization, and furthermore the method appears to be quite  robust in the presence of noise in the data.  The class of  parameter identification problems to which the approach is  applicable is, roughly speaking, those that involve elliptic  equations that may be solved by means of a Dirichlet principle; as  is well known, this is a large class, having considerable  practical significance.  The bulk of the work in the project  involves applying these ideas to producing working algorithms for  the solution of the aquifer transmissivity problem (a crucial step  in the modeling of under ground water systems) and the problem of  imaging inside the human body with electrical impedance  tomography.       Inverse problems dealing with parameter identification in the  presence of data error are of fundamental practical importance in  a number of areas, including, but by no means limited to, medical  and industrial imaging, high energy physics, geophysics, and  hydrology.  Such problems are mathematically ill-posed in the sense  that small variations in the data (caused by measurement error for  example) can cause uncontrollably large errors to appear in the  calculated parameters.  In this proposal a new optimization  approach to a broad class of parameter identification problems is  presented that already shows significant promise for handling the  moderately ill-posed problems in this class, and there are  indications that such an approach may help solve the most  egregiously ill-posed examples.  The project concentrates on two  test cases, the aquifer transmissivity problem (a necessary and  crucial step in monitoring the flow of contaminants in underground  water systems, for example) and the problem of (noninvasive and  nondestructive) imaging inside the human body using electrical  impedance tomography.  If suitably effective algorithms can be  developed with these ideas in the test cases, similar algorithms  should be possible for a wide range of related applications in the  areas outlined above, and elsewhere.",
