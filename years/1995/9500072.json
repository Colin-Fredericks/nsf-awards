 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500072  Costa  Over the last several decades many populations of pinnipeds and  seabirds have undergone significant declines.  Many hypotheses to  explain the declines have been made and numerous studies have  been undertaken to search for the underlying causes.  Juvenile  survival, however, may be one of the most critical factors  influencing the growth and recovery of depleted populations of  pinnipeds.  Maternal resources imparted to offspring prior to  weaning are important for a successful transition from  nutritional dependence to independence and subsequent survival.   This may be particularly so of species whose life histories are  constrained by rearing young at high-latitudes and species which  wean their young abruptly.  Growth and recovery of depleted  populations at high-latitudes are further constrained when life-  history fecundity schedules limit individuals to producing one  offspring per year.  Thus, the quantity and quality of maternal  investment to the young are a critical determinant of post-  weaning survival.  This research will examine the relationship  between foraging behavior and maternal investment in northern fur  seals.  The research will be conducted in the Pribilof Islands;  Alaska, where lactating northern fur seals have been shown to  have three distinct foraging patterns (shallow, deep, and mixed).   The location of the Pribilof Islands, near the edge of an  extensive continental shelf, fortuitously gives animals breeding  there two distinct foraging environments, one on the continental  and one off.  Each environment has a distinct assemblage of prey  species.  Previous studies show the deep diving foraging pattern  to be associated with foraging over the continental shelf.  We  will quantify the foraging costs and total investment in pups  associated with the different foraging strategies observed in  northern fur seals.  This will be done by comparing the maternal  investment in terms of both the actual energy and material  delivered to the pup and the ene rgetic cost to the mother.  These  data will be used to determine if one foraging strategy is  energetically more efficient or beneficial and if this is so,  does it allow the mother to make a greater investment in her  young.",
