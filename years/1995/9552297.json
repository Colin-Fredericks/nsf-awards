 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Anthropology's Visual Anthropology Lab (1)  enhances innovative instructional undergraduate training in  representing culture and behavior through visual media and (2)  supports student projects in visual anthropology and other  anthropology labs by providing upgraded facilities for  documenting archaeological sites, observing and recording primate  behavior, recording skeletal remains, and providing visual  materials for museum displays.   Specifically, this project funds  photographic, video, audio, and specialized computer equipment to  support a revised undergraduate Program in Visual Anthropology  that fosters student understanding of filmic and ethnographic  photography, ensures practical competency in film and/or  photographic production, and provides instrumentation for student  projects.   The department expects to renovate existing lab space  vacated by other science departments and establish an integrated  lab facility for all the field of anthropology including  osteology (forensic and primatological), archaeology,  ethnographic analysis, and visual anthropology.   The lab  facilities and equipment are envisioned as an integrated unit,  such that student projects in archaeology, primatology,  osteology, and cultural analysis have access to the Visual  Anthropology Lab facilities and vice versa.",
