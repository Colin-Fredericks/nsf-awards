The cost of design, process modification, quality, maintainability, and disposal are included in this concept.  A standard set of topological cost models for cost-driver activities will be derived accessing a set of relational data base files containing time, cost, and resource requirements.  Utilizing the principles of activity based costing and a knowledge base including all cross-impact and linking cost relationships, a life cycle cost for technological innovation and design changes for both \"as-is\" and \"to-be\" scenarios will be calculated.  Risk analysis, sensitivity analysis of key cost drivers, and the cost of quality will be included.  Three industrial partners will collaborate in this research.        This research may effect a uniform life cycle cost model using a realistic and acceptable allocation of both direct and indirect costs and component models with standardized topology.  The results would provoke a dramatic improvement in the ability of manufacturing firms to estimate the cost of design changes and technological innovation.",
