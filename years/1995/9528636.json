The objective  of the proposed studies is to investigate the structure and  properties of thermoplastic elastomers based upon propylene  homopolymers.  These materials offer an environmentally  attractive alternative to conventional vulcanized  elastomers, but little is known about their properties.  Specific aims are:  (i) to establish the relationship  between molecular structure, solid-state organization, and  physical and mechanical properties, (ii) to prepare a series  of elastomeric polypropylenes with systematic variations in  polymer microstructure, and (iii) to investigate how changes  in the microstructure of elastomeric polypropylenes  influence solid-state structure and organization.  The  experimental approach includes characterization of  elastomeric polypropylene to probe the structure of these  materials over a range of length scales, from  the atomic  length scale (microstructure) to length scales appropriate  for characterizing  isotactic helix lengths, crystallite  dimensions and large scale morphological features.  A  complementary set of experiments will investigate how  changes in microstructure influence the solid state  organization, structure and properties of these materials.  %%%  Thermoplastic elastomeric polypropylene has the properties  of a vulcanized rubber, but the production and processing  advantages of polyolefin thermoplastics.  The development of  this new material should enable the substitution of less  environmentally attractive vulcanized rubbers.  The  environmental benefit of elastomeric polypropylene derives  from the high efficiency in manufacturing, processing, and  recyclability.  The ability to flow upon heating and  solidify on cooling allows manufacturers to produce rubber-  like materials using melt-extruders, blow molders and other  energy-efficient thermoplastic processing equipment.  Expensive, wasteful, and energy-inte nsive compounding and  vulcanizing steps can be avoided and scrap from molded  articles can be re-used.  These materials can be  manufactured with minimal waste to give materials that have  elastomeric properties yet the recycling characteristics of  polyolefins.  Elastomeric polypropylene should be readily  incorporated into normal polypropylene recycling streams.  An important feature of the program is the training of  graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area.  ***",
