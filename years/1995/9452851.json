The curriculum extends and revises existing materials developed  and published by The Math Learning Center.  These materials  include Box It or Bag It Mathematics (grades K-2), Opening Eyes  to Mathematics (grades 3-4), and the Visual Math Course Guides  (grades 5-8).  The later is part of the Math and The Mind's Eye  materials developed with support from NSF.  In addition to  extending and revising these materials, the project prepares an  Overview that provides a synopsis of the curriculum, including  it's philosophical foundations.  The Overview identifies the  major mathematical strands and traces their development through  various parts of the curriculum.  The Overview also contains a  scope and sequence of the series and suggestions for managing  materials, alternate methods of assessment, and appropriate  instructional strategies. The series does not contain a textbook,  but does include printed materials consisting of course guides  and other resources for teachers, suggestions for students'  projects and homework, and blackline masters for student pages.    The defining characteristic of this curriculum is its emphasis on  visual thinking.  The curriculum is designed to improve students'  ability to communicate mathematically, increase their  understanding of mathematical concepts, and improve their  attitudes toward mathematics.  ***",
