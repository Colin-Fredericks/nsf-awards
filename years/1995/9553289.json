 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metekukukiah Pemaenakuaq--Keepers of the Forest Summer Science  Camp--proposes an experiential field-based approach to studying  mathematics and science.  The six-week camp builds-in camper  mentorships during the school year that provides a supportive  network for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade students.  In order to measure  desired outcomes, career pipeline indicators will be used (positive  experiences producing interest, encouragement, and enrollment in  appropriate mathematics and science coursework) so that students  enter post-secondary institutions and begin their careers in  mathematics and science-related fields.     Within the summer camp program, students will experience  mathematics and science in the context of forestry--they will learn  about the Annual Allowable Cut that is used in determining the  amount of timber harvested, and the measurements that are used to  calculate it.  Students will learn to make these measurements  themselves including DBH (diameter-at-breast-height), volume, and  height.  During their research projects, students will be using  measurements of tree diameter, height, and basal area either in the  comparison of forestry tools, or in the change of the measured  plots over time.    Mentoring systems are created during the camp session where  students and adults (forestry professionals and elder in the  community who have valuable experience and knowledge regarding the  forest, traditions, and necessity of sharing that knowledge) meet,  and discuss sustained yield forestry principles and its application  to global sustained development.  Follow-up activities after the  camp include:  Menominee Tribal Enterprise mill tours where  cooperating teachers have students conduct career interviews; trips  to the Menominee Logging Museum where the museum curator conducts  \"hands-on\" experiences using technology from the past; scheduled  visits to the College of Menominee to hear speakers within the  field of forestry; visits to larger campuses that offer bachelor's  degree s in forestry (student work on computers in the library where  information is obtained electronically); participation in career  day with focus enthusiasm and vigor; conduct presentations using  their own written pieces about research projects, using graphs and  charts to provide basis for decision-making about forestry  practices; and cooperate in project evaluation and students  assessment activities.    Evaluations are on-going and two-fold.  First of all, the project  activities planned will be evaluated by an external evaluator to  monitor program activities--effectiveness of planning meetings,  recruitment and retention strategies, camp activities, and follow-  up activities in student's own school in the community, on college  campuses, or in the forest.  Second, student assessment will entail  how students feel about the project in terms of its usefulness and  how it builds their self-confidence to enter the educational  pipeline via activity (experience), coursework, and career  planning.  Students will be monitored regarding school attendance,  enrollment in mathematics and science coursework, advanced  mathematics and science coursework, keeping tabs on oneself to seek  as much career information as they can (contacts and trips), and  providing information via public presentations.  In the long run,  students can monitor their own improved sense of usefulness and  self-confidence in mathematics and science because of planned  entrance and exit interviews.  Furthermore, they can build positive  experience during the camp and later with the mentorship systems  that provide a supportive network.  For monitoring the success of  the program beyond and outside evaluator's report, project staff--  guided by pertinent timelines--will have opportunities to adjust  plans through continuous meetings, but will know what outcomes have  been achieved through actual presentations made by the students.   The staff will also be involved in various dissemination activities  to share knowledge gained fr om participation in this program.  ***",
