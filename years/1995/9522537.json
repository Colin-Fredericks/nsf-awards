 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522537  Arnow     This project incorporates advances in distributed processing research into the entire undergraduate computer science (CS) curriculum, starting from CS 1. This involves constructing a vertical integration of this new programming methodology. As a result, (1) every student in CS will be acquainted with distributed processing; (2) students will have time to absorb key ideas introduced in elementary courses and these ideas will be reinforced in advanced courses; (3) the theory and techniques of distributed computing can be presented as the students' readiness permits and as appropriate applications are encountered in the curriculum.     At the outset, short modules addressing distributed computing issues will be incorporated into the two beginning programming courses. Subsequently, additional modules will be included in the discrete mathematics course, the shell programming course, and the operating systems course. Advanced courses will integrate distributed computing as part of the student's standard CS toolkit. Special topics courses, oriented towards challenging applications, will be revised to exploit the students' training.     In the third year of this effort, a faculty development workshop for CS faculty from around the country will be organized in order to disseminate the results of this effort.  ***",
