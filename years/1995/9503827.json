 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503827  Pan    This award supports the collaboration of Dr. Austin Pan,  School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University and Mr.  Mitsuo Miyazaki, Sumitomo Construction Company, Tokyo,  Japan.  Project funding will enable Dr. Pan to spend six  months in Japan, resident at the Sumitomo Construction  Company, in order to learn about viscous-damping walls from  the inventor of this technology, Mr. Miyazaki.  Working  together, they will share their knowledge and experience to  expedite the development of viscous-damping walls and its  application for earthquake resistant construction.    This project brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of earthquake engineering. The  U. S. scientist will have the opportunity to become familiar  with research techniques, equipment, and facilities at  Sumitomo Construction Company while contributing to the  overall research effort. This collaboration will not only be  mutually beneficial to the U.S. and Japan, it will also  benefit all countries where earthquakes offer a prevailing  threat.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of  the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
