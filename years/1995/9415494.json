 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for, \"Experimentally Probing the Unknowns  of Sonoluminescence\".  Sonoluminescence is the emission of  visible radiation from cavitation bubbles of gas produced in  a liquid by standing sound waves.  The bubbles are trapped  at nodes of the standing sound waves and at high intensity  the pulsations of the bubble with pressure oscillations of  the sound wave are large enough to prevent the bubble from  dissolving into the surrounding liquid.  At higher levels of  sound, a threshold is reached at which the bubble motion  abruptly switches to a state where pulsations are so  enormous and nonlinear that the resulting supersonic inward  collapse of the bubble concentrates the acoustic energy by  over 13 orders of magnitude, so as to emit picosecond  flashes of broad band light which extend well into the  ultraviolet and which, furthermore, are synchronous with the  sound field to picosecond accuracy.  This phenomena is not  understood but it has been shown to have large effects in  catalyzing some chemical processing, in causing erosion of  hardened metal surfaces and possibly in forming new  materials.",
