 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420558  Holl    This research is focused on developing a better understanding  of  the atomic scale structure of the silicon/silicon oxide interface  and  the  chemical  reactions which occur at this  interface.  To  accomplish   these  goals,  methods  are  developed  for   making  silicon/silicon  oxide  interfaces of well-defined  structure  to  serve  as  model  spectroscopic  systems.  The  model  interfaces  synthesized   provide  excellent  test  systems   for   crHically  examining  the assumptions and assignments used when interpreting  data  collected  from  standard  themmal  oxide  interfaces,   an  essential   component  of  most  microelectronic   devices.   The  interfaces  being  synthesized  are  also  interesting  from  the  perspective  of  a  priori control of solid structure.  Synthetic  methods are proposed which allow chemical tuning of the interface  and formation of metastable thin films of silicon oxide. Analysis  of  the  stepwise  formation  of a  film  using  surface  science  techniques  avoids  a  common  problem  of  precursor  to  solids  chemistry,  obtaining meaningful analytical data from  the  solid  formed.  %%%  The  interface between crystalline and amorphous silicon  dioxide  plays a critical role in microelectronic devices and has been the  subject  of  intense  research for over  40  years.  Advances  in  information  and communications have been directly  coupled  with  the  development  of better methods of materials preparation.  As  silicon  oxide film dimensions shrink from about 1000  to  50-100   A,  design and understanding of the composition of the interface  layer becomes of critical importance. This research is focused on  developing  a better understanding of the atomic scale  structure  of the silicon/silicon oxide interface and the chemical reactions  which occur at this interface.",
