It  appears  that a consistent picture of the responses, from microwave to infrared  is finally emerging. However, the understanding that has been achieved  is  largely  confined  to zero magnetic field. The  proposed  research  seeks  to develop a thorough understanding of the optical response  in  the  vortex-state  which arises in response to  magnetic  field.   The  study  focuses on the terahertz frequency range, which is the  crucial  one  for vortex dynamics in the cuprates because it corresponds to the  gap  for  quasi  particle  excitations in the  vortex  core.  The  key  experimental tool is terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, which is  the  most successful approach to measuring broad band response of the media  in  the spectral range between the microwave and infra-red domains. In  this  technique the complex response function is measured directly  by  resolving   the   transmission  coefficient   of   nearly-single-cycle  picosecond  electric  field pulses. These  pulses  are  generated  and  detected  optoelectronically through the use of  a  femtosecond  mode-  locked laser.  %%%    The spectacular property of superconductors is the vanishing of the dc  resistance.  However,  above zero frequency,  superconductors  develop  measurable  resistance, whose properties are a distinguishing  feature  of  superconductivity in different materials. The resistivity of  high  temperature  cuprate superconductors in zero applied  magnetic  field,  from  microwave to visible frequencies, has been studied  intensively.  This   project  investigates  the  fundamentally  and  technologically  important  regime  of  under magnetic field.  The  proposal  seeks  to  develop   a   thorough  understanding  of  the  response  of   cuprate  superconductors in the \"vortex state\" which arises in the presence  of  large magnetic field. The research focus es on the terahertz region  of  the spectrum, which is the crucial range for the cuprates, and uses  a  powerful new spectroscopic tool, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. A  broad   range   of   high  quality  films  will  be  synthesized   and  investigated  . The results will test and stimulate theoretical  work,  which  is  evolving  rapidly  as evidence emerges  for  unconventional  origins of superconductivity in HTS.  ***",
