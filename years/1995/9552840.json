The plan is for the three districts to develop a professional development infrastructure.  The communities are diverse, consisting of the blue collar community, professionals, and many socioeconomic groups.    The focus of the planning and the core of the work is to create  an infrastructure that directly enables and suppmrts the vision, to share resources, and serves all teachers K-12.  The project will plan a program of collaborative strategic action to address the needs identified.  The collaborative will:     identify existing capacities, connections, services and resources:   maximize existing human and institutional capacities, connections, service and resources; and   create and find new capacities, connections, services and resources.    The project will work closely with Maine's SSI, using the SSI's science and mathematics curriculum framework.  A cross-district inquiry approach to planning will be used which will build on the prior initiative of the Maine Center for Educational Services.  Educational technology will be an important tool for those involved in the project.  Educators in all three sites will be able to send and receive email, connect with MaineNet information services, and communicate with Internet users world-wide through the use of MaineNet's statewide electronic information network.  Cost sharing will be 80%  The project requested $50,000 from NSF.   ***",
