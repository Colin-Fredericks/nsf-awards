 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project to combine Technology, Economics, Active learning,  and Mathematics (TEAM) integrates introductory economics with the  mathematics needed for economics.   The focus is on an active,  cooperative learning approach in which instruction in basic  economics is fully integrated with those mathematical topics  needed for understanding of economic concepts.   Twenty selected  College of Business freshmen explore, in a computer laboratory  setting and under the direction of the principal investigators,  major concepts of economics and apply suitable mathematical  tools.   They strengthen their understanding of the role of  mathematics in business and industry and broaden their  understanding of basic economics, and they present their findings  in a series of research reports.   TEAM meets daily in laboratory  and group problem-solving sessions to investigate a series of  economics questions and to learn to employ the mathematical and  computer methods required for their solution.   TEAM covers the  material normally presented in two semesters of introductory  economics as well as two required mathematics courses involving  fundamentals of calculus, the mathematics of finance, and  introductory statistics.",
