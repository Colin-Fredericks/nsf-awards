 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to assist in the purchase of a Confocal  Laser Scanning Microscope System (CLSM). The enormous and rapidly  expanding battery of antibodies and of other fluorescent probes has  opened the way to a greatly expanded use of fluorescent microscopy.  Unfortunately, the thickness and light scattering occurring in many  biological specimens seriously compromises the sensitivity, clarity and  resolution of even the best epi-fluorescent images. CLSM overcomes  these limitations and produces images of great clarity. This  instrumentation will serve the needs of biological scientists at the  University of Wyoming (UW) whose work focuses on cell architecture and  cellular dynamics, organelle structures and their spatial and temporal  relationships and the localizations/functions of cell and tissue  antigens. The proposal is submitted by a major user group representing  four UW departments: Botany, Molecular Biology, Psychology, and Zoology  and Physiology. The system will be available to all UW researchers who  have legitimate needs and will operate as a bona fide University  instrumentation center. The acquisition of this state-of-the-art  instrumentation and the establishment of a CLSM center will offer  investigators the opportunity to remain competitive in cell/molecular  biology and neuroscience, foster research collaborations and provide  training for both undergraduate and graduate students.       The CLSM system will initially be used in support of the following  projects: Chromosomal Studies in Bromeliaceae (G. Brown, Botany), The  Role of Bombesin-like Peptides in Neural Physiology (F. Flynn,  Psychology), Applications of Confocal Laser Microscopy to Research on  Nuclear Phenomena in Ciliate Protozoa (R. Jenkins, Zoology), Probing  Plant-Fungal Interactions: The Form and Physiology of Ectomycorrhizal  Fungal Linkages with Plant Roots (S. Miller, Botany), Effects of Heat  on Development: Use of the Confocal Microscope to Follow Assembly of  Actin Fibers and Localizati on of Integrins Following Heat Shock (N.  Petersen, Molecular Biology), Applications of Confocal Microscopy to  Research in Behavioral Neuroendocrinology (J. Rose, Psychology),  Confocal Microscopy in Studies of DNA Escape from Mitochondria to the  Nucleus (P. Thorsness, Molecular Biology), Laser Confocal Microscopy in  Studies of Leaf Structure Function: Do Epidermal Lens Cells Play a Role  in Photosynthesis? (T. Vogelmann, Botany).       In addition, the CLSM system will be used as a teaching tool within  laboratory based courses within the four departments as well as for  closely supervised graduate and undergraduate research. The total  project cost is $253,710 of which the University of Wyoming has pledged  a 49% match.            NSF FORM 1358 (1/94)    3",
