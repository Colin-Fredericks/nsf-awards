 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523022  Dzenis   The objective of this project is a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of the process of electrospinning polymer solutions and melts into fibers.  Electrospinning makes it possible to spin very thin polymer fibers, with diameters as small as 1/100 the diameter of ordinary textile fibers, that is about 50 nanometers.  Such fibers are not readily available now.  This research will provide a scientific background for the development of experimental methods and devices to control the geometrical parameters, microstructure, and properties of fibers that can be produced economically.  This project will be carrier out at two universities.  One will concentrate on electromechanical models of the process, on the evaluation of fiber mechanical properties, on the electromechanical control of the placement of the fibers into useful patterns, and in the mechanical analysis of structures created with these fine, nanoscale fibers.  The other university will design and build improved electrospinning apparatus, collect data to improve the modeling of the process, measure diameters, shapes and molecular orientation in individual fibers using scanning probe and electron microscopy, select polymers to be spun, demonstrate successful spinning in air, other gases and vacuum.  Process modifications needed for spinning in special environments, such as would be encountered in applying pesticides to plants, or creating structures in space will be explored.  A number of unique phenomena, such as fiber splaying, acceleration of the jet by an alternating field, multiple jet interaction, and electrical means of fiber placement will be analyzed for the first time.  Experimental and theoretical data generated will constitute a fundamental basis for the future integrated manufacturing technologies combining fiber spinning with an automated fabrication of three dimensional fiber assemblies.  Both universities will be involved in educating students and transferring information developed in this proj ect to industrial, agricultural, space communications, or other areas where it can be used.   The interest in thin polymer fibers is broad.  Potential applications include improved reinforced composites; a substrate for catalysts and enzymes; a new way to place pesticide to plants; improve textiles; and advanced filters.  More exotic applications include solar sails for propulsion in space, large space antennas, reflecting lenses and mirrors, and others.  This research is part of a broader effort to understand and exploit the uniqueness of nanoscale technologies.",
