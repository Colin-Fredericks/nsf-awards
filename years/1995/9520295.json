 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520295  Wright  This research project will  investigate the seismic response of  exterior frame connections in  composite (steel-concrete)  structures.  The connections will  consist of  a steel-reinforced  concrete (SRC) column and a  composite beam (steel beam and  concrete slab).  Transverse steel  beams, steel decking and a floor  slab will all be part of the test  subassemblies to more closely  simulate composite connections as  they would be constructed in the  field.  The primary experimental  variables will be the moment  strength ratio between the SRC  column and the composite beam, and  the type of confinement  reinforcement used in the SRC  column in the joint region of the  connection subassembly.  Within the  joint perimeter hoop reinforcement  will need to be composed of as many  as four pieces that are lap spliced  as they pass through the steel beam  webs.  For some of the specimens a  fiber reinforced concrete (FRC)  will be used in the connection  region to enhance the bond along  the splice lengths.  The FRC will  add some internal confinement to  the concrete in the connection and  should slow the deterioration of  the concrete shear mechanisms in  the connection.    Post test analytical studies will  be used to simulate the measured  connection behavior and to help  develop an analytical model that  could be  used for further  parametric studies.  The analytical  modeling will be coordinated with  prior and current U.S. research  projects concerned with modeling  the dynamic response of  composite  frame structures.    This is a project supported under  the year 1 program of the Civil  Infrastructure Systems (CIS),  solicitation NSF 94-154.  ***",
