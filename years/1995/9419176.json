Specifically we will address: 1) the timing and  magnitude of the apparent warming trend associated with the \"melt  water pulse\" immediately preceding the Younger Dryas event, as well  as apparent earlier higher frequency cooling events, to date only  known from ice core records: 2) the absolute temperature of near  surface tropical ocean waters during the period from about 10-14ka  (radiocarbon age); and 3) to what degree the very high frequency  (2,5,11,22 and 83yr) climate signals may be recorded in these  tropical marine cements.  The use of inorganic carbonate cements to determine paleo-  oceanographic and paleoclimatic changes provides an opportunity to  increase both the accuracy of the isotopic record derived from  marine skeletal material, as well as to increase the resolution of  high-frequency changes in the tropical oceans.  These cements  provide a continuous record of isotopic changes on a decadal and  possibly higher frequency scale, over time periods of several  hundreds of years.  This degree of resolution has not been possible  with the currently available marine skeletal records, and provides  a unique opportunity to compare and possibly correlate the high-  frequency climatic events in the tropical oceans with those  recently documented in the ice core data.  Preliminary work has established that our present sample set  contains cements that range in age from 10.9-13.6ka  (AMS 14C),  that  the cements grew at average  rates of approximately 1mm/10yr, and  that the cements    grew for periods of approximately 50-500 years.    Because of the long-lived nature of the cements, many of the  samples overlap in time.  Isotopically the cements exhibit a strong  depletion trend in  18O over this time interval that  correlates  well with those values reported fo r the marine skeletal records.   In addition, because of the decadal to century scale record within  individual cements, there is strong evidence that the cements are  recording high-frequency isotopic fluctuations in the tropical  oceans.  Our present data set shows a strong correlation in both  the timing and magnitude of the isotopic shift as reported for the  \"melt-water pulse\" immediately preceding the Younger Dryas cooling  event as well as evidence for other higher frequency shifts to  cooler conditions that to date has only been reported in ice cores.  This proposal requests funds to expand upon our preliminary  findings by doing high density AMS 14C sampling transects combined  with microsampled (100 um scale) isotopic analysis on these  individual cements to evaluate these high-frequency isotopic shifts  in the tropical oceans. We anticipate being able to document  changes on at least a decadal scale, and possibly at a higher  resolution, due to the continuous and overlapping record of the  individual cements.  This data should increase both the accuracy  and resolution of the isotopic records in tropical oceans, and have  direct impact on our understanding of rapid climate change and the  potential for high latitude shift to be carried over into the  tropics",
