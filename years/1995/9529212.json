 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529212  BROWN       As a participating agency in the Committee on Environment  and Natural Resources (CENR) of the National Science and  Technology Council (NSTC), the National Science Foundation is  committed to bearing its share of collective responsibilities.  In order to provide long-term assistance in overall program  direction, quality, balance, and priorities as well as special  analyses and assistance, CENR has entered into an agreement with  the National Research Council's Board of Sustainable Development  (NRC/BSD).  This agreement is supported through a task-order  contract administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA).  This interagency agreement transferring  funds from NSF to NOAA provides $10,000 toward NSF's $25,000  FY 1995 contribution for support of the CENR-related activities  of the NRC/BSD.  (The remaining $15,000 are being handled through  a separate financial agreement.)       Through this transfer of funds, NSF is fulfilling its  responsibilities to share in the establishment of an effective  mechanism for the broader research community to work with CENR  agencies through the activities of the NRC/BSD.  These activities  will help strengthen programs at NSF and other federal agencies,  and they will facilitate efficient and effective use of  government funds.",
