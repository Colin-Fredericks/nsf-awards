 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central purpose of this project is to enhance minority  undergraduate faculty education in the areas of robotics and  machine vision.  This purpose is achieved by conducting an  intensive training workshop on these topics for computer science  faculty members selected from historically minority universities.    In particular, we propose to conduct an intensive, two-week long  training workshop, along with certain follow-up activities, for 15  computer science faculty members selected from minority  institutions.  Workshop participants are exposed to up-to-date  topics in computer vision and robotics.  The activities  include  direct interaction by Robotics Research Laboratory's faculty and  extensive use of the RRL's research equipment.  Also, participants  are encouraged to take part in individual and group research  projects based on current RRL research efforts.    The final day of the workshop includes a brainstorming discussion  of how the information learned in the workshop will be transferred  into their curriculum.  The results of the workshop will be  published in a refereed journal.",
