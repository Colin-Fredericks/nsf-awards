The focus of this project is on simplex algorithms, interior   point algorithms and algorithms that combine interior point and   multiplier penalty approaches, with particular emphasis on algorithms   that are efficient both in theory and in practice.  Specialized   algorithms for network flow problems and those that take advantage of   the architecture of massively parallel computers will be developed.      Since many problems in science and engineering can be formulated as   large-scale optimization problems, the development of efficient   optimization algorithms under this project will have an impact on fields   outside of optimization such as manufacturing (production planning and   scheduling), biotechnology (protein folding), civil infrastructure (fleet   and crew scheduling and transportation planning), and telecommunications   (network design and routing) as well as on the field of optimization itself.",
