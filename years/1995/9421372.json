 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421372  Zoran  How complex patterns of synaptic connections are formed during  nervous system development and regeneration is a fundamental  concern of neuroscience.  Developing neurons must make a series of  choices, including the differential recognition of appropriate and  inappropriate pathways and targets, that result in highly  stereotyped patterns of connectivity.  Once a growth cone at the  tip of a neuronal process arrives at its appropriate target region,  it forms potential synaptic contacts and initiates synapse  formation.  The idea that growth cones derive specific recognition  signals from targets and that these signals regulate decisions of  synaptic target choice has been considered for some time; however,  the molecular nature of these target-derived cues and the  mechanisms of their presynaptic transduction remain largely  undefined.  Cell-cell interactions, between neurons and their  synaptic partners, govern critical steps in the formation of  synaptic connections during nervous system development and  regeneration.  This project will focus on early inductive events  that govern the acquisition of presynaptic secretory function  during the selective synapse formation of identified motor neurons  in cell culture.  Motor neurons,gain the ability to release  neurotransmitter only following contact with their appropriate  muscle targets.  A major goal of these studies is to determine the  cellular mechanisms governing these inductive events.  Neurons make  a series of choices, including pathway and target selections,  during development that result in highly stereotyped patterns of  connectivity.  These selection processes likely involve the  differential recognition of appropriate pathways and targets.  This  work will provide insights into the molecular nature of retrograde  synaptic signals, the cellular basis of synaptic target  discrimination, and the role of cellular processes in the  development of synaptic specificity.",
