 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523323  El-Sharkawi    Using twin signal signature sensing, we propose a method to  monitor, detect and localize shorted turns in power system  equipment with windings.  This equipment class includes  synchronous turbine-generators, rotors, transformers and motors.   There has, to date, been no effective way to do so.  When  implemented, the technology will be invaluable for enhancing  device performance through periodic on-line shorted winding  monitoring and diagnostics.  The technology will be especially  effective when applied to aging power equipment whose reliability  is uncertain. The proposed project will be undertaken with the  cooperation of Southern California Edison who will provide in-  kind support. Southern California Edison is particularly  interested in the monitoring of shorted turns of the field  circuit of turboalternators.  Successful deployment of the  proposed technology will save millions of dollars by decreasing  direct maintainability expense and (1) by saving the added cost  of alternate more expensive energy sources (e.g. nuclear)  required during the rotor's down time and (2) by increasing the  operational life of the machine, through, for example, avoidance  of damage due to buckling.  ***",
