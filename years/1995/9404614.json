 "awd_abstract_narration": "9404614   KU    The pair of radionuclides 230Th (half-life 75,200 years) and 231 Pa  (half-life 32,500 years) produced by the decay of their respective  U parents (234U and 235U) in seawater provide important information  about the particle flux and productivity in the oceans. They have  certain advantages over other proxy indicators of  paleoproductivity: 1) The two nuclides have a constant initial  production ratio. (2) They are little affected by post-depositional  dissolution and mobilization. (3) When used as ratio 230Th/231Pa,  they are relatively insensitive to sediment focusing or  redistribution.  On the other hand, this 230Th/231Pa ratio proxy is  still a new tool needing sharpening and refinement.  Its            limitations and full potential remain to be defined and explored.  The primary objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth  investigation on this promising and important paleoceanographic  proxy. The scavenging of 230Th and 231Pa will be studied in terms  of particle composition which may affect the 230Th/231 Pa ratio in  a sediment. A new approach will be employed to assess the  distributions of 230Th and 231Pa between seawater and individual  carrier phases (clay, opal, Mn02, etc.).  The ratios in the  individual phases should serve as a more effective index than those  of a total sediment for deciphering the sedimentary record of  productivity changes in the past.  The study will be carried out in  three oceanic areas: western Pacific-Okinawa Trough, the Arabian  Sea, and regions under the California Current.  The relationship  between 230Th/231 Pa and the oxygen consumption rate in will be  examined and the possibility of using the relationship as an  empirical way of studying paleo-redox conditions will be explored.   It is anticipated that the study will contribute to our  understanding of the carbon cycles in the ocean and their response  to climate change.",
