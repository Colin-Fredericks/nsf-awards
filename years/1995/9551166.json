 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past decade, biology has been revolutionized by new  molecular procedures.   This revolution in how biological systems  are studied also requires changes in how the biological sciences  are taught.   The development of molecular techniques has been so  widespread that the training of future scientists must include  the principles, methods, and applications of these procedures.    In order to provide biology students with the best and most  current experience possible, the faculty are in the process of  modifying the curriculum to increase student exposure to  molecular biology.   This project funds the purchase of equipment  packages to expand the molecular topics addressed in sophomore  and advanced-level biology practicums and undergraduate research.    The equipment provides a realistic exposure to the techniques of  modern molecular biology.   This technique minimizes the use of  prepackaged kits that serve to facilitate an understanding of  molecular biological concepts but are limited in experimental  scope and do little to increase student understanding of DNA  technology.   The university can now expand the current  repertoire of molecular techniques to include cloning,  sequencing, and use of molecular markers in population analysis.    In addition to its use in structured laboratory exercises, this  equipment can be used to provide students conducting independent  research with a strong background in DNA analysis.   The intent  is to enhance the university's already strong undergraduate  program by instituting a program including molecular and  population genetics.",
