 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, focusses on fundamental investigations of the electron  transfer chemistry of organometallic compounds of interest as  representative reaction intermediates in catalytic processes.   During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor  Geiger and his students at the University of Vermont will study the  effects of structure on the electrochemical reactivity of  organometallic compounds containing 17 and 19 valence electrons  (17e, 19e).  Using a broad suite of electrochemical and  spectroscopic probes of structure and dynamics, the Vermont  investigators will explore the fundamental chemistry of these  systems.  Additionally, they will develop new, fiber optic based  infrared and near-infrared spectroelectrochemical techniques and  apply them to these studies.    This fundamental research addresses questions of how the structure  of organometallic compounds, particularly those of cobalt and  rhodium containing 17 and 19 valence electrons, affects their  electron transfer properties.  These questions are important to a  greater understanding of the basic chemistry of these systems and  the potential utility of this class of compounds in analytical  sensors, photooptical devices, conducting polymers, and  electrocatalysis.  Additionally, this research facilitates the  development of new spectroelectrochemical probes for the study of  interfacial electron transfer that are expected to find broad  application.",
