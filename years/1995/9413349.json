 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413349  Pohm   The SBIR Phase II project proposes several intermediate and long range research objectives to extend promising Phase I results obtained on multiple, giant magnetoresistance (GMR) read head sensors to the point where they can be applied commercially.  These objectives are to explore low temperature glasses and other materials to form a smooth surface at the top of the first half gap material deposited over the lower shield, in order to optimize the GMR material.  The use of cobalt-plantinum or other high coercivity materials at the edges of the sensors is to be explored for domain stabilization.  In addition, both sensor structures with one magnetic layer pinned by exchange and structures without pinning are to be examined and compared.  Read heads made with these GMR sensors are to be fabricated and evaluated on disks for signal output and noise.  Modeling will also be extended to the combined longitudinal, end-on structures.  Multiple folded head sensors are to be explored for use in longer range, extremely high density (1-5 billion bits/sq. in.), high performance (100 to 200 MHz), applications along with the required, optimized, integrated, SOS-CMOS or BiCMOS circuitry and connection channel.  A commercialization plan was developed which includes a follow-on commitment by the world's largest thin film head producer.",
