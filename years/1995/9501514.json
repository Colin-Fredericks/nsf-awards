 "awd_abstract_narration": "Walter Craig    NSF DMS 9501514    The principal investigator will pursue a research program in four areas of   the theory of partial differential equations, all of which are interesting   problems in mathematical analysis, and all of them motivated by problems   in mathematical physics and applied mathematics. The first topic is the   continued development of methods of Kolmogorov, Arnold and Moser (KAM)   that are suited to systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This   includes nonlinear evolution equations such as the nonlinear wave   equation, nonlinear Schrodinger equation, versions of the Korteweg deVries   equation, and the water waves system of equations for the free surface of   a fluid. The intent of the work is to understand the stable motions of   these nonlinear evolution equations, and to describe some of the principal   invariant structures of the infinite dimensional phase spaces in which   they are posed. The second project concerns further the water wave system,   and its asymptotic scaling limits in the most physically important scaling   regimes. This analysis sets rigorous bounds on the descriptions of waves   in free surfaces by modulation theory and by long wave theories described   by the Boussinesq and the Korteweg deVries equations. Several new elements   of analysis have already been introduced which are useful in numerical   modeling of the fluid dynamical problem.   The third research project concerns the evolution of singularities of   Schrodinger's equation, in both the linear and nonlinear cases. The goal   is to understand the location and structure of the singularities of the   fundamental solution, which is microlocal information and is related to   the classical trajectories of the high energy particles. Finally, the   fourth subject concerns the quantum mechanical inverse spectral problem,   the object being to understand the spectral transform in the three principal   settings of scattering theory, Floquet theory and the theory of random   potentia ls, and to quantify the similarities between these settings.       As mathematics is the language of the sciences, physical phenomena   are understood through the properties of solutions of the equations  of physics, which are for the most part partial differential equations.   The investigator's principal interests are in the equations which   describe conservative phenomena, which are most often Hamiltonian   systems. The problems that are addressed in this project proposal  are all of central importance in the physical and engineering sciences,   and govern a remarkable variety of systems, from fluid motions of  the ocean surface to the nonlinear quantum mechanics of semiconductor   devices. The goals of all four projects are to understand important   aspects of the solutions of these equations, all of which are relevant   to the understanding of the systems, and many of them which also present   very challenging problems in mathematical analysis. One observation is   that it is remarkable that one finds related structure in systems which   describe very different phenomena. For example in the first project   there is a relation between the description of nonlinear quantum   mechanics and wave phenomena in water surfaces; this becomes clear   only in the mathematical analysis of the two systems. Furthermore the   mathematical analysis has in some cases led to improvements in the   modeling of the physical systems, and to the implementation of new   computational procedures for predicting wave phenomena, which is a   topic relevant to ocean and climate modeling in the Federal strategic   interest area of global change and the environment.",
