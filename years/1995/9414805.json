 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vanderbilt University has a long tradition of excellence in its environmental and materials engineering programs, and by upgrading the facilities dedicated to these programs, the School of Engineering will strengthen its ability to educated engineers who will be able to compete in the next century.  Engineering laboratories are currently dispersed in four separate buildings, and the opportunity for consolidation and enhancement of space is available.  Support from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will assist Vanderbilt in providing modernized space for research programs in environmental engineering and advanced materials science.   Environmental engineering activities are housed in a 1952 structure that was last renovated in 1962.  The facility is antiquated with respect to plumbing; electrical, HVAC and fire safety systems required for operations.  During the period since 1962, the focus of the program has evolved from traditional sanitary engineering to examination of priority toxic, carcinogenic and radioactive wastes.  Existing laboratories were not originally designed to handle such materials, thus research and research training are being conducted in unsuitable facilities.  In addition to two separate buildings, most materials engineering programs occupy a structure that was built for metallurgical engineering in 1974.  Since that time, research is increasingly diverse and includes diamond films, radiation effects in glasses, ion beam diagnostics, ion implantation in glasses, sensor development, microstructures and containerless processing.  Facilities devoted to advanced materials processing have numerous problems including worn  casework, deficient plumbing, inadequate HVAC and no clean room processing capability.   The renovations will create a safe and conducive atmosphere that will facilitate environmental and materials engineering research that cannot be presently undertaken. Relocation of research activities in physical proximity to the physics, chemistry and geology programs with which significant collaborations with the materials program already exists should further enhance productivity, and encourage interdisciplinary research.",
