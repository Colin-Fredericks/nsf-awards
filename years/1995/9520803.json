 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520803  Wagener    The viability of acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET)  polymerization has been demonstrated during the most recent  funding period by identifying the functionalities which can  be tolerated during this condensation reaction.  This new  chemistry has led to telechelic hydrocarbon polymers  synthesized by depolymerization reactions, as well as to  many advanced polymer systems.  This grant addresses four  generally related research areas which expand upon what has  been done thus far with ADMET polymerization.  The chemistry  of conjugated dienes will be explored.  Hydrocarbon  conjugated dienes will be examined fipst followed by  expansion to aromatic conjugated dienes.  The mechanistic  enigma associated with terminal aliphatic dienes will be  elucidated.  Further, the catalyst base for ADMET chemistry  will be expanded to include considerably less expensive  systems, and speed of these reactions (the kinetics) will be  elucidated in such detail that the practical application of  these results will be well understood.  Thermoreversible  network polymers will be made with the goal of improving the  recyclability of waste plastics systems, and finally, chiral  polymers will be prepared to broaden the utility of this new  chemistry.  %%%  Interest in the commercial utility of ADMET chemistry is  high, as judged by the response from American industry  during the past three years of NSF support.  Particularly  significant are applications to the synthesis of specialty  polymers, the preparation (via depolymerization) of targeted  molecules of high commercial value, and the utility of ADMET  chemistry in the reuse of well known commercial polymers,  such as polybutadiene. This renewal builds upon all of these  opportunities. ***",
