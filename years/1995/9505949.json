 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF-CONACyT Collaborative research project concentrates on analyzing wait-free  synchronous distributed systems.  In particular, techniques from the abstract mathematical area of  simplicial algebraic topology are applied as a powerful combinatorial tool. Specifically, as modern  parallel and distributed systems scale up, there is an increasing need for algorithms and data  structures to tolerate delays and failures.  A data object or algorithm is wait-free if it guarantees  that any process can execute any operation within a fixed number of steps, independent of the level of  contention and the execution speeds of the other processes.  The goal of this project is to work  toward a comprehensive theory of wait-free synchronization.  In the past few years, a number of  researchers have developed powerful new tools, based on classical algebraic topology, for analyzing  wait-free algorithms and data structures in a variety of models.  These new techniques are used in  developing a comprehensive theory of multiprocessor synchronization.  The need for such a theory has  become compelling as tec hnological advances have made concurrent and distributed platforms readily  available.  The topological approach to these problems may represent a powerful new combinatorial tool  for Computer Science, not just for distributed computing, as for any problem area that requires  reasoning about uncertainty and partial information.",
