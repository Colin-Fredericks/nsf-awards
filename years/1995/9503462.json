Available  macroscopic DEM results on random arrays of ellipsoids  produced by others  are very promising.  They provide qualitatively correct  results and some  good quantitative predictions for a wide range of strains,  drained and  undrained loading, and static as well as cyclic loading.  However, 3-D  observations are needed for verification.  This research is  feasible with  the availability of MRI.  The results will provide a general  theoretical  framework for modeling the constitutive relations of  granular soils.  ***      9505340  Nakagawa  The objective of this research is:  1) to non-invasively  visualize the  interior and the behavior of a suitable mass of granular  material by MRI  (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), and 2) to verify the  microscopic observations  obtained by DEM (Discrete Element Method) simulations.

The primary  objective is to  develop and experimentally verify this method of  determination, with the  results applied to the determination of the constitutive  properties of  soils from the results of in situ tests and n ew types of  laboratory tests.  After developing appropriate computational aspects utilizing  neural  networks to model behavior and using the FEM, a series of  experiments will  be conducted to simulate the in situ tests.  Unlike  conventional soils  tests, in the proposed method it is essential that the  sample be subjected  to a non uniform state of strain so that different points  within the sample  can be subjected to as many different stress paths as  possible.  New soils  tests, including a relatively simple punched test, will be  developed and  tested in the laboratory.  These results will be used to  train the neural  network.  The development of methodology and the  computational aspects will  be conducted at the University of Illinois.  The  experimental part of the  proposed research will be conducted at the Johns Hopkins  University.  ***          9503697  Lade  A new method will be developed to determine constitutive  models of soils  directly from the results of soil tests.
