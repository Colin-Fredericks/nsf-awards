Practicing engineers  as   well   as   university   researchers   and   government  representatives will take the podium during the  three  days  of the conference to critically analyze the state of the art  and   to  define  future  directions  for  retrofitting   of  structures.   The  program  under the  general  umbrella  of  retrofitting, will cover a broad spectrum of research areas,  varying from risk assessment, bridge and building structures  under  wind and earthquake excitation, to effects  of  blast  loads  on  structures, to innovative retrofitting techniques  and  nondestructive evaluation.  This conference is  limited  to  invited  speakers  and attendees and  will  represent  a  unique   opportunity   for  knowledge/technology   transfer,  creating  an  intellectually  challenging  environment   for  exchanging  ideas  and techniques among various  sectors  of  engineering.",
