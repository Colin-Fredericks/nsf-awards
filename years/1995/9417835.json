 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Douglas Dorset, Medical Foundation of Buffalo, is supported by a   grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the   Chemistry Division and the Polymers Program in the Division of Materials   Research to continue his research in the development of direct methods   for use in electron crystallography of organic compounds and polymers.    He is working with Herb Hauptman (who shared the 1985 Nobel Prize in   Chemistry with Jerome Karle for related work) to develop a direct phasing   method for electron crystallographic data for the ab initio determination   of unknown crystal structures.  A number of steps are being taken to   improve the reliability of the technique including: 1) improving a figure   of merit for automated procedures that are more resistant to dynamical   scattering; 2) developing more reliable phasing procedures; 3)   incorporating a multislice calculation to improve refinement; 4)   developing a better understanding of the limitations of crystallographic   phase determination; and 5) increasing the use of higher voltage sources   to ensure data closer to the single scattering limit.  Applications   include: 1) oriented films of poly (tetrafluorotheylene) ; 2) small   molecules such as C60 and C70, copper phthalocyanine and copper   perfluorophthalocyanine, and 3) alkane chains substituted with ester,   ether, amine and keto groups.  By far the most widely used structural tool is X-ray crystallography.    One of the reasons for it's widespread use is the fact that techniques   have been developed for automatically solving the phase problem for many   systems.  In spite of this, there are limitations to X-ray   crystallography arising primarily from the difficulty of obtaining   crystals of suitable size.  Electron crystallography should provide a   complementary alternative to X-ray diffraction for cases where the latter   technique is problematic.  Dorset's work is directed at attempting to   improve the electron crystallographic technique to the point where it   will be as automated and as easy to use as X-ray crystallography now is.",
