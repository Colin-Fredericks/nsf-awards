 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inorganic and organic peroxides are detected in the atmosphere  and in rain, snow and fog, and there is evidence that their  concentration has been increasing.  Peroxides interfere with normal  plant growth, and play an important role in the conversion of  sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid in cloud water.  Photochemical air  pollution involves a complex set of chemical reactions initiated by  sunlight-generated free radicals.  These reactions both consume and  generate peroxides, and are the subject of active research aimed at  developing effective pollution control strategies.  Hydrogen  peroxide concentration increases with solar intensity, but diurnal  profiles of organic peroxides suggest an alternative source,  possibly involving ozone and biogenic hydrocarbons.  This research  will involve laboratory and field studies aimed at a better  understanding of peroxide occurrence and chemistry.  The project  scientists will develop the ability to detect trace concentrations  of individual peroxides using high performance liquid  chromatography with fluorescence detection, and study the rate at  which individual peroxides deposit to grasslands and forest  canopies.  Undergraduate chemistry majors at a small four-year  college will participate in all aspects of this Research in  Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project.",
