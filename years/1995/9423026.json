The methods of the study are ethnographic and historical and the site of the ethnographic work is Gloucester, Massachusetts.  The project aims to document and analyze beliefs and practices of social grouns in this highly state-regulated social field; to link legal events in the social field to later and longer-term social ecological processes, and to develop a methodology for longitudinal studies of lawmaking in highly regulated social fields in complex societies.  %%%%  Cod, haddock, flounder and other \"groundfish\" have been fished off the coast of New England for at least 350 years.  Indeed it was the reports of abundant cod in coastal waters that drew English colonists in the 1620s to the area that became Gloucester,, Massachusetts.  Economically and culturally important to the region, groundfish species have experienced cycles of decline and recovery for at least 100 years, but the present decline is apparently unprecedented.  A predominant belief that this decline is due to overfishing has led to significant regulation of the New England fishing industry in an effort to restore fish stocks.  Though not new, the regulation efforts are extensive and intimately tied to the economic, ecological, and cultural contexts of the region.  This project aims to study lawmaking processes in this field through a combination of ethnographic and historical techniques.  The combination of the ethnographic and historical research should create a large data base that will support a longitudinal study of lawmaking in a highly regulated social field in a complex society, and contribute to comparative studies of lawmaking in such fields.  ****",
