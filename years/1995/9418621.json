 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  This award supports a project to test the recent hypothesis that Laurentia (the cratonic  part of present-day North America) was adjacent to the East Antarctic craton during late  Proterozoic time and was therefore a part of Gondwana.  The hypothesized geographic  disposition of these continental masses has far-reaching implications for the assembly,  evolution, and breakup of Gondwana.  This hypothesis, however, has not yet been  substantially tested.  If Laurentia did breakout of Gondwana from a position adjacent to  Antarctica, rift-related sediments should record this event and contain detritus, including  detrital zircon, derived from the rifting continent.  Late Proterozoic metasedimentary  rocks exposed throughout the Transantarctic Mountains (including the La Gorce,  Duncan, Goldie, and Cobham Formations, and the Skelton and Koettlitz Groups) are  the most-likely candidates for such rocks.  This project will produce a geochronometric  inventory of detrital zircons from samples of these units distributed along the length of  the Transantarctic Mountains.  The geochronometric data will provide a useful test of  the hypothesis and will complement on-going detrital zircon studies of other Proterozoic  rocks in the Transantarctic Range.",
