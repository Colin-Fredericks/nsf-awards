 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520700  Ziff    This project concerns basic research on two fundamental  problems of material systems:  the percolation transition in  random media and cooperativity in surface reactions, such as  in heterogeneous catalysis.  The work on percolation  revolves around gaining a fundamental understanding of the  quantity that gives the probability of crossing a system of  linear dimension L from one conducting side to the other,  with given boundary conditions on the other sides.  The  investigator will carry out studies in both two and three  dimensions.  The work on catalysis begins with the Ziff,  Gulari, and Barshad model of CO oxidation.  He will study  this model  near the first-order transition and spinodal  points to determine the importance of surface effects and  metastability for that transition.  He will also consider  models for the NO-CO reactions, involving for the first time  multiple pathways for N reaction.  This work will lead to a  substantial advance in the understanding of the phenomena  available to these out-of-equilibrium, driven, surface  reaction systems, and help in developing models that have  practical application to real catalytic systems.  %%%  This project concerns research on two fundamental problems  of materials systems.  The first involves percolation in  random media.  The project involves understanding the  probability of crossing a system of a given size from one  conducting side to the other.  This work has applications to  flow through porous media (such as oil extraction through  the ground) and electrical conduction in random systems  (relating to the electrical breakdown of materials).  The  second involves a model of CO oxidation, which the authored  developed several years ago and which many other researchers  have also studied.  This model is practically important as  the foundation of practical models for surface reactions,  such as those that take place in an automotive catalytic  converter.  ***",
