 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550752  Bauer    The Shiprock Campus of Navajo Community College is operated by  the Navajo Nation and serves over 500 students per year in the  largest population center of the Navajo Nation.  The College is  requesting support from the National Science Foundation to  continue and expand the operation of a Science Honors Program for  Navajo students entering science fields.  Support is requested  for 1) a full-time Project Coordinator, Student Support  Coordinator, Academic Tutors, and Secretary; 2) funds for staff  travel to implement and coordinate the program and for student  travel for enrichment activities; and 3) scholarships for twenty  students per year.  This support will result in the recruitment  of fifteen academically well-qualified students each year to the  Shiprock Campus of Navajo Community College in science fields  (ten funded through NSF support, two through Johnson & Johnson  Environmental Scholarships, two from Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratory's American Indian Program, and one additional  Environmental Scholarship funded through a Department of Defense  program).  These students will be provided with financial  assistance, travel funds to visit local industry, national labs,  and to conferences to make research presentations.  They will  initially participate in a summer program to prepare them for  college-level coursework through academic enrichment, cooperative  learning and study skills.  Subsequent summers will be spent in  research placements in other university programs, or at national  laboratories or private industry (all expenses provided through  programs of these institutions).  Math workshops for calculus  classes are modeled after successful programs at UC Berkeley and  CalPoly.  Partnerships with four national laboratories two large  corporations, and ten large regional universities provide  scholarship internships, long-term equipment loans and networking  assistance.  This project has the potential of preparing a  steadily increasing number of you ng Navajo students to succeed in  science because of its location and the unique mission of Navajo  Community college.",
