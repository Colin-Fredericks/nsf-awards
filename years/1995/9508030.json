 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508030  Hofmeister         This grant provides $16,490 for 2/3 support of the cost of  upgrading control software for an infrared spectrometer at  Washington-St. Louis (WUSTL) used in studies of mineral physics.   A PC platform will be purchased with the PI's existing research  funds and will replace an outdated DEC PDP-11 platform.   Replacement hardware for these computers is becoming increasingly  scarce and software is no longer developed for these platforms.   The PI recently joined the faculty at Washington University-St.  Louis (WUSTL) and was able to bring much of her equipment from her  former laboratory at the University of California-Davis (UCD).   Conversion of the control system to a PC based platform will allow  the PI to streamline data reduction and analysis as it will remove  cross-platform transfer that was previously necessary.  The  principal investigator's research in mineral physics uses  vibrational spectroscopy at ambient and high pressures to elucidate  the thermochemical properties of rockforming minerals.  In this  regard she is considered a principal contributor to this unique  field.  Many collaborators maintained PCbased control systems for  their IR spectrometers and will donate reduction programs presently  available.  Further collaboration should be enhanced by development  of common platform data reduction programs.  ***",
