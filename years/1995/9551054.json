 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project centers on the introduction of modern infrared  spectroscopy into the chemistry curriculum, beginning in the  general chemistry laboratory and proceeding to the organic  laboratory.   General chemistry students are using FT-IR  spectroscopy in both the first and second semesters of the  laboratory, in the context of group-based open-ended research  projects.   The sophistication of their observations and uses of  the spectra will progress as students increase their chemical  knowledge.   Even those students who do not go on to take any  more chemistry (the majority) will have had quite extensive  exposure to modern instrumentation by the end of two semesters of  chemistry.   FT-IR is also being used in the organic laboratories  in a newly developed curriculum that extends the developments  made in the general chemistry labs.",
