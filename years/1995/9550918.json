 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biology is implementing a revised curriculum  that emphasizes the process of science through investigative  laboratories.   Students begin their study of biology with  courses in Structure and Function of Organisms and Evolution and  Ecology in the first year.   In the second year, students take  courses in Molecular Genetics and The Biology of Cells.   The  latter course, which will emphasize the roles of proteins in  cells, is one of the primary targets of curricular improvements.    A modern course in cell biology is being taught by emphasizing  how cells are studied.   Students who have learned many  applications of techniques in molecular genetics to study cells  from their prior coursework can now attend a new section on  antibodies as tools in cell biology in the new course.   For this  project, a cryostat prepares frozen sections quickly and easily  and preserves the antigenicity of proteins from various  specimens.   These frozen sections are then stained with  commercially available antibodies with a greater likelihood of  success than the old method of using paraffin-embedded material.    Use of antibodies as tools to study protein distribution is also  a major part of the laboratories in an upper-level course in  developmental biology, a summer program for minority high school  students, and research projects in both the biology and  psychology departments.   In addition the use of this modern  instrumentation, communication of results to other students will  be emphasized.   For this emphasis and for improvment of  students' training in light microscopy, a research-quality  teaching microscope equipped for fluorescence microscopy,  photomicroscopy, and video imaging is also being purchased.    This microscope makes it possible for groups of students to view  their results together instead of in isolation.   This new  microscope also allows students to have a permanent record of  their results for later analysis.",
