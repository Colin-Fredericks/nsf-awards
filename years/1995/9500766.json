 "awd_abstract_narration": "Murray       Traction forces are a crucial mechanism of pattern formation  in morphogenesis.  Cells of many types, when seeded on Matrigel,  form aggregates due solely to traction forces.  The traction  mechanically deforms the gel, creating fiber tracks between  aggregates.  The fiber tracks induce cells to elongate and migrate  along them by contact guidance.  The pattern formation occurs  sufficiently quickly that there are no complications of cell  proliferation or secretion or degradation of the matrix, affording  a unique opportunity to study pattern formation by traction forces  in isolation.  The investigator and his colleague develop and  analyze a mathematical model of the cellular tractions and the  resultant mechanical response of the Matrigel, incorporating a  description of the essential material and behavioral anisotropy  which develops in response to traction.  Analysis consists of  linear bifurcation analysis, nonlinear analysis where appropriate,  and a strong component of numerical analysis.  The latter entails  development of algorithms to simulate the nonlinear conservation  and evolution equations in two spatial dimensions.  The study aims  at a deeper understanding of biological traction and the mechanics  of extracellular matrix, and ultimately to a greater understanding  of morphogenesis and remodeling in general.       The investigators develop and analyze a mathematical model of  a particular case of cellular pattern formation with the aim of a  better, more fundamental understanding of (1) the mechanical  interaction by traction forces between cells and their growth  medium (natural or artificial), (2) the subtle anisotropic  mechanics of the extracellular matrix that forms a large part of  the human body, (3) later restructuring such as wound healing and  tumor growth, (4) human embryonic development, and (5) biological  pattern formation in general.  The technique of mathematical  modeling allows a logical construction of biological theories to  test, and a method o f testing those theories with \"mathematical  experiments.\" Furthermore, the analysis of the mathematical model  leads to predictions which may then be confirmed or refuted by  appropriate laboratory experiments.  It is by a close communication  between experiment and theory that understanding is gained.  The  project addresses fundamental biological questions using  mathematical and computational techniques, in close collaboration  with experimentalists.",
