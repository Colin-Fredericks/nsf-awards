 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453043  Lemme  The Philadelphia USI (PUSI) is designed as a series of vertical networks, each of which is built  upon a community of students, teachers, principals, staff and parents centered upon one of the  district's 22 K-12 elementary-to-high school feeder pattern clusters.  These networks are linked  by cross-cluster (city-wide) networks of discrete interest groups (science teachers, mathematics  teachers, technology specialists, principals) and by district-wide community partnerships.  The  PUSI seeks to: (1) implement a national standards-based K-12 MST curriculum delivered  through instructional methods which actively involve students in their own learning; (2) enact  a systemic professional development program incorporating extant NSF-funded programs,  university partners and school site-based professional development that employs mentor teachers;  (3) produce an extensive student support services network developed in conjunction with the  Philadelphia Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities, local informal science institutions  and other community partners; (4) begin the use of performanae-based student assessment to  complement traditional assessments; (5) develop parent and community partnerships in support  of MST education; and (6) work with the Philadelphia \"NSF Collaborative for Excellence in  Teacher Preparation\" to produce future teachers whose abilities and attitudes complement USI  objectives and goals.  ***",
