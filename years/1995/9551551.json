 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project instructs senior-level Radiological Health  Engineers, Nuclear Engineers, Safety Engineers, and Industrial  Hygienists in the proper techniques and procedures for measuring  radioactivity levels in the environment.   This area has become a  major focus of the nuclear industry in the years following the  accidents at Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island.   The course  utilizes state-of-the-art technology in order to expose  undergraduates to new radiation detectors already in use in  modern environmental analysis laboratories.   In addition to the  laboratory aspect, three in-field exercises are used, including  an emergency response drill and field trips to local nuclear  reactor utilities.   The course contains sections on measuring  environmental radiation fields, environmental sample collection  and analysis, trace element analysis, radon assay analysis,  measurements of occupational radiation fields, and radiological  emergency response.   At this time, no other institution offers a  complete laboratory course on these topics.   The class  culminates in a radiological emergency response drill in which  students participate in the annual NRC required reactor accident  drill at one of the school's research reactors.   This phase  allows students to use portable radiation detectors to quantify  any contamination surrounding the facility using techniques  presented during the semester.",
