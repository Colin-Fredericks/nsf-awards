 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504015  Phule  Personal communication services (PCS) represent a burgeoning and  revolutionary family of microwave based technologies (400 MHz to  30 GHz).  Familiar examples include cellular telephones, wireless  cable, direct broadcast, and interactive television. To store,  transfer, and filter electromagnetic waves, components based on  ceramic materials are indispensable.  New and better ceramics for  wireless communications (CWC), characterized by exceptionally  high quality factors, a relatively high dielectric constant, and  adequate temperature stability will be highly desirable for  further miniaturization and enhanced performance of certain  microwave components.  The major goal of this program is to  conduct a systematic investigation of the synthesis and  processing of potentially novel ceramic materials for microwave  applications.  Our research is being conducted so as to gain  deeper insights into the fundamental relationships between the  atomic level defects, heterogeneous interfaces, and the microwave  dielectric properties of ceramic materials.  %%%  For achieving the central goal of our research, it is critical to  measure the dielectric properties of materials, in the microwave  frequency range (400 MHz to 40 GHz).  Using a microwave network  analyzer is the only direct way to characterize such microwave  properties.  This award provides funds to acquire such a network  analyzer.  Presently, this unit is not available at the  University of Pittsburgh.  This instrument will enhance the  quality of the research program.  Using the network analyzer, we  will be able to experimentally determine the microwave properties  in relation to the composition and microstructure of sintered,  polycrystalline ceramics in the tantalum oxide-zirconia, niobium  oxidezirconia, and other systems.  We plan to investigate the  influence of composition, and micorstructural features (such as  grain size, porosity, and grain boundary microchemistry) of  samples processed using different sintering  time-temperature  profiles.  We also seek to understand the influence of controlled  levels of different dopants and impurities on the microwave  dielectric constant and quality factor of different compositions.  These properties will be measured at different temperatures (100-  500 K) so as to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that  influence microwave properties.  ***",
