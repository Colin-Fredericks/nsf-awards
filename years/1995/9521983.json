 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521983  Joye    Nitrification, a central process in the nitrogen cycle, may  significantly alter partitioning of the regenerated nitrogen flux  between release from sediments to the water column as ammonium  versus loss as dinitrogen gas via coupled denitrification.   Nitrogen release from freshwater sediments consists of comparable  amounts of dinitrogen gas and ionic forms, suggesting that coupled  nitrification-denitrification is more efficient in freshwater than  in marine environments.    This team of investigators will examine the effects of methane and  hydrogen sulfide, which differ in concentration and distribution  between marine and freshwater environments, on nitrification.  They  hypothesize that co-metabolism affects the spatial and temporal  distribution of nitrification in aquatic sediments, particularly in  freshwater environments.  They will examine the role of competitive  (substrate) interactions and the effect of variations in the  oxidizing bacterial community composition (presence of nitrifying  vs. methane-oxidizing bacteria) on nitrification.  They also  hypothesize that hydrogen sulfide, a potent inhibitor of  nitrification, may affect the spatial and temporal distribution of  nitrification in marine sediments.    Understanding the relationship between bacterial community  composition, bacterial physiology and geochemically-driven changes  in physiology will improve our understanding of nitrogen cycling in  sediments and will provide a conceptual framework for improved  predictive models of coupled nitrification-denitrification.",
