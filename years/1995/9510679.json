 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. LeRoy Peterson, Jr., Department of Chemistry and Physics, Francis   Marion University, is supported under a Research Planning Grant for   Minority Scientists and Engineers by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for the study   of zinc and cadmium complexes which model the action of these metals in   biological systems. To this end a series of zinc and cadmium compounds   utilizing poly(pyrazolyl)borate, nucleic acid, and carboxylate ligands   will be prepared and characterized. The structures and properties of   these complexes will be used to understand the interactions of the metals   with complex biological molecules.   Zinc plays important roles in a diverse series of enzymes and is involved   in many biochemical processes including DNA replication, recognition,   rewinding, and degradation. Chemically cadmium is closely related to   zinc, but, in contrast to zinc, is quite toxic. The major goal of the   research is to establish the important aspects of the chemistry of zinc   and cadmium that govern their behavior in biological systems. A   significant portion of this planning grant will involve the establishment   of collaborative arrangements with nearby laboratories, which will allow   Dr. Peterson and his students access to instrumentation not available at   Francis Marion University.",
