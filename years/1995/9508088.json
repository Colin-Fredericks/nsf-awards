 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508088  Miller    The long term goal of this project is to address mechanistic  questions concerning the orderly differentiation and spatial  organization of diverse cell types into morphologies specific for  a tissue or developmental state. Conidiation in the filamentous  fungus Aspergillus nidulans offers the unique opportunity to  investigate molecular mechanisms that control multicellular  development in eukaryotes.  Conidiation is characterized by its  highly synchronous nature and the spatial organization of a limited  number of differentiated cell types. A genetic hierarchy consisting  of five essential regulatory genes controls 1) the transition from  multinucleate filamentous growth to uninucleate budding growth, the  assembly of a multicellular reproductive structure  (conidiophore)and 3) the production of dormant conidia (spores).  Complex regulatory interactions provide a mechanism for  establishing overlapping spatiotemporal gradients in the  transcription factors which, in turn, coordinately activate  hundreds of conidiation specific genes. The objectives of this  proposal are to begin elucidating mechanisms that integrate  spatiotemporal control of developmental gene expression with  alterations in cell cycle regulation. Dr. Miller is approaching  this problem through a molecular analysis of the modifier genes  Medusa (medA) and Stunted (stuA). The medA protein is required for  commitment to the developmental program, functioning as a co-  activator of a subset of target genes. The stuA protein belongs to  a family of transcription factors that control cell cycle  progression and fungal development. The specific objectives are to  1) identify, isolate and characterize regulatory gene(s) required  for competence dependent stuA transcription, one of the earliest  events of the developmental program; 2) identify and characterize  gene(s) required for early induction dependent, brlA-independent  medA transcription; 3) functionally characterize the medA and stuA  proteins; 4) isol ate stuA target genes and 5) characterize  extragenic suppressors of stuA mutations and extragenic mutations  that mimic the Stunted phenotype.  ***",
