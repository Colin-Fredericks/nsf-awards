This prestigious meeting is held once every three years and brings together the international community of scientists and engineers working on a variety of aspects of C1 metabolism by microorganisms, including both methylotrophic and autotrophic cells.  The small size and traditional informality of this conference provide a unique opportunity for researchers from different disciplines to interact, share information, and develop long-lasting ties.  It is traditional for all speakers and poster presenters to provide their latest, unpublished data and, as a result, this conference always serves as the focal point for future research in this diverse field.  A wide range of research topics will be presented including discussions on catalytic mechanisms of oxidases, oxygenases and quinoproteins, genetic regulation of complex genetic regulons, and new approaches for understanding and manipulating microb ial metabolism for both environmental and commercial applications. %%% This NSF award is funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Division of Environmental Biology (Directorate of Biological Sciences), and the Division of Ocean Sciences (Directorate of Geosciences). ***                         ;                                                                 Oh     +'  0                                       D       h                                               @       d                                             S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                   $   Metabolic Biochemistry Program Note                                 Shelley A.
