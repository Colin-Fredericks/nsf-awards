 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416838  Newton    This project entails laboratory analysis of an extensive set  of chlorophyll-labeling experiments that have been conducted  in three different marine environments which represent very  different physical and biological regimes:  the equatorial  Pacific, an oceanic upwelling area; the California boundary  current, a coastal upwelling site; and Dabob Bay, a  temperate fjord with seasonal  blooms.  Roughly 500 samples  comprising multi-depth (7-8) profiles were obtained using  identical sampling and procedural techniques.  Within each  environment, large variations in growth conditions (e.g.,  light, nutrients temperature, etc.) were evident, associated  with physical (e.g., EL Nino, seasonal upwelling,  stratification) and biological (e.g., blooms,  biogeographical shifts) variation.  Analysis of these  experiments entails using high-performance liquid  chromatography to isolate chlorophyll a for determination of  its specific activity.  Results will yield estimates of  phytoplankton carbon:chlorophyll ratios and specific growth  rates.  Correlation and regression analysis will be  conducted to gain insight into phytoplankton growth response  to physical forcing within and between these three very  different environments. The data set carbon:chlorophyll  (C:chl) ratios and phytoplankton specific growth rates (u)  generated will be unprecedented in size and comprehensives.  Because of these attributes, statistical analysis will be  meaningful and our basic understanding of phytoplankton  growth and cellular adaptation in relation to environmental  and biological conditions will be increased.  These analyses  will result in a better appreciation for the variability in  these parameters under different field conditions. Yet, more  importantly, because sampling within an environment spanned  variations in growth conditions that were quantified, these  comparisons can yield quantitative insight to the master  variables in determining phytoplankton specific growth rate  in the field.     A hypothesis to be evaluated is that an algorithm can be  developed such that typically measured parameters, such as  nutrients, light, and species composition, can constrain  phytoplankton specific growth rate (u) adequately for  modeling purposes.  The results will be useful for  estimating the errors induced from modeling efforts where  C:chl ratio or u measurements do not exist. Field  measurements of u are rare in many environments.  The pool  of physical, chemical and biological support data that  exists for each of the three projects will afford insight  into phytoplankton response to physical forcing within each  of the  three different environments.  ***",
