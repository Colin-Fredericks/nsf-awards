The Greater Boston Logic Conference, to be held at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology on May 27-30, 1995, is a  continuation and expansion of this biennial conference series.   Each day of the four-day conference will be divided into morning  and afternoon sessions, of which the morning sessions will  consist of plenary lectures by the invited speakers, of interest  to a general audience of logicians.       Each afternoon session will consist of three or more  simultaneous workshops, each workshop emphasizing an advanced  topic within Model Theory, Recursion Theory, or Set Theory.   These will include workshops on Model Theory and Analytic  Functions, Applied Stability Theory, Degree Theory, and Inner  Model Theory and Fine Structure.  The workshops' goal is to aid  both established mathematicians and graduate students to break  into important, fast developing, and technically difficult areas.   Workshop speakers will be encouraged to give complete proofs and  to explain the methods and intuition behind them; there will be  considerable time devoted to questions and discussion.  The  majority of the funds provided by the National Science Foundation  will defray travel expenses for graduate students and postdocs.   Funds will also be used for invited speakers without other grant  support.  ***",
