The ultimate goal is to understand the properties of  liquid crystals in terms of their molecular structural  features to allow rational designs for new mesogens  optimized for specific applications (high contrast ratios,  rapid switching, high spontaneous polarization, etc.). This  is achieved through carefully constructed experiments and  associated modeling of the experimental findings with the  intention of deriving a general formulation of molecular  ordering in LCs in terms of an orientational potential.  Knowledge of orientational potentials allows one to  construct the molecular orientation distribution and thereby  calculate a molecule's order tensor, and compute and  correlate thermodynamic properties of mesogens with  molecular structure.  %%%  This project is concerned with the measurement of molecular  properties in liquid crystals (LCs) so that improved LCs can  be engineered for new display applications such as high  definition TV. This is achieved by studying the behavior of  selected solutes dissolved in LC solvents in order to  clarify the importance of the different kinds of  intermolecular interactions that contribute to the electro  optic responses of these unusual fluids. The goal is an  increased understanding of the molecular origins of  important physical and technologically significant  characteristics of liquid crystals (e.g., birefringence,  spontaneous electric polarization) with the ulterior motive  of designing more responsive and higher contrast materials  for LC displays.",
