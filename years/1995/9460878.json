Direct-Sequence  Spread-Spectrum Multiple-Access (DS/SSMA) has long been the  technology of choiae in a wid evariety of satellite and military  radio networks where multiple-access capabilities, anti-jamming,  low probability of interceptm, and dynamic topologies are  important.  DS/SSMA technology is emerging as a likely modulation  choice in emerging space and third-generation commercial mobile  radio networks (e.g. personal communication systems) and in  indoor wireless communications.  The performance degradation  casused by the dissimilarity of the received powers of a set of  users who transmit simultaneously through the same channel.  Multiuser detection promises substantial gains in bit-error-rate,  which in turn afford the possibility of eliminating the need for  power control and a significant reduciton in the number of chips-  per-symbol (spreading ratio) necessary to sustain a desired level  of multiuser capability.  Neural algorithms are naturally suited  to the training and adaptation of multiuser detection algorithms  to realize those gains in practice.  The proposed project will  develop neural-network-based adaptive signal processing  architectures for near-far-resistant demodulation of spread-  spectrum multiple-access signals.  This approach will lead to  significant advances in the ability to use direct-sequence spread-  spectrum formats in emerging radio networks    ***",
