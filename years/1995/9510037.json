 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vivian    Under the direction of Dr. R. Gwinn Vivian, Ms. Ruth Van Dyke  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will examine  site plans for 9 Bonito-style prehistoric sites which are located  in New Mexico in the Chaco Canyon region. At seven of the sites,  extensive surface remains  and architectural ruins have already  been mapped and Ms. Van Dyke will digitize the site plans. This  will facilitate spatial analysis. At the remaining two sites Ms.  Van Dyke and assistants will use a laser transit system to  produce comparable data. With this information she shall search  for similarities and differences between sites and compare these  to central Chaco Canyon ruins. Within sites she will attempt to  determine social relations among occupants and learn whether a  hierarchical system existed. Factors such as room size,  arrangement and accessibility will provide a means to address  this question.    In the centuries immediately preceding contact with the Old  World, Southwest Native American societies developed complex  social systems and built sites with multi-story architecture  which accommodated hundreds of individuals. A center for such  development was Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. It is clear that a  strong relationship existed between Chaco Canyon and over 100  outlying communities since a system of prehistoric roads connects  many of these sites. However archaeologists do not understand how  the Chaco system functioned. They do not know whether the Chaco  \"center\" is responsible for the establishment of the outlier or  whether essentially independent communities cooperated and that  the periphery, in effect, created the core. It is also not known  whether these communities were essentially equalitarian or  hierarchial. The question is important because it will shed light  on the social processes which gave rise to this well known  society. Through architectural analysis Ms. Van Dyke can address  both of these issues.    This research is important for several reasons. It will  provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light  on the development of social complexity and will assist in the  training of a promising young scientist.",
