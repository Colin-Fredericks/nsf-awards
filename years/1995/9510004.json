 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa will use this award from the Chemistry  Instrumentation and Facilities Program to help purchase a state-of-the-art mass spectrometer with  capabilities not currently available.  The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the  acquisition include the following:  synthesis and characterization of polyfluorinated  phosphonate polymers, structural studies of novel natural products from fungi,  characterization of transition metal complexes and polymers produced by reactions they  catalyze, identification of lipids present in inseparable mixtures, identification of enzyme  metabolites, and characterization of novel nucleoside phosphonates.    Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain  the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules.   The acquisition of a mass spectrometer is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in  many fields in chemistry, and a modern data handling system improves the instrument control  and the efficiency of the facility.",
