 "awd_abstract_narration": "9409259  Pinsky       It is generally accepted that all nuclear matter is composed  of quarks held together by the exchange of gluons.  The theory  that describes these interactions is known as quantum  chromodynamics or QCD.  While the broadest outlines of this  theory are known, many important details are yet to be  understood.  One of the leading approaches to a more refined  understanding employs a technique, pioneered in the 60's, known  as light front field theory (LFFT).       The fifth annual workshop on LFFT applied to QCD will be  held this summer in Telluride, Colorado bringing together for two  weeks from around the world the leading workers in this area.       The discussions will certainly be lively and will, in  particular, significantly affect the research focus of the many  students in attendance.  The workshop is likely to lead to  significant progress in our understanding of QCD.  ***",
