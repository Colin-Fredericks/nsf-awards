 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503896  Nystuen    This technology development project is to test and improve an  acoustic inversion algorithm to measure rain from the ambient sound  field within the ocean.  The underwater sound field produced by  rain upon the surface contains information about drop size  distribution within the rain.  Rainfall is an important mechanism  for exchanging heat and certain chemicals such as carbon between  the oceans and atmosphere, but measurements are sparse and  difficult to make.  The technique to be developed will allow  estimation of rainfall over a broad area by using remote ocean  drifters and buoys.  Rainfall upon the ocean surface can be  detected by underwater sensors and the type and relative intensity  of rainfall may be determined by examining the acoustic  characteristics.  The acoustic technique to be validated will  be able to differentiate between rain types (stratiform vs.  convective) by drop-size analysis and provide a rapid temporal  response for accurate estimates of rainfall over large spatial  scales.  This project involves the placement of acoustic receivers  offshore from two locations where there is doppler weather radar  coverage.  Acoustic signals received and isolated from the ambient  sound field in the ocean will be compared with radar images of  overlying rainfall so that quantitative estimates of rain can be  associated with specific acoustic signatures.  If successful,  acoustic sensors can then be placed in remote areas of the oceans  to greatly expand available data on rainfall amounts that are  important to studies of climate variability.",
