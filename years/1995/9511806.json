 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research grant supports the international linkage costs to enable Dr. Serap Aksoy, Assistant Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at Yale University School of Medicine, and a postdoctoral associate, to conduct field-based studies in Africa over a three-year period, to understand the fundamental biological relationships between symbiotic microorganisms and the tsetse (genus Glossina).  The work will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. S.K. Moloo, Head of the Tsetse Research Laboratory at the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (LRAD), in Nairobi, Kenya.  The research will focus on host-symbiont coevolution in tsetse and its gut- and ovary-tissue associated endosymbionts. Building on current understanding of the phylogeny and the potential function of these organisms based on observations of a limited set of laboratory colonies, the international collaboration will permit research with wild flies and flies from other colonies.  In Nairobi, the PI will collect specimens from the wild and from laboratory strains from Vienna and Canada, and will extract and store the nucleic acids and other materials for analysis. The first aim is to evaluate the concordant evolution hypothesis of tsetse and their endosymbionts and to validate the constructed phylogeny for genus Glossina  using field collected insects.  The second goal is to evaluate the extent and the stability of Wolbachia -mediated Cytoplasmic Incompatibility phenomenon in tsetse in nature.  The collaborative relationship between the international partners and their institutions builds on their complementary strengths. The facilities, size of colonies, and availability of technical personnel at ILRAD make possible microinjection and mating experiments on a scale that would be difficult to undertake at the PI's home laboratory. The novel approach of using insect symbionts to disrupt the biology of disease-transmitting insects promises immense potential benefit for developing countries and the global economy.",
