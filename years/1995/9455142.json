 "awd_abstract_narration": "Powerful multimedia authoring tools now becoming available permit  engineering educators to develop multimedia courseware with much  less effort than ever before. Without familiarity with the  principles of instruction design, it is easy for engineering  educators to run amuck and produce ineffective multimedia  instructional materials. The goal of this workshop is to instruct  30 educators who teach engineering or pre-engineering the basics of  instructional design, particularly as applied to multimedia  instructional materials in engineering. The workshop sessions will  be taught largely by an experienced instructional designer who is  also experienced in teaching mathematics and science in the  classroom, as well as commercial courses in multimedia  instructional design. SIMPLE, a powerful but easy-to-use software  construction environment developed with partial support from an NSF  Course and Curriculum Development Project, will serve as one of the  tools. Multimedia courseware from the NSF-supported coalitions will  be introduced as examples. The workshop team consists of members  from ExperTech, a small software company, Amarillo College, a two  year institution, and Texas Tech University, a doctoral  institution. The team members will interact extensively with the  participants throughout the 2-year period by means of a special  mailing list on the Internet. Besides communication at conferences,  an FTP site on the Internet will permit easy distribution of  developed software. The workshop participants will be instructed in  the basics of evaluation methodologies throughout the workshop so  that they can effectively evaluate the courseware they use or  develop.",
