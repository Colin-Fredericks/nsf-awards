 "awd_abstract_narration": "While shared-memory multiprocessors simplify many  aspects of programming, it is widely believed that naive shared-  momory  programs are not likely to result in high performance on  most shared-memory  systems.  The broad objective is to develop  and evaluate techniques for  improving the performance of shared-  memory systems while simultaneously  enhancing programmability and  portability.    A key problem that inhibited  performance in shared-memory systems  is that, unlike message passing programs,  the exact communication  requirements of shared-memory programs are not obvious.  Therefore, compilers, runtime systems, and hardware typically  need to make  conservative assumptions, resulting in excessive  communication and  synchronization primitives provided on a  particular machine (e.g., locks and  barriers), the intended  sharing behavior is obscured by these details.  Furthermore, the  low-level primitives that must be used to obtain good  performance  vary from platform to platform, thus inhibiting program  portability.    This research takes an integrated approach to improving the  performance, and portability of systems.  The approach broadly  is:  (1) to  identify common implementation-independent  communication patterns along with  primitive to express those  patterns in a programming language, (2) to develop  heuristics  that can be used by the compiler, runtime systems, hardware or  some  combination thereof to map these high-level primitives to  the appropriate  low-level primitives supported by the particular  target system, and (3) to  evaluate the resulting performance  benefits on the system.  By exposing the  intended sharing  behavior, many instances of unnecessary communication should  be  avoided, thus achieving higher performance.  Furthermore, despite  the  larger variety of synchronization patterns that a programmer  must choose from  his or her task is simplified because details of  implementing the patterns are  left to the programming support  system (note tha t the sharing patterns  themselves must be  understood by the programmer anyway).  Finally, in  combination  with other projects within the overall research program, this  research should demonstrate that these common, high-level  synchronization  patterns can be efficiently supported on a  variety of platforms, thus enhancing  the portability of the  program.    This part of the research program is focused  on investigating a  specific kind of target system - a hardware distributed  shared-  memory multiprocessor that provides software control for  protocols and  efficient active message support (e.g., Stanford  Flash and Wisconsin Typhoon)-  using execution-driven simulation.  Other  projects in this research program are  already exploring  similar issues on other types of target systems.  Education:  The educational objectives fall within three broad  areas:  curriculm development, teaching methods, and education  outside the classroom.  The objectives of the curriculm  development part are (1) to introduce a course  in parallel  computing involving computational scientists and engineers along  with computer scientists (both in terms of students attending and  faculty  teaching the course), (2)  to introduce hands-on parallel  programming  experience as part of currently existing  undergraduate computer architecture  course, (3) to impart a sound  education on performance analysis techniques, and  (4) to impart a  research experience  to undergraduates by having a modest  research project as part of the senior level architecture course  and by  actively recruiting undergraduates in the proposed  research program through the  Rice senior honor's thesis program.    The teaching methods part of the  education plan address growth as  an effective teacher by exposure to research  in teaching methods.  The final part seeks to (1) encourage women and other  under-  represented groups to pursue computer science by actively  interacting  with such groups informally and through formal  workshops, and (2) encourage an  ex change between industry and  academia through tutorials and short courses.",
