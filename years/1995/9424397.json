 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424397  Stensrud        Due to nonlinearities in the physics of the atmosphere, deterministic  predictions of the atmosphere have their limitations.  A technique known as  ensemble forecasting is believed to provide a mechanism for improving forecasts of  the atmosphere.  Ensemble forecasting involves running a series of numerical  predictions by changing, within reason, model initial conditions or model physics.   The objective is to provide forecasts that define the range of  possible solutions.   These techniques have shown promise for forecast improvement.        A joint project between the Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale  Meteorological Studies and the University of Colorado is proposed with the  objective to develop and test ensemble forecasting techniques for mesoscale models.   The proposed research will focus upon the difficulties involved in accurately  predicting mesoscale convective weather events.  Three specific objectives of the  research are:  1) to develop a  technique to modify the mesoscale model initial  conditions to define the ensemble group that maximizes the span of model solutions  across the predictability phase space using a minimum number of simulations, while  requiring that the ensemble initial conditions remain constrained to the error  characteristics of the available observations; 2) to explore the results of this  technique for both strongly and weakly forced large-scale environments; 3) to  determine the applicability of using varying model physics in ensemble forecasting  methods..        Knowledge gained from this study will provide necessary information on how  to efficiently produce an ensemble forecast using a mesoscale model.  It is  anticipated that the model results also will provide some guidance on predicting the  model skill for given convective weather events.  ***",
