The technique  involves  low  temperature  measurements  with current flow perpendicular to  the  multilayer  planes,  and is termed CPP-MR. These measurements exhibit  larger  magnetoresistance than analogous in-plane measurements  (CIP-MR),  and  also  provide  more direct access to the  fundamental  spin-  dependent  scattering  parameters and to  the  interface-specific  resistance.   The  research  will  compare  CPP-MR   and   CIP-MR  measurements  on  the same ferromagnetic/non-magnetic  interface.  New  methods have been developed to analyze such data to  extract  fundamental   information   about   magnetic   interfaces.   This  information is also of great current interest in the  context  of  applications of magnetic multilayers in the field of  information  storage technology.  %%%  Non-Technical   Abstract:   Appropriately   fabricated   magnetic  multilayers, composed of alternating layers of magnetic and  non-  magnetic  metals, each only a few atoms thick, have the  property  that  their  electrical  resistance  decreases  drastically  upon  application of a magnetic field. They can thus be used to  detect  very  small magnetic fields. Combined with their small  size  and  fast  response, this capability has made them of interest to  the  recording   industry  for  extracting  information  from   future  generations of higher density magnetic disks and tapes. They also  show  promise  for  use  in determining  position  or  speeds-of-  rotation  of  auto  engine components. This  project  focuses  on  better understanding the fundamental physical phenomena involved,  so  as  to achieve the ability to tailor magnetic multilayers  to  meet specific technological needs. The present research group has  pioneered  unique  techniques for developing  such  understanding.  These  techniques will be further improved  and  applied  to  new  materials in the current project.  ***",
