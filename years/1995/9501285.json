This method is particularly suited for a study  of complex dynamic systems in the middle-to-high frequency  range with moderate -to- large levels of damping such as in  the case of transportation and flight vehicles. The  currently available AMA method is extended to AMA - hybrid  method, which predicts responses of moderately to highly  damped systems. This is a combination of AMA and  perturbation methods that yields physical insights into the  role of modal coupling and damping and closed form  solutions. The educational component includes teaching,  mentoring, outreach, and extension activities aimed at pre  college students, undergraduates, graduate students, and  practicing engineers. Examples include administering a  summer program for high school students, supervising  undergraduate  research projects, mentoring graduate  students, and organizing technical meetings with tutorials  for the exchange of ideas between the academe and the  industry.***",
