 "awd_abstract_narration": "We do not clearly understand what the benefits and costs of group living are for primates generally.   Sex differences may play a role.  In most primate species, females remain in their natal groups for life, whereas males disperse prior to maturity.  Given the prevalence of this female-bonded system, what are the benefits and costs of male group members for females?   The number of males per group varies between and within primate species, but we do not know why.  This dissertation project will examine some short-term benefits and costs of sociality in such a female-bonded primate social system in Costa Rica.  The main benefits proposed for group living are predator protection and improved access to resources, while tha main cost is presumed to be within-group competition.  The study will compare specific behaviors associated with predator defense, resource defense, and resource competition in males and females.  Findings will be related to evolutionary explanations of primate sociality.  Information from the project will enhance our understanding of sociality and its adaptive significance in primates.  The project will also train a very promising young scientist.",
