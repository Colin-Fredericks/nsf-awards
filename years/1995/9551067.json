 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased interest in undergraduate science research justifies  the acquisition of state-of-the-art facilities in order to  attract gifted students toward careers in neuroscience.   Through  this project, histological and neuroimaging equipment are funded  to enable students in the Psychology Department to continue to  investigate the influence of certain variables (e.g., stress,  fetal-alcohol exposure, and environmental enrichment) on the  nervous system.   The new equipment gives students an opportunity  to utilize the most current methodology in their pursuit of  gaining knowledge about the intricacies of the brain.   The  neuroimaging/histological equipment is being used in the  laboratory component of the Physiological Psychology course, a  new Introduction to Behavioral Neuroscience course (yet to be  approved), as well as other Psychology and Biology courses (e.g.,  Cell Biology).   The acquisition of the neuroimaging equipment  can introduce undergraduate psychology majors to the \"wonder\" of  the brain, enhance the chances of undergraduates getting accepted  into graduate neuroscience programs (especially women  undergraduates), and motivate precollege students to consider  studying neuroscience in their academic careers.",
