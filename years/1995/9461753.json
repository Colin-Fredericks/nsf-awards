 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide a technical foundation for the improvement of bioremediation efforts through the use of innovative electrochemical enhancement of the soil microenvironment. In situ engineered bioremediation can be used to reduce or destroy organic contaminants in subsoils quickly, more economically, and with less disruption of operation of the environment than other decontamination methods currently available. The great concern in engineered bioremediation is the absence of contaminant degrading microbes. This proposal describes research that will demonstrate the feasibility of a new in situ electrochemical system that will enhance the soil microbial population thus promoting the more efficient degradation of organic contaminants. Advantages offered by this approach include: (1) contaminant degradation occurs in the subsurface environment; (2) the chemical additives are low cost and environmentally benign; and (3) relatively low capital cost for decontamination of site. Phase I experiments will be conducted using bench scale systems, containing natural soils of varying compositions and characteristics.",
