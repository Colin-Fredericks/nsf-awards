The  host is the Secretary, N. Vittal, of the  Department of Electronics, Government of India.   At the seminar, six leading experts from the US  will give talks and discuss the most  appropriate areas for joint collaboration.   Recent advances in computers/networking are  revolutionizing the process of information  acquisition, composition, publishing,  delivery,learning, and usage.  Large-capacity  storage disks and high-speed fiber-optic  networks are enabling the integration of  diverse media, such as text, audio, and video,  during storage and delivery.  These advances  are stimulating multimedia technologies that  allow several forms of information--journals,  lectures, historic documents, movies, and  newspapers--to be made available to users via  broadband networks. The multimedia sciences  have sparked a number of innovations such as  digital multimedia \"libraries without walls\"  and distance learning.   Scope:  As part of this activity, the DOE will  provide US participants with access to several  DOE laboratories scattered throughout India  where they will be able to investigate  important multimedia S&T research challenges  with their Indian colleagues.  These include  distance learning, computer supported  multimedia collaborative work, and digital  libraries.  This activity is highly beneficial  for the US as they will be interacting with  top-notch researchers in an area of great  importance and strength on the Indian side.              ***",
