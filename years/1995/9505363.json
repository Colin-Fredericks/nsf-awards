The speakers anchored the  meeting and    helped attract  participants from the computer  algebra or computational   scientific/engineering  communities from  the eastern half of the US.  The invited   talks and poster  sessions contributed by the community  covered the breadth of    algebra: algorithms, software, and applications.  The    principle theme of this  l995 meeting was applications.    The purpose of this meeting   was to stimulate  interest in and to  enhance understanding of the technical   aspects of computer  algebra, by providing a way for those in the region who are    active or  interested in becoming more active in computer algebra  to   meet with each other  in an inexpensive and easily accessible  way.",
