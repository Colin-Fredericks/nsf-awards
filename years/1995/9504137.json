 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed computer networks control, scheduling and management  are well-studied topics in scientific and engineering  applications, yet the  problem of finding optimal approaches that  are not too complex to solve or  implement on practical systems  remain unsolved.  Many computer networks are  naturally clustered,  and imbalance of load usually occurs among the clusters  rather  than inside the clusters.  This project will develop clustered  computer  networks' control, scheduling and management policies  for allocating  computational resources across network clusters  and for managing network  operations based on simple network  management protocol(SNMP).  This project  will first develop  clustering model based on the data collected from monitoring  Bradley network loads from real applications.  Then the project  will  investigate and develop adaptive computer algorithms and  heuristic schemes for  developing the control policies.  Finally,  the project will develop network  load monitoring tools based on X-  window and Tcl/Tk for network manager  interface.  The control  schemes developed are expected to be applicable to  network load  balancing and management in many other clustered distributed  systems.    The project is funded under the RUI program.",
