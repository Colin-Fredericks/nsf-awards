 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funding the purchase of field and laboratory  equipment to support environmental education at the university.    The equipment forms the core of the Environmental Instrumentation  Lab (EIL) for use by undergraduates in integrated Environmental  Geology and Biology courses and for B.S.  Thesis research in both  departments.   The EIL provides hands-on experience with the  sophisticated analytical tools commonly used in environmental  investigations.   Undergraduate students learn both abiotic and  biotic analytical field and laboratory methods.   These tools are  used in the characterization, assessment, and  restoration/management aspects of particular sites.   Results  from these investigations are synthesized to provide the basis  for long-term monitoring of the sites studied, thus providing a  real-world approach to environmental investigations that require  ecosystem level analyses.",
