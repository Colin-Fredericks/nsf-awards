 "awd_abstract_narration": "For various reasons, the dynamic nature of living organisms and  processes is not well understood by undergraduate college  students in biology.   That change and movement are the normal,  vital character of living things is not easily taught using  static images in books, slides, preserved specimens, and  photographs.   The development of computers that can capture and  digitize images presents an opportunity to teach the dynamic  aspects of biology in a fundamentally new way.   Through this  project, the university creates 10 microscope/Macintosh  computer-based image analysis workstations that make it possible  for students to capture and analyze images of biological dynamics  in courses in the Department of Biology.   The workstations are  becoming important central tools in the laboratory work of  courses in plant development, animal development, experimental  protozoology, and general microbiology.   These instruments  enable students independently to investigate problems of plant  and animal development as well as movement of micro-organisms in  response to various stimuli.   Students are able to visualize and  comprehend biological phenomena in new ways.   The image analysis  equipment allows them to ask significant biological questions  based on observations and to learn how to use quantitative  approaches to answer questions and problems.   The impact of this  new capability is expected to extend beyond these courses to  other realms of the curriculum as videos and computer files  conveying dynamic, three-dimensional and developmental  representations of living processes are created and used in  teaching.",
