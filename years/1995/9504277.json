 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biological Bulletin, an eclectic, 97-year-old journal  published by the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods  Hole, Massachusetts, will collaborate with the Information  Systems Division of the MBL to produce an electronic companion:  the Biological Bulletin Marine Models Electronic Record (BB--  MMER).   This new journal, distributed via the World Wide Web,  will publish practical information about nonmammalian marine  organisms that are useful in basic biological and biomedical  research.    Marine organisms and the preparations made from them have served  as experimental models for more than a century, and their use has  led to many fundamental discoveries, particularly in  developmental biology, neurobiology, and cellular physiology.  Unfortunately, neither the particulars of collecting,  maintaining, and culturing these organisms, nor the detailed  protocols, recipes, and bibliographies essential to their use in  experimental science, are published in traditional journals due  to limitations of space.  Thus the details that underlie the  findings are lost, or must be rediscovered in different  laboratories.    The BB--MMER will approach this problem in two ways: as a  traditional scholarly journal; and as a novel electronic database  available to scientists everywhere in the world.  First, like its  hard-copy cousin, the BB--MMER will solicit and accept  contributions, and these will be reviewed by the Biological  Bulletin's stable of referees.  All papers accepted for  publication and distributed by the BB--MMER will therefore be  genuine, citable journal articles.    Concurrently, the staff of the MBL's Information Systems Division  will use the Mosaic environment to develop hypertext linkage and  data management features for the journal.  Each BB--MMER  contribution will be presented hierarchically: i.e., first the  title page containing an abstract and a table of contents; then  (by option) the body of the paper, and finally (by option)  step-by-step laboratory protocols and  other detailed materials in  appendices.  Superior illustrations will be provided in color or  black-and-white, and video segments will be included eventually.    Publishing a journal electronically can improve indexing,  retrieval, and multiple use.  Moreover, electronic publishing  enables authors to modify or upgrade previously published work.  But most value is added by the linkage and management features  that are made possible by the electronic environment.  Thus,  users of the BB--MMER will not only be able to obtain  comprehensive information about a large selection of model  organisms and their tissue preparations, but also to compare  protocols, recipes, preparations, or other units of information  called from many different papers.  And this facility will become  more fruitful with time, as the size and complexity of the  database increases.",
