 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been a puzzle as to how Native American inhabitants of high altitude areas have adapted to successful lives in those inhospitable, low oxygen, climates.  Many previous studies have focused on aerobic capacity as an indicator of physical performance, but have ignored adaptations which affect the efficiency of muscular work, which clearly could be a critical factor and might be of tremendous benefit.  Recent research suggests higher work and muscular efficiency values during exercise for high altitude adapted natives.    The major aim of this study will be to determine if such differences exist between highland and lowland Native American populations. A second aim will be to determine the genetic and environmental contributions to variation in work or muscular efficiency.    Subjects will be studied from two environments:  La Paz, Bolivia and Santa Cruz, Bolivia, with 8 different study groups.  This project will also result in expert training for a young scientist.",
