 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417209  Schwartz    A comprehensive program of optical and infrared observations of the  shock wave structure of Herbig-Haro objects (stars) will be carried  out.  A basic aim of the study is to understand the dynamics of           high-velocity jets from young stellar objects and the manner in which  the high velocity material transfers momentum and energy to the ambient  molecular medium.  The fundamental hypothesis is that molecular  hydrogen emission is produced by low-velocity shocks via entrainment by  high-velocity jet material and/or in the extended wings of the bow  shocks in the working surface of a jet penetrating into the molecular  medium.  In both cases, molecular hydrogen is accelerated to  intermediate velocities between those found for optical emission lines  in the high-temperature Herbig-Haro shocks and in the more widespread  carbon monoxide (C0) outflows in which there is momentum coupling.    A major unresolved issue concerns the relation of the optical shocks,  which involve shock velocities greater than about 50 km per second, and  the shocks which produce molecular hydrogen emission which would  require shock velocities less than about 30 km per second.  In many  cases, the optical shocks appear to be coincident spatially with the  molecular shocks, yet it is unlikely that both the optical and the  molecular hydrogen emission arise from a common postshock gas.  High  spatial resolution images of selected Herbig-Haro objects will be  obtained in area of the spectrum of the optical emission lines of  Hydrogen alpha and  SII  and in the infrared lines of molecular  hydrogen and  FeII . The  FeII /(molecular hydrogen) line intensity  ratio can be used to infer the depletion of gas phase heavy elements  onto grains, and thus to determine whether the gas being shocked is jet  gas or ambient medium gas.  The  SII /(Hydrogen alpha) ratio is a  measure of excitation of the gas, and in general the emission from  molecular hydrogen is expected to be strongest in or near structures   with the largest  SII /(Hydrogen alpha) intensity ratio.  For two  optically obscured Herbig-Haro outflows, the 1.64 micron wavelength  line of  FeII  will be used to trace the \"optical\" component of the  shocks.  The acquisition of high resolution spectral data in both the  optical and infrared portions of the spectrum will be used to examine  the radial velocities and velocity dispersions of the postshock gas.  The data should resolve the question of whether the low-excitation  optical emission arises from the same postshock gas as the emission  from molecular hydrogen.  The spatially-resolved spectra will also  permit a discrimination between magnetic precursor and bow shock  models.    In the larger context of star formation, the interpretations of the  observations to be carried out will lend considerable insight into the  question of the origin of bipolar molecular outflows from young stellar  objects.  Recent theoretical models suggest that high-velocity jets  provide the driving power for the more widespread low-velocity  molecular outflows seen in C0 emission.  The study of low-excitation  Herbig-Haro objects and emission from molecular hydrogen found at the  boundaries of the high and low-velocity flows can be used to estimate   the efficiency with which energy and momentum are transferred to the  ambient gas.",
