 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project makes possible the incorporation of more physiology  into traditionally anatomy-based biological sciences laboratories  in order to more effectively tie in laboratory with lectures in  human anatomy and physiology.   Additional physiology is  imperative in order to prepare future health care workers or  future scientists as relates to the assessment and management of  real-life situations concerning the recovery of and maintenance  of homeostasis.  This can be accomplished through the use of  computers and two types of computer software package.    Quantitative Circulatory Physiology (QCP) is a computer that  allows students to challenge people's homeostatic capabilities  through the application of various stressors such as trauma,  exercise, or environmental changes and noting the body's  responses through changes in various cardiovascular, respiratory,  and endocrine parameters.   Physiological data acquisition can  also be accomplished by combining computer software components  with traditional lab equipment.   This setup allows students to  see themselves as models to determine the effects of exercise,  various drugs, etc., on their cardiovascular, respiratory, and  muscular systems.   Ideally, this computer-supplemented  laboratory allows the student to exit a biology course with a  much better understanding of how living organisms interact with  their environment.",
