 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feinman    Under the direction of Dr. Gary Feinman, Mr Andrew Balkansky will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct an  archaeological survey of the Sola Valley which is located in  Oaxaca Mexico. While very little work has been done in the  region, it is known to contain several large sites which include  mounded architecture and carved stelae. Mr. Balkansky and  assistants will aim for 100% coverage of the valley floor. All  sites will be located and surface artifacts such as ceramics and  stone tools will be recovered. On this basis it will be possible  to reconstruct the population history of the valley and determine  how settlement and political organization changed over time.    The Oaxaca region is important to archaeologists because of the  prehistoric state which was centered at Monte Alban and which  arose there. Archaeologists wish to understand how complex  societies arise and through extensive research at the Monte Alban  site it is now possible to trace the development at this core in  some detail. However it is also necessary to understand how this  state expanded and to do this one must look at peripheral areas  such as the Sola Valley. The research which Mr. Balkansky will  conduct will shed new light on the process of state formation and  the strategies employed for state expansion and incorporation of  new regions.    This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new  light on the rise of complex societies. It will provide data of  interest to many archaeologists and assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.",
