 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423192  Davis    Theoretical perspectives in the social sciences have  traditionally treated domestic and international conflict as  independent.  However, the investigators contend that linkages  exist and are important for understanding the dynamics of  conflict at either the domestic or international levels.  Recent  history provides numerous examples of domestic and international  conflict linkages including the Kurdish uprising in Iraq  following the Gulf War, the Argentine invasion of the  Falklands/Malvinas Islands, and the Contra War in Nicaragua.   Yet, do such linkages exist as general patterns of conflict  behavior or are they only manifest during significant events such  as inter-state crises, wars, riots and rebellions?  The current  investigation will answer that question with respect to middle  powers that are undergoing liberalization and/or facing ethno-  nationalist challenges.  It will also help address the weaknesses  that exist within the literature by developing and testing a  dynamic theory of domestic-international conflict linkages.    The project has been underway for one year with support from  Emory University and the Institute for Global cooperation and  Conflict.  During that time the investigators have specified a  theoretical model, developed a coding scheme for collecting  relevant data and begun the data collection on eight cases.   their model builds on work in the international relations  literature that examines conflictual and cooperative behavior  among nation-states.  In addition, the research team makes use of  the recent call for two-level modelling and contend that the  linkage can best be clarified by arguing that domestic groups  hostile to the state, the state itself, and relevant other states  in the international system all monitor, and respond to, one  another's behavior in conflict situations.  In other words, the  investigators develop a modes where the behavior of any of these  actors is argued to be conditioned by the behavior of each of the   other actors.  ***",
