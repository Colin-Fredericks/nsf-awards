This research will  incorporate solvent effects into electronic structure calculations  of proteins.  Simple continuum solvent models are insufficient to  describe phenomena such as hydrogen bonding, local dielectric  perturbations and phenomena involving separations of only a few  water layers.  To model the molecular nature of solvation, the  approach used here will add a statistical mechanical integral  equation theory, previously developed by this group to describe  aqueous solvation of globular molecules, into density functional  electronic structure methods.  %%%  While electronic structure calculations of gas-phase molecules is  a very well developed field, such calculations for molecules in  solution are still in their infancy.  This research will  incorporate solvent effects into electronic structure calculations  of proteins.  Electronic structure calculations are very important  in computational and theoretical biophysics.  For instance, they  are important in gaining a fundamental understanding of the  structure-function relationships of electron transfer proteins and  enzymes.  They are also important in the development of potential  energy function parameters.    ***",
