The objective of the project are to change or consolidate the public's concepts about the fundamental relationships between the environment and technology at the grassroots pocketbook level, to enhance their understanding of the pertinent science and technology, and to provide them with practical information about how to take action for oneself and in the fulfillment of a wider civic responsibility.    The components of the project include:    o Three one-hour prime time television programs  o Community Outreach through the National Community Education Association and their affiliates in 40 states.    o Development of community education material including a 30-minute highlight tape to serve as a discussion springboard with accompanying discussion and resource guides.  o A Viewer's Newsletter for each program which will include short articles on the basic science and technology explored in the program and a \"What You Can Do\" section.  o A CD-ROM for use by parents and children at home and by students in school.  o On-line information clearing house the SOLSTICE, the digital library of energy and environmental resources operated by the Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology.  o Teacher enhancement materials and activities for middle schools to be disseminated through the Teacher Educator's Network of the Association of Science-Technology Centers.  o The National Academy of Engineering will identify engineers who can serve as \"on-line consultants\" to students and teachers involved in examining specific environmental issues.    Richard Thomas, previously Executive Producer for \"Mystery of the Senses\" and \"The World of Chemistry,\" will be PI and Executive Producer.  Principal Content  Advisory will be S.
