 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    The Engineering Coalition of Schools for Excellence in Education and Leadership (ECSEL) will focus on the following which are grouped into the three major programmatic areas:    1. Learning by Design: This task has three main components: (i)Industry-driven, interdisciplinary design projects for upper-level students; (ii) a comprehensive assessment program developed in partnership with industrial allies and professional associations to identify actual knowledge and skill needs of engineers and engineer technicians, and yielding authentic curricular design criteria and (iii) the formation of a new type of collaborative curriculum development and dissemination environment. These components wil be combined with ongoing efforts to expand, enhance, and further validate the design-centered ECSEL experience.    2. Our Role in the K-14 Community: A comprehensive program will be launched to break down the barriers that prevent the infusion of engineering and technology into K-14 curricula, while simutaneously preventing the infusion of talented youth into the engineering and technical workforce.  Engineers, teachers, professional societies, unions, and K-14 educators will work together to create new mechanisms whereby: (i) teachers learn to design alongside engineers; (ii) engineers are provided pathways to become teachers; (iii) doors are opened between engineering and engineering technology programs; and (iv) ECSEL innovations are made available within the richly diverse community college environment.    3. Student and Faculty Development: ECSEL's work in building the infrastructure and human support networks necessary for students and faculty to become effective agents of reform will be bolstered and broadened by a variety of mechanisms, including (i) shared responsibility and leadership in all ECSEL activities, with continued and enhanced leadership roles for our students; (ii) creation of new programs to attract and retain underrepresented groups in the engineering professoriate; and (iii ) exchanges, workshops, and programs for new and veteran faculty to promote ECSEL's theme of learning by design.    The seven members of this Coalition are:   City College of New York   Howard University   Massachusetts Institute of Technology   Morgan State University   Pennsylvania State University   University of Maryland, College Park   University of Washington  ??",
