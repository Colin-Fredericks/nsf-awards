 "awd_abstract_narration": "9452860  Gilbert  The primary focus of this project is dissemination of the best  and most current information on making post-secondary education  in the fields of science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) more  accessible to SEM faculty and to students with disabilities.   Students with disabilities may have difficulty completing certain  SEM course-work tasks independently, (e.g., reading, writing or   manipulating laboratory instruments).  Modern computer-based  technology can provide the needed assistance in many of these  situations.  Students and faculty need to learn about the  existence and potential of this technology.  The American  Association for Higher Education and Project EASI (Equal Access  to Software and Information) propose to conduct an information  dissemination  project to increase the knowledge-base of these  groups thereby increasing inclusion and participation of students  with disabilities in SEM studies.  These students often face  obstacles to SEM studies caused by inaccessible buildings,  computers, laboratmries, information resources, and negative  attitudes of administrators and faculty regarding their abilities  and potential  in SEM studies.  Project EASI has spent the last  six years working to help institutions of higher learning  overcome physical and attitudinal barriers that exist for  students, faculty, and staff with disabilities.  Unfortunately,  despite recent reports and task forces, insufficient work has  been done to distribute the growing amount of research and  information about how adaptive computer technology can help  students with disabilities who want to study and work in the  fields of SEM.  This project will take the best available  information about the application of adaptive technology in SEM  and distribute it to a widely decentralized education audience  through four kinds of dissemination:  electronic, brief print  publications, videos, and live presentations.  The goal of these  efforts is to promote the rapid dissemination of innovat ive  intervention strategies that will increase the participation of  students with disabilities in SEM educational and career  tracks.***",
