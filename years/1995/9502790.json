 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502790  McCalley       The research objective of this project is to develop a risk-  based approach to security assessment in electric power systems  operations.  This objective is motivated by a perception that  today's deterministic approach to security assessment often  results in costly operating restrictions that are not justified  by the corresponding low level of risk.  Use of a risk-based  approach to security assessment is therefore attractive because  it offers the potential to allow operating practices that more  equitable balance the tradeoff between cost and security,  resulting in substantial savings from use of less costly energy  resources.       Development of this risk-based approach is particularly  attractive in today's competitive environment because, unlike the  traditional environment of the regulated, fixed rate of return,  vertically integrated utility, the competitive environment  creates incentives for the multiplicity of players to take risks  in order to maximize their profits.  Unmanaged risk-taking may  very well lead to degradation of security levels; therefore a  carefully framed risk-based security assessment approach would  allow more structured risk management.  The focus of the work  will be to create countours of maximum risk in the space of  critical predisturbance parameters used to characterize system  performance following a contingency.  Particular emphasis will be  placed on security constraints associated with dynamic system  performance.  This work will be carried out in a close  cooperation with engineers from industry.  ***",
