 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510380  Thomsen    These studies will address the biochemical and embryological  function of a set of proteases that regulate, by an unknown  mechanisms, the activity of growth factors in the transforming  growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. The proteases under  investigation are BMP-1 and closely related factors which belong to  a group of metalloendoproteases, the astacins (named after the  first isolate of the group, a crayfish digestive protease). Genetic  studies in Drosophila suggest that an astacin related protease  called tolloid affects the activity of decapentaplegic (dpp), a  ligand in the TGF-beta family. Members of the TGF-beta family have  a wide variety of developmental functions in embryos of vertebrates  and invertebrates. In the development of the amphibian Xenopus,  TGF-beta related factors (e.g. activin, Vg-1 and bone morphogenetic   or BMPs) induce mesodermal tissues and influence body pattern  formation. There is also evidence that the activity of these growth  factors can be regulated at the level of protein processing.  Proteases such as tolloid and a BMP-1 might proteolytically process  and thus activate TGF-beta related proproteins, or indirectly  affect the activity of TGF-beta ligands by proteolytically  inactivating a ligand inhibitor. In Xenopus embryos, BMP-2 and BMP-  4 induce ventral mesoderm (e.g. erythroid blood) and antagonize the  development of dorsal mesodermal tissues. Ectopic expression of  BMP-1 in Xenopus embryos similarly antagonizes the development of  dorsal mesoderm, perhaps by activating BMP ligands which then exert  a ventralizing affect. This grant will focus on the physical and  biological characterization of Xenopus BMP-1 and perhaps other  related astacins. The studies will a) describe the primary cDNA  structure and the expression patterns of Xenopus BMP-1 and  potentially other astacins, b) determine the embryological  activities of BMP-1 and other astacin related factors by ectopic  expression of wild-type (functional) and mutat ed dominant negative  (functionally competitive) versions of the proteins in embryos, and  c) attempt to understand the interaction of astacins and the TGF-  beta related BMPs at the biochemical level, by measuring protease  activity and testing for the formation of protein complexes. The  studies are anticipated to reveal how astacins regulate TGF-beta  ligand activities and whether this is a mechanism to regulate  mesoderm induction and embryonic pattern formation in vertebrates.  ***",
