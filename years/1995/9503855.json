At low to moderate in situ  stress, the unstable  zone location and dimensions are strongly influences by  excavation  geometry, in situ effective stresses, and rock mass  inhomogeneities and  discontinuities.  A rational approach to excavation design,  including  design of support systems, should be based on an  understanding of the  combined effects of these major influences.    This research addresses the problem of determining the size  and shape of  the unstable zone around underground openings in cases where  the block  theory model is appropriate, i.e., hard, jointed rock at low  to moderate  stress levels.  Unstable keyblocks, the dominant failure  mechanism, are  limited in size by two main factors in addition to the  excavation size:  the sizes and shapes of the bounding discontinuities, and  the stabilizing  effect of in situ stress.  This research will be completed  with 1)  development of an analytical model for keyblock size  distribution, 2)  development of characteristic probability density functions  for keyblock  size, 3) combining block theory with stress analysis to  determine maximum  size of unstable keyblocks, and 4) combining 2) and 3) to  develop a  reliability analysis for support systems.    The results of this research will be applicable to  tunneling, mining, and  the development of underground space, as well as to  infrastructure  rehabilitation and safety assessments.  The methods  developed can be  extended to rock slopes and foundations, with significant  cost savings  possible from designs based on objective, consistent and  rational  procedures.",
