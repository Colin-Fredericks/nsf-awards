The first step in the project, A Look at Private Education in  Appalachia, is to determine what technology is currently in place  and how faculty are using it in their classrooms, both for  instruction and research.       The study is expected to show that while many of the  Appalachian colleges and faculty are seriously lacking in the  resources necessary to employ technology to strengthen their  instruction, in far more cases the colleges and their faculty are  on the edge of excellence in their access to and use of technology.   At the end of the study, a college or faculty member will be able  to examine itself or himself in view of what is happening at like  institutions.  The college will be able to determine what is  necessary to strengthen its competitive edge in recruiting and  maintaining students, and the faculty will be able to identify  other faculty across the region who share their interest or who can  strengthen their knowledge and skills.       The final report documenting the results of the study will be  available for dissemination to colleges across the nation who may  also want to prepare for the 21st century.",
