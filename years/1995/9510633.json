 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines how radical political parties become established parties, capable of participating in government.   The principal focus of the research is on the development of the Greens party from a fringe environmental movement to the 3rd largest political party in Germany.  The research explores the interactive relationship between change in party organizational characteristics and participation in governing coalitions.    Political parties in six German states will be compared with respect to their differences in composition, the attitudes of their members and leaders, their organizational structures, and their programmatic activity.  The attitudes of members will be measured with questionnaires distributed to participants at state party  conferences.  Party leaders will be interviewed using an open-ended interview protocols.  In addition to cross-sectional comparisons between states, the evolution of the Green parties within states will be traced.  Organizational changes and coalitional behaviors over time will be mapped to programmatic changes.",
