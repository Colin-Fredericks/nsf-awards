 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze changes in the location  of manufacturing activity in the U.S. between 1963 and 1992 in  order to see whether these changes are influenced by differences  in environmental regulations among states.  The Census Bureau's  longitudinal Research Database provides information at five-year  intervals for all manufacturing plants.  Using these data, each  active plant in each period is categorized as opening, closing,  expanding, or contracting.  These data are aggregated up to the  state-level to create dependent variables such as the number of  newly opened plants in a state during a five year interval.  The  explanatory variables for the estimation include regulatory  measures such as enforcement activity, pollution abatement  expenditures, and state laws, and other factors influencing  location such as taxes, wages, and unionization.  This research  is important because it will develop a new state-level data set  on manufacturing activity, and it will help quantify the impact  of state imposed environmental regulations on the location of  manufacturing activity.",
