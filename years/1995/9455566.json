 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455566  Hamilton  North Seattle Community College proposes a course and curriculum  development project that focuses on developing a year long,  team-taught pre-engineering program titled \"Math and Physics: Tools  for Careers in Engineering.\" The program emphasizes students'  working collaboratively to apply concepts taught in physics and  mathematics to the kinds of problems encountered in the engineering  profession. The proposal entails the planning and integration of an  interactive physics and calculus laboratory into the curriculum.   By scheduling a daily three-hour block, the three faculty members  in physics, calculus and engineering will integrate their course  work in a two-quarter sequence which will provide students with 10  credits in calculus, 5 in engineering physics and 9 in engineering  problems, statics and circuits. The program will be structured to  accommodate students who need remediation in particular skills with  learning assistance. It also will be designed to create a classroom  climate that promotes the pursuit of careers in science and  engineering among women and people of color.  To bring such  significant change to the curriculum, the three faculty  investigators will devote time to curriculum research during the  first of the two-year project. They will consult with two faculty  experienced in developing an interdisciplinary program in science  at The Evergreen State College, Olympia, WA; confer with Professor  Denny Davis at Washington State University who developed a large-  scale engineering curriculum project with DUE support, and visit  model interdisciplinary programs in science and engineering being  developed at other institutions. In developing collaborative, small  group approaches to instruction, they will be guided by the  expertise of the Washington Center for Improving the Quality of  Undergraduate Education, a consortium of 42 colleges and  universities that focus on learning communities as a means of  reforming the undergraduate curriculum.",
