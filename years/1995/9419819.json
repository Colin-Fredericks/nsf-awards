 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal before you requests partial funding for a  PhosphorImager to be used by members of the Departments of Pharmacology  and Molecular Cancer Biology of the Duke University Medical Center. The  proposal describes two major areas of research that join the different  investigators (both major users and minor users), in common pursuit.  First, is the understanding of signal transduction networks in  eukaryotic organisms, particularly in areas related to the cell cycle  and cellular differentiation. Second, is the understanding of the  structure, function and regulation of eukaryotic genes.              The elucidation of the networks of intracellular signalling in  eukaryotes will be accomplished by work on a variety of organisms. The  work of Drs. Garrett and Lew addresses issues of cell cycle regulation  and differentiation in the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dr.  Means uses Aspergillus nidulans to address the importance of calcium  binding proteins in signalling. Xenopous laevis oocytes and mammalian  cell lines are used by Drs. Bell, Pendergast, Shenolikar, Swenson and  Wang to elucidate signalling pathways with an emphasis on the  importance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Dr. Casey also  uses mammalian cell lines to unravel the signalling mediated by small G  proteins,. The precise regulation of intracellular signalling is  modulated by subtle changes in multiple pathways. Reliable  quantification of these changes has been difficult, if not impossible,  to document using autoradiographic techniques. PhosphorImager  technology is the standard for this quantification and the studies  described in the proposal require ready acces to this technology.              The study of gene structure and expression has resulted in some of  the most dramatic revolutions in modern biology. Work to understand the  transcription regulation of gene expression following cellular  activation is ongoing in the laboratories of Drs. Horowitz, McDonell,  Pendergast, and Wang. Dr. Gar cia-Blanco has focused his research on the  mechanism and regulation of pre-mRNA processing in mammalian cells and  in Drosophila melanogaster. The regulation of DNA synthesis as an  integral decision of cycling cells is investigated in Xenopous laevis  oocytes by Dr. Kornbluth. All of these projects require precise  quantification of specific macromolecules, which is best done using  radiolabel and PhosphorImager technology.              This dynamic and productive group of investigators needs this  technology in order to continue an outstanding program of research. In  the proposal it is explained how this instrument will benefit the group  and the institution.",
