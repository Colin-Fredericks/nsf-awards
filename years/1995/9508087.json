 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508087  Lehman    Differences in availabilities and rates of supply of  phosphorus to the ecosystems of the Great Lakes of North  America are known to be major factors controlling rates of  productivity, biomass development, and species composition.  Nonetheless, epilimnetic concentrations of phosphate are  uniformly low in all the Great Lakes during summer, and  radiotracer studies demonstrate that turnover times of the  ambient pools are minutes to tens of minutes, as the result  of biological processes.  In situ concentrations during the  productive summer months have generally proven intractable  to accurate measurement, but it appears that,  in common  with oceanic observations of ammonium dynamics, bacteria  dominate fluxes at ambient levels, whereas phytoplankton  dominate when concentrations are modestly increased.  There  are differences between turnover dynamics and equilibrium  partitioning of tracer P in Great Lakes of differing trophic  condition, and along inshore-to-offshore gradients within  individual Great Lakes.  The main hypothesis to be tested in  this research is that the relative magnitudes of microbial  recycling processes, and of P recycling by zooplankton,  change predictably with overall primary production, and with  an index of P deficiency, such that different proportions of  recycled P are incorporated by algae versus bacteria in  different lakes.  This research effort will combine explicit  kinetic models for P fluxes with experiments designed to  quantify the relative contributions of bacterial, protozoan,  and metazoan recycling rates in Lakes Erie, Huron and  Michigan.  A new analytical method adapted from sea water  for fresh water investigations (magnesium inducted  coprecipitation of P) now makes tractable the investigation  of P dynamics and regeneration rates by is tope dilution  methods.",
