 "awd_abstract_narration": "Programmable Calculators with a computer link are now affordable for individual student use. It is possible to design calculator software that transforms these calculators into personal computers for every elementary school student to use as conveniently as a textbook. Programs can be stored on a computer disk and are easily loaded into a class set of calculators to meet individual or class lesson needs. The advantages of computer aided instruction are accessible to every student for school and home use. Early age student use of this individual technology, parent involvement at home and better open ended problem solving are now possible. CalcuSoft, Inc. proposes initially to develop calculator software for fourth grade mathematics by linking our pilot test in one classroom to six more classrooms, funded by this Phase I research project. The outcomes will guide development of their product and a Phase II proposal that includes applications in science and special education.",
