 "awd_abstract_narration": "As parallel computing is becoming a cost effective way to achieve  large performance gains, these high performance computing systems  are changing the nature of research and development across all  areas of science and engineering.   However, skilled scientists  are needed to exploit the opportunities that parallelism  presents, which mandates that the university modify its cur-  riculum to teach computer science, engineering, and other science  students to use this new technology effectively.    This grant  enables the university to establish a parallel computing  laboratory in the Department of Computer and Information  Sciences.   The project focuses on building a farm and a  dedicated cluster of isolated workstation-class microprocessors,  which enable students to exploit various paradigms of parallel  computing and provide accurate performance feedback.   This  laboratory creates the necessary environment for a sophomore-  level foundations course in parallel computing.   It also allows  for the integration of parallelism into existing core, and  advanced, computer science courses, as well as other science and  engineering courses.",
