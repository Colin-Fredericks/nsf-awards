 "awd_abstract_narration": "The difficulty in developing reliable software has been an  obstacle in  using distributed systems. This project will study and advance the  use of formal techniques in distributed protocol design. The objective is to develop a  framework which allows a complex protocol to be  structured as a composition of  simpler protocols. The project will  develop notations for specifying the  interactions between the  component protocols, develop a proof system, and build  a software  tool supporting our methodology. The framework will be applied to  various domains such as design of adaptive protocols,  reconfigurable protocols,  and structuring of control protocols.    The educational component of the CAREER  prooject will involve students in the  protocol development. This will include  emphasis of formal techniques in  courses, increasing  laboratory component to  provide experience and forming  alliances with the  industry to re-train  computer professionals (via  television courses), and involving undergraduates  in research.",
