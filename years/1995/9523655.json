Current  research is focused on extending this insight  to the  atomic  level properties of systems undergoing chemical  change. The  Gordon Research Conference entitled Dynamics at  Surfaces provides a  unique opportunity for students to  interact with leaders  in  this active  field  and to delve  into frontier questions of  atomic  scale growth and energy  transfer. The Dynamics at Surfaces conference  will provide  a  unique  opportunity to bring  together  researchers  with  diverse  backgrounds and expertise in subspecialties  that  currently have  common  meeting venue. The availability of  one-on-one  contact time  is critical to foster the  development of rewarding interactions between  researchers  in areas of laser spectroscopy,  scanning  probe microscopy,  film  growth,  and other dynamical  aspects  of  surface  reactions.      %%%      The  Gordon Research Conference entitled Dynamics at  Surfaces provides a  unique opportunity for students to  interact with leaders  in  this active  field  and to delve  into frontier questions of  atomic  scale growth and energy  transfer.",
