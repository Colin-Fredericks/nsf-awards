 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electric drives, which are composed of electric machines supplied  by power electronic converters, are an integral part of  high-performance and high-efficiency electromechanical systems  used in manufacturing automation and many industrial processes,  as well as in consumer products and transportation systems.   The  increased performance and energy efficiency of processes and  products that utilize electric drives combined with the steadily  decreasing cost of power and micro electronics promise to  accelerate the use of these systems.  Consequently, the demand  for engineering graduates familiar with electric drives is sure  to grow.  Motivated, in part, by this demand the university has  moved to strengthen this area of undergraduate study.   This  project implements an Electric Machinery and Drives Laboratory  (EMDL).   This facility is a multipurpose educational laboratory  for examining fundamental principles of electric machinery in a  junior-level course and the analysis and design of electric  drives in a senior-level course.   The equipment used in the EMDL  includes fractional horsepower electric machines, power  electronic converters, microcmmputers, and data acquisition  systems.   Juniors using the EMDL are able to use an innovative  \"Field Observer\" to visualize the magnetic fields within  operating machines and study the transient response of machines  experimentally and using PSPICE simulation.   Seniors using the  EMDL are able to study the operation of electric drives and  experiment with new control strategies.",
