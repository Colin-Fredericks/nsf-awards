 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I proposal is directed at the pulp and paper industry. The use of recycled paper fibers is growing rapidly, yet the properties of the pulp created from secondary fibers varies greatly. This project addresses the problem by control of the refining process. Since mixed secondary paper waste changes continuously as new material is fed into the process stream, an on-line control strategy is needed. This program will provide critical information on processing versus property relationship and will produce a control algorithm for the on-line modification of the refining process. Other objectives of the project are the identification of suitable sensor technology to provide process data, and the identification of equipment that can operate under the potentially harsh conditions.  The research will focus on experimental data that will establish the process and property relationship of the refining conditions and the resultant secondary paper pulps. Recycled pulp will be evaluated for numerous properties both prior to and following treatment, in either single or recirculated mode through the refiner.  Anticipated results are that the properties of secondary paper pulp can be controlled in real-time by the proposed process. Equipment control algorithms will be developed that can aid the secondary paper pulp industry in improving the strength and consistency of secondary paper fiber pulps.",
