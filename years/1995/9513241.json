 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed effort during 1995-1996 is to 1) study the locations  and size distribution of magnetospheric ducts, 2) greatly improve  current estimates of loss rates of radiation belt electrons due to  VLF waves from lightning, chorus, and other coherent waves, 3)  clarify the relative roles of ducted and non-ducted whistler mode  waves in the diffusion and precipitation of radiation belt  particles, and 4) study the mechanisms responsible for high  latitude precipitation bursts.  This study will be based on  precipitating electron records acquired in 1982 by the SEEP  (Stimulated Emission of Energetic Particles) satellite and by VLF  wave receivers on the ground and on satellites.  Electron  precipitation by ducted whistlers and by other VLF waves is thought  to be the major loss mechanism for radiation belt electrons.   However, the relative importance of ducted whistlers, unducted  whistlers, chorus, and hiss is controversial.  The SEEP satellite  with its low altitude orbit, large geometric factor detectors, and  high data collection rates has acquired an unique data set which  can be used to address these issues.  In addition, VLF wave data  from ground stations and satellites were obtained during the time  interval SEEP was operating and will be used to associate wave  characteristics with the particle precipitation.  This work will  improve knowledge of magnetospheric duct dimensions, will provide  quantitative information on the fine structure of lightning-induced  electron precipitation and on the number of electrons precipited by  ducted whistlers, should give information on the precipitation  rates caused by non-ducted whistlers and other VLF emissions.   Analysis of the high resolution electron data should also constrain  the possible mechanisms responsible of the high latitude electron  precipitation bursts.",
