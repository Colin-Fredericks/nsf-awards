 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will acquire and operate instruments for a high-throughput  automated plant molecular genetics facility. The facility will comprise  of an automated DNA sequencer, a DNA extraction robot, a laboratory  workstation, a thermocycler, a phosphoimager, and supporting computers.  The facility will primarily provide three areas of research support:  DNA sequencing, quantitative analysis of gene expression, and genetic  analysis.       The facility will impact at least 24 productive research programs  in nine departments that study plant molecular genetics, ranging from  fundamental molecular genetics on model species to applied crop  improvement programs. We are currently severely limited by the lack of  this instrumentation. All these studies would benefit from this  facility. Several experiments are impossible without it. Reliable  generation of accessible DNA sequence data is a fundamental component  for many biological investigations, particularly gene identification  and characterization. Accurate measurement of gene expression is  critical to studies on gene function. Molecular markers have now been  developed for most of the species under study; these should now be  utilized. This facility will allow a scale of experimentation that  would be otherwise impossible in an academic setting. Automated DNA  extraction as well as template preparation and analysis will allow  large numbers of samples to be run with accuracy.       Both the UC Davis Office of Research and the College of  Agriculture and Environmental Sciences are committed to developing this  facility as demonstrated by their level of financial support. Their  contribution, together with that from Keygene, constitutes a 50% match  to the amount requested from NSF. The College will provide technical  support for a total of five years, two years beyond the funding period.       We will continue to develop and apply efficient molecular marker  technologies. In particular, we are collaborating with Applied  Biosystems to analyze Ampli fied Fragment Length Polymorphisms as  codominant markers on their instruments. This will increase the utility  of their machines and allow hundreds of markers to be analyzed on many  individuals. It will also reduce the generation of radioactive waste.",
