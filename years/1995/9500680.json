The existing tools, which provide critical information for  most formation evaluations, pose risks to the environment and to  the personnel that operate and transport them.  The overall  objective of the project is to perform the research required to  develop a novel electrical x-ray instrument for the measurement of  bulk formation density and lithology (composition) in MWD  applications.  The specific technical objectives of the project  are:  (1) to modify the Phase I device to experimentally  demonstrate reliable electron beam operation at high energies; (2)  to improve the basic geometry of the x-ray density/lithology  logging tool in order to maximize its performance; (3) to design  and construct a high energy laboratory prototype x-ray logging  tool; (4) to measure the performance characteristics of the  laboratory prototype x-ray system; and (5)  to experimentally  evaluate the high energy MWD    x-ray tool in simulated formations.   Sperry-Sun Drilling Services, a leader in the MWD field and a Phase  I contributor, will participate under Objectives 2, 3 and 5.  If  successful, this project will provide a new type of MWD  density/lithology logging tool with performance parameters  comparable to, or exceeding, those of radioactive tools.  However,  it will eliminate the risks  associated with the radioactive  material in existing tools.  ***",
