 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417776  This award supports research on recently collected  fossils from Seymour Island in the Antarctic Peninsula.  The Earth's high latitude regions are very sensitive to  global perturbations.  A close examination of the  geologic record from these regions of the Earth can  provide important insight into past global climatic  events.  Examination of the fossil record from the high  southern latitudes clearly indicates increased stresses  on the biosphere during the latest Cretaceous, but prior  to the K/T mass extinction event.  The excellent  paleontological record on Seymour Island provides new  and important insights into events in the high southern  latitudes at the end of the Cretaceous.    The Cretaceous/Tertiary sequence exposed on Seymour  Island, Antarctica is unique in several respects.  It is  appears to be characterized by relatively rapid and  nearly-continuous deposition of mid- to outer-shelf  sediments across the boundary.  In contrast to other K/T  boundary sections, the Seymour Island sequence contains  abundant and well-preserved macro and micro faunas and  floras from the Campanian into the Paleocene and  provides an unparalleled opportunity to study the biotic  changes of marine benthic fauna prior, during, and  following the terminal Cretaceous extinction event.  It  also provides an opportunity to compare the faunal  changes from the high southern latitudes with the  worldwide Late Cretaceous biotic crisis.    The objectives of this are to analyze the fossil  material collected during joint Argentine-US field work  in early 1995 and to complete the ongoing taxonomic  study of the molluscan fauna material obtained during  previous U.S. sponsored expeditions and previous joint  Argentine-U.S. expeditions.    During the highly successful joint U.S./Argentine  expedition to Seymour Island this past austral summer,  approximately 3,500 lb. of fossils and sediment samples  for microfossil and geochemical studies were collected.  The initial phase of our work during the comin g year  will focus on curating the fossil material and the  preparation of sediment samples that will be sent to  those scientists that have expressed an interest in  working on the material from Seymour Island.  In  addition to work on the samples, field observations  (geologic data and fossil localities) will be plotted on  the new USGS topographic maps.  This phase of our data  analysis is tedious and time consuming and is projected  to take approximately 12 months.  Initial results from  the field season this year will be presented at the  Antarctic Symposium on Geology and Geophysics in  September 1995 in Italy.",
