 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hans Andersen of Stanford University is supported by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study computer   simulations of chemical and materials systems.   Andersen's research will   focus on new computer simulation approaches to chemical and materials   systems.  Four major areas of research will be pursued:1) Quantum theory   of reaction rates of both condensed and gas phase chemical species; 2)   Computer simulation studies of melting in two dimensional arrays of   colloidal particles; 3) Theory of interaction of charged colloidal   particles in aqueous ionic solution; and 4) Methods for ab initio   computer simulation of materials including the use of new   pseudopotentials, an improved density functional method, and the use of   wavelets for basis functions.  Computer simulations of chemical systems have provided chemists with many   new physical insights related to the elucidation of  chemical properties   in atomic and molecular terms.   As the models continue to improve, the   predictions of such models become increasingly reliable.  As   computational capabilities continue to improve, the size of systems which   can be reliably treated continues to increase.  Andersen's research is   directed at the simulation of systems which are of chemical and material   importance many of which exhibit quantum effects and cannot be treated by   ordinary classical simulation techniques.  Andersen will develop new   computational approaches which will facilitate the treatment of such   systems.",
