 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512009  Altonji  The question of whether private schools are more effective than  public schools is at the center of the current national debate  over the role of vouchers, charter schools, and other reforms  that would increase choice in education.  The question has been  the subject of much controversy among researchers.  If private  schools do in fact provide better education at lower cost, then  the case for expansion of choice in schooling is strengthened.   Since Catholic schools account for about two thirds of private  school enrollment in the U.S., assessing the effectiveness of  Aatholic schools is an important part of the assessment of  private schooling.  The disagreement surrounding the effects of  Catholic schools on achievement scores and other outcomes centers  around the problem of nonrandom selection into Catholic schools.  This project will investigate how Catholic school effects vary  with individual characteristics such as race, gender, parental  education, family income, and with neighborhood characteristics  and school characteristics.  The project will address the  selection problem for Catholic schools by taking advantage of the  fact that proximity to Catholic schools has a strong effect on  the probability of Catholic school attendance for Catholics but  not for non-Catholics.  This permits the use of the interaction  between religious preference and proximity to Catholic schools to  statistically identify Catholic school effects.      Separate controls for both proximity and religious preference  will be used.  The approach will be implemented using the  National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972,  which reports zipcode of resident, and the Panel Study of Income   Dynamics, which reports Census tract.  The project will take  advantage of an education supplement in the 1995 PSID the  provides information about type of school attended and the  extension of the PSID  geocode  data through 1994.  The panel  data sets will be matched to information on th e neighborhood and   community, local public schools, and the distance to and  characteristics of the nearest Catholic schools.  Various  instrumental variables and  control function  estimators will be   used to estimate Catholic school effects, with the interaction  between religious preferences and proximity as the key exogenous   variable.",
