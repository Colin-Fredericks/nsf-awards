 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453088  Rogers    Project EDGE--Eliminating Discrimination by Gender in Education -- is an experimental, multi-  level mentoring project that targets young women at key educational transition points, along with  pre-college teachers, counselors, and university faculty.  The overall goal is to encourage and  support the interest in, and the retention of more young women in science, engineering, and  mathematics (SEM) by increasing the frequency, consistency, and coherence of positive  experiences and messages about participation in these fields.  To accomplish this goal, the  Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) proposes a tiered approach to address several issues that  have been identified by research as key events that discourage young women in SEM fields.   Project EDGE focuses on these issues by making systemic changes in instructional styles of  teachers, connecting young women's learning about SEM fields with real-life career experiences,  and sharing resources and data with others.    Project EDGE recognizes current research which identified teachers as the \"first line of attack\"  for addressing the problems of classroom equity.  The project seeks to sensitize the secondary  teachers, counselors and university faculty, who interact so closely with young women, to the  pedagogical practices that promote gender equity, provide collaborative learning opportunities,  and expand their interface with the current professional SEM world.  The project provides  ongoing mentoring and support to provide role-modeling and exposure to successful professional  SEM women for young women in high school and the first year of college.  Mentoring  relationships are developed with:  professional women working in SEM careers with regard to  career information and life style choices; teachers, who are involved in instructional development  and support groups; and, peers and other students involved in the project.  Throughout the  project, students have many opportunities to communicate informally with women  in SEM  careers through a series of face-to-face activities complementing on-going communication taking  place via distance learning technologies and data networks.  Thus, based upon RIT's encouraging  experience with a pilot program of this type, the proposal expands the concept to reach more  young women and develops a comprehensive, longitudinal study to explore the pedagogical,  institutional, and support issues involved in promoting women's participation in SEM fields.   The project also seeks to share results and processes through information networking and  dissemination designed to encourage replication of the project in other communities.  ***",
