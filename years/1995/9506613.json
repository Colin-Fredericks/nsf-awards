 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506613  Cormier    This grant provides $16,625 as partial support for an upgrade to  the computing facilities of the geophysical research group at the  University of Connecticut, Storrs.  The University will provide  an equal amount for the upgrade.  The geophysics computing  facility is the principal research facility for 2 geophysics  faculty (Vernon Cormier and Roelof Versteeg) and their students  working in the areas of deep Earth structure, seismic wave  propagation, seismic processing and inversion and environmental  geophysics.. The facility also serves geology faculty (Tim Byrne)  as the main computational resource for modeling regional  tectonics, and serves faculty and graduate students in general as  the-computational platform for Mathematica.  The PI, Cormier is  one of the leading minds in theoretical seismology and the co-PI,  Byrne is a leading expert in the tectonics of Japan.  Specifically, the upgrade will consist of a central UNIX server  (Sparc 20) with large memory and 3 Mac Power PC's, which will  serve both as X-terminals and as standalone units. This equipment  will improve this group's ability to conduct simultaneous  research on problems in deep Earth structure, visualization,  modeling and inversion of geophysical data for problems in  environmental remediation and regional tectonics (e.g. plate  reconstructions and deformation simulations).  All purchased  equipment will be completely compatible with existing equipment  and will strongly improve the present computational and  visualization capabilities.    ***",
