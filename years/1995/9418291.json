Spore formation in the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis  represents a simple example of cellular development that has been  well characterized morphologically, physiologically and  genetically.  Interestingly, this prokaryote has certain  similarities to development in higher organisms.  Most notable is  the formation of two cell types during the course of sporulation.   These two cell types (of which one is destined to become the spore)  are, at first, separated by only two layers of membrane and are  thus reminiscent of the compartmentalized structures found in  eukaryotic cells, (e.g., mitochondria).  Similarly, adjacent  daughter cells in a multicullular differentiating organism are  separated by only two membrane layers. B. subtilus may be able to  serve as a simple model to address how information is communicated  throught membranes.  In this proposal the structure and function of  an extremely small developmental protein, SpoVM, will be  determined.  The 26 amino acid, 3kD, SpoVM protein is crucial for  the development of B. subtilis and is able to interact with  phospholipid membranes.  The hypothesis is that SpoVM is involved  in intercompartmental communication between the mother and daughter  cells. This proposal will investigate the nature of the cell-cell  communication process and the role that SpoVM may play.  The  specific aims are: to isolate suppressors of a spoVM mutant, to  determine the cellular location of the protein, to determine  whether it is an oligomer, to examine its structure by CS  spectroscopy and NMR, to carry out liposome binding and channel  conductance experiments, to search for interacting proteins, to  identify regions of functional importance and to screen for  homologues in other spore-forming bacteria.****",
