Chatter limits the machining productivity and affects the surface  quality.  It also causes loss of dimensional accuracy of the  workpiece and accelerates the premature failure cutting failure.   The proposed research is to investigate the process behavior and  develop models to control chatters by using the Spindle Speed  Variation (SSV) method.    In the proposed work, the University of Illinois at Urbana -  Champaign will investigate the relationships among the variable  spindle speed trajectory parameters and the dynamics response of  the machining condition, and develop the speed selection criterion  based on the steady state vibration level.  The University of  Michigan will develop and validate chatter model using a  difference-differential equation to suppress chatter via spindle  speed variation.  This will be a two-year joint effort.  This  research aims to combine the individual strengths of each program,  integrated existing technologies, and develop new tools and methods  in a cooperative manner to solve critical problems in chatter  suppression.",
