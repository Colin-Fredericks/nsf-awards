The Center will continue to develop research activities and to  advance the state-of-the-art understandings on grinding through  several major core fundamental research activities:1.) Vibration,  Control, and Dynamics; 2.) Truing and Dressing; 3.) Grinding  Fluids; 4.)Materials and Surfaces.  In addition, the Center will  continue to develop testbed research projects in cooperation with  its company members to conduct the proof-of-concept implementation  and prtotyping.    The Center currently has 13 industrial members.  In the past few  years, the Center has established a strong research program and has  achieved tremendous success in terms of research, technology  transfer, industrial collaboration, and spin-off activities.   Through the Center's activities, university faculty, and students,   industrial members have enjoyed a very close and mutual beneficial  working relationship.  This University of Connecticut requests a  one year renewal of the Center to capitalize on these success and  help expand the impact onto other U.S. manufacturing industries.",
