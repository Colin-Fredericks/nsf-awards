The results of this study will provide an increased understanding of the regulation of cell-cell interactions through proteolytic processing of the extracellular matrix.  %%%  This project will study the influence of cell surface molecules on  sperm and egg interactions during fertilization using frog cells.  The DNAs for an enzyme which hydrolyzes proteins, a protease called ovochymase, and its extracellular protein substrate, will be cloned.  The extracellular location of ovochymase before and after fertilization will be determined.  This information will provide a means to understand how cell-cell interactions are regulated by modification of cell surface molecules.  ***",
