 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our goal is to develop both a theoretical and practical  foundation for teacher professional development -- with particular  relevance to teachers of culturally and linguistically diverse  children -- that combines ongoing teacher inquiry in science with  classroom-based inquiry on learning and teaching.  The research  will consist of analysis of a corpus of videotapes of a teacher  research group and the teachers' classrooms collected over the past  three years as part of our prior RTL project on the interplay  between scientific and everyday discourses in Haitian Creole and  Spanish bilingual classorooms.  Interatively applying methods of  discourse analysis to this courpus, we will develop two studies of  teacher learning, one in evolution and one in experimentation and  argumentation, in order to characterize what and how the teachers  are learning about science, student learning, and classroom  practice. in a final monograph, we will set forth a model of  professional development based on our findings.",
