 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sabloff    Under the direction of Dr. Jeremy Sabloff, Ms. H. Hope Henderson  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct  archaeological excavation at the Mayan site of K'axob which is  located in lowland Belize. The site includes components from both  the Formative and Classic periods and therefore documents the  transition from egalitarian to larger more complex stratified  society. The residential portion of K'axob includes a large  number of mounds which represent both single and multifamily  dwellings. Ms. Henderson will excavate a sample which includes  each type and each time period. On the basis of the lithic  remains, the ceramics and the faunal materials she will  reconstruct the range of activities conducted. This will permit  her to determine variability within each time period and to  examine change across time.     In recent years archaeologists have learned that most activities  in prehistoric societies were conducted on a household level and  that these units provided the main productive units. They have  hypothesized how household activity changes as societies increase  in size and grow more complex. Some theories postulate  specialization across households while other archaeologists have  suggested that the reverse occurs and the number of roles taken  within households increases. Given K'axob's time span and the  ease with households can be excavated, the site provides an  excellent context to examine this question.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will yield new  insight into the development of complex societies and will assist  in the training of a promising young scientist.",
