 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418181  Miller  The research will employ Fe and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase  (SOD) as a model system and exploit the unique ability of nuclear  magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to directly observe protein  groups and monitor structure in solution.  The objectives are to  elucidate the conformational interplay between the metal ion site  and the protein of SOD upon substrate analog binding to the metal  ion, and to determine why FeSOD protein is inactive with Mn bound  instead of Fe, and MnSOD protein is inactive with Fe bound instead  of Mn.  Isotope edited NMR will be used in conjunction with amino  acid-specific isotopic labeling to produce drastically simplified  spectra showing signals of labeled amino acids only.  Comparisons  of spectra of SOD with and without the substrate analog azide bound  will identify amino acids affected by azide binding and indicate by  what mechanisms the protein is conformationally responsive to  events at the metal ion.  By monitoring amino acids at the  interfaces between domains or subunits, it will be possible to  determine whether the conformation change involves potentially  general mechanisms for conformational change including (1) relative  motions of domains bridged by the metal ion, (2) relative motions  of subunits and (3) propagation of conformational effects via  hydrogen bonding networks.  These studies build on the known  structure for SOD and exploit the unique ability of NMR to directly  observe protons, provide information on their participation in  hydrogen bonds and provide qualitative and quantitative   information on both structure and dynamics of proteins in solution  unconstrained by crystal packing.  The work will also determine why  SODs containing the wrong metal ion are inactive, by evaluating  their competence for individual elements of catalysis including  each of the half reactions, the reduction midpoint potential,  proton donation, substrate analog binding and active site  structure, thus specifying the chemical reaso n for catalytic  incompetence.  Site-directed and random mutagenesis will be used to  convert MnSOD protein into a FeSOD.  Characterization of these SODs  will reveal what amino acid changes are important, the extent to  which these amino acid changes support activity with the wrong  metal, and at what cost to activity with the correct metal.  %%%  Metalloenzymes combine the reactivity of metal centers with the  exquisite specificity and control of enzymes.  The Fe-containing  superoxide dismutases (FeSODs) and the homologous Mn-containing  superoxide dismutases (MnSODs) are metalloenzymes that catalyze the  conversion of superoxide to dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide.  SOD is  relatively small, very stable and soluble but also embodies two  central features of metalloenzyme catalysis:  the metal site and  the protein are believed to affect each other's structure, and each  type of SOD, while able to bind either Fe or Mn, is only active  with one.  Thus, the structure and activity of the enzyme reflect  interactions between the protein and the metal ion, and these  interactions are metal ion specific.  The goal of the research is  (1) to determine how much of the protein is affected by binding of  small molecules to the metal ion, and (2) to describe the protein  structural change in terms of relative movement of the modules that  make up the protein structure.  The work will also determine why  MnSOD protein is not active with Fe bound and FeSOD protein is not  active with Mn bound.  This new understanding of the protein-metal  cooperation that is necessary for metalloenzyme catalytic activity  will advance ongoing efforts to design or modify metalloenzymes to  catalyze useful reactions in drug synthesis, waste detoxification  and chemical sensors.  ***",
