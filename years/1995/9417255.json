 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support  for a three year project to continue  an on-going study of time-dependent processes of Antarctic ice  sheet snow accumulation and transport dynamics, using a recently  developed system which automatically disperses colored glass  microspheres onto the snow surface at 14 day intervals.  The  microspheres act as both a time marker and tracer within the snow  profiles.  Currently, two units are deployed on the Ross Ice  Shelf near automatic weather stations.  After another year of  operation at the existing sites they will be moved and operated  for two years at an automatic weather station site influenced by  strong katabatic winds and an automatic geophysical observatory  facility on the polar plateau, where precipitation and wind-blown  snow characteristics are very different from coastal regions.  This research will combine experimental and modeling approaches  to try to understand the processes controlling snow accumulation  and wind-driven transport of snow.",
