 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Laboratory for the Simulation and Experimentation with  Electronic Devices (SEED) is designed for freshman students in  the dual-degree engineering program (DDP) and for science  students from chemistry, physics, biology, and environmental  science.   It is hands-on, multidisciplinary, project-driven, and  team-based.   It focuses on the design of functional module  assemblies that interface various data acquisition devices with  the computer for simulation and analysis.   SEED surveys  micro-electronics, functional modules, and prototype boards.    Multidisciplinary project development is a major component of  SEED: teams design the signal acquisition system starting with  the probe and ending with the computer.   The students gather the  data and use the computer to analyze it and simulate the system's  dynamics.   The students deal with the macro-aspect of the  designs rather than the in-depth electronic treatment of the  separate components.   Various issues, such as compatibility,  resonance, feedback, impedance matching, and analog-to-digital  conversions, are explored.   The SEED lab also enhances the  existing electronics laboratory and transforms it into an  advanced instrumentation lab.   It will play an instrumental role  in alleviating the current DDP's retention problem by adding an  element of excitement to the lower-level curriculum and will set  the tone for the whole program.   SEED will also affect some of  the advanced science laboratories in which measurement, and not  only analysis, is computer-based.   SEED, a DDP requirement and a  science recommended elective fulfilling a lab degree requirement,  supports five different stations (3 students per station); it  directly involves 60 students during its first 2 years of  operation.",
