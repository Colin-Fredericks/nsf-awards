 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peck       In this multidisciplinary project, the investigator at Ithaca  College and his colleagues Guckenheimer and others at Cornell  University focus upon studies of the stomatogastric ganglion.  This  small neural network with approximately 30 neurons is a central  pattern generator that coordinates movement of the gastric mill  and pylorus of crustacea.  The investigators construct  compartmental models of individual neurons based upon experimental  measurements and amalgamate these into models for subnetworks.  These systems provide a testbed for the development of algorithms  to explore the bifurcations of dynamical systems.  Particular  attention is given to those aspects of the systems that involve  multiple time scales.       The goal of the project is to improve understanding of  dynamical processes in biological systems, with an emphasis upon  neural systems.  The investigators work in a multidisciplinary  setting, combining experiment and mathematical modeling, giving  due attention to both mathematics and neuroscience, and ensuring  that the two interact at all times in the work.  The larger goals  are pursued in the context of specific systems, namely the study  of a small neural circuit that controls rhythmic motions in the  foregut of lobsters.  This model system has been chosen for its  modest size and accessibility for experimental manipulation.  The  project aims to understand how neural systems switch among motor  patterns and how they regulate these patterns.",
