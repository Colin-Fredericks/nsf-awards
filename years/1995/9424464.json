 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jerome       The investigator studies semiconductor devices, focusing on  the simulation and mathematical analysis of the hydrodynamic and  quantum hydrodynamic models for such devices.  Microwave and  multi-species models, and the decisive role of friction, are  emphasized in the classical studies, and hysteresis,  bistable-state analysis, are emphasized in the quantum studies.  The rationale is to establish a way of dealing with various  aspects of hot electron effects in classical structures, and the  effects of tunneling and repulsion in heterogeneous structures, or  compound semiconductors.  The algorithms to be employed for the  simulations are shock capturing algorithms of finite difference  and finite element type.  The multi-species models permit  simulation of the circuit involving the Gunn diode, and its three  valley electron carriers, by new hydrodynamic models.  These are  compared with the computationally intensive results obtained by  the Urbana group, via Monte Carlo simulation of the Boltzmann  equation.       Mathematical and computer models of semiconductor devices  have increasingly necessitated the incorporation of two types of  effects: (1) energetics, often called the hot electron effect, and  (2) small scale, or quantum mechanical, effects.  This proposal  describes two important models, the first based upon classical,  and the second upon quantum, physics.  Although the basic physical  laws have been understood for at least seventy-five years, the  efforts to apply these laws to semiconductor devices in a way that  allows for reasonably efficient modeling and simulation represents  an enormous challenge to scientists, engineers, and  mathematicians.  An example of classical modeling is the Gunn  diode, which is acknowledged to be of critical importance in  microwave manufacturing applications; such devices appear in the  circuitry of the automobile, for example.  Its function depends  upon delicate oscillations of current and voltage, which must be  captured by computer  models if they are to be of any usefulness.  The principal investigator is open to any collaboration in the  manufacturing sector which might result from this work.  A possible  application of the quantum studies is the development (by others)  of logic gates in circuits that do not operate according to binary  \"off-on\" laws, but allow for multiple states of occupancy.  The  work described is highly collaborative and interdisciplinary,  including electrical engineers from the University of Illinois at  Urbana.  Computational mathematicians from Arizona State and Brown  Universities, and the University of Minnesota, and mathematical  analysts from the Courant Institute and from Stanford University,  are involved.  The results of past work have been regularly  presented at workshops on computational electronics, and published  in journals of electrical engineering and computational physics.  This practice is continued.",
