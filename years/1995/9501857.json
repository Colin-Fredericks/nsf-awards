 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501857  Otto   A guiding fundamental theory and implementation methodology is proposed for leading a manufacturing enterprise in developing a virtual prototype of existing production systems.  A design team can then engineer a new concept and virtually simulate its manufacture using design modeling tools that are factory-calibrated for the actual production facility.  As a central part of the research, a new methodology will be created for applying statistical tools to provide confidence measures in the predictive capability of the system.  This work will integrate factory-floor manufacturing process metrics into the product development process.  The work will address three phases of a design and manufacturing enterprise:  manufacturing operation modeling, product modeling, and product-process integration.  The development of a new undergraduate engineering course is proposed in which students will learn to reverse engineer mechanical products by creating physical models of them and then using these models to optimize their configurations.  This will teach design teams to optimize real products.  Conventional modeling and optimization methodologies will be included in the course, but the course will be structured into a coherent reverse engineering methodology, and will include a design project to further develop students' understanding of product concepts, uncertainty, discovery of unforeseen physics, and real human interaction in design.   Creating production system design models using these manufacturing process data collection systems will permit quantitative evaluation of ease-of-manufacturing, assist in tolerance allocation, and help predict manufacturing difficulties early in the design phase.  This work aims to produce results that can significantly increase the productivity and competitiveness of firms that use it for their design and manufacturing processes.",
