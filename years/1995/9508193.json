WinklerPrins University of Wisconsin  - Madison  Dissertation Improvement Research: Resource Use, Economic Change and Local Soil Knowledge Among Small-Scale Producers of Ilha Ituqui, Para, Brazil  The objective of this dissertation  improvement research is to understand the impact of a changing regional economy on local soil  knowledge.  The placement of  local systems of ecological knowledge within a broader sociological and  political economic framework is critical to their utility as guides to future sustainable resource  use.  The Ilha Ituqui floodplain island in the lower Amazon will serve as a setting to test  hypotheses.  The study will use an integration of human and physical geography methodologies.  Three  topics within the people-environment tradition of geography will be addressed by this research: local  soil knowledge studies, gendered knowledge, and soil quality maintenance.  The study approach  emphasizes the importance of evaluating local-level decision-making within a framework of broader  sociological and political economic arenas.  The study w ill demonstrate a link between economic  change and local ecological knowledge.  This link is a crucial connection for understanding  sustainable resource use because how small-scale producers of the area maintain soil quality in a  challenging flooded environment and under pressure of economic change will provide important insights  for other parts of the lowland tropics undergoing economic change.",
