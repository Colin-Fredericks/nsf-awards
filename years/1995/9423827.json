 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to continue the development of  a network of high performance workstations coupled through an  Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch for effective utilization  in computational structural biology.  The funds requested will  complement (matching) funds to be obtained from Hewlett-Packard  Comp. to build a cluster of sixteen (8 to be funded through NSF)  Hewlett-Packard workstations based on PA-RISC 7200 processors, to  acquire a communication backbone for this cluster (based either  on an ATM or on fibre channel technology, which will be decided  at the time of purchase), and to upgrade the ATM switch of an  existing cluster of 16 workstations.    The two clusters will be used: (1) for ongoing collaborative  projects with experimental laboratories which involve very large  scale modeling of supramolecular systems (membranes, phopspho  lipase A2 - membrane complexes, polymerization of G-actin to  F-actin and association of gene V protein with single stranded  DNA, complexes of nuclear receptor proteins with DNA, light  harvesting systems, and others); (2) for NMR protein  structure/function studies; (3) for studies of electron transfer  paths in redox proteins and for the prediction of protein  structures (protein folding).  One of the clusters will allow  users to pool small numbers of workstations (1-4), the other will  allow a pooling of 8-16 workstations.  The peak power of a 16  workstation cluster will also be utilized for real time modeling.    For effective parallel computing across the clusters molecular  dynamics programs (namd, vmd) have been developed and are being  further improved.  The effort is funded through an NIH Resource  grant and through an NSF Grand Challenge Applications Group  grant. Real time modeling will be based on a new graphics program  (vmd) for large screen stereo projections and 3D interactive  devices.    Besides the three principle investigators, sixteen experimental  investigators will benefit from the computational resources   sought in this proposal.  Two computer science faculty members  collaborate with us on molecular dynamics algorithms and parallel  computing software.  The computational work is partially funded  through a grant from the Carver Charitable Trust which has  provided six graduate students and two postdoctoral positions for  projects between the computational group operating the clusters  and experimental laboratories.",
