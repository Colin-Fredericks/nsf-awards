 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State University of New York College at Fredonia prepares to  host the \"Pathways of Mathematics and Science Summer Program.\"  The  need for the project in the target area (northern Chautauqua and  Cattaraugus Counties, Western New York State) is strong due to the  large number of minority students.  The target ares, considered  part of Appalachia by the federal government, is a region of hard-  working people, rich in multiethnic culture and heritage, but a  region whose population is primarily educationally and economically  deprived.  The project will serve 50 students annually from three  target schools.  This four-week commuter project will provide  unique learning experiences in mathematics and science to encourage  the students to continue the study of math and science, to realize  the importance of these subjects in their everyday lives and  appreciate that both are interesting and enjoyable.  The summer  project has three modules:  I) Knowing the course-work; II) Knowing  yourself; and III) Knowing the school system.  The content for  mathematics will be geometry, measurement, statistics, probability,  ratio, proportion, and algebra.  The content for science will be  ecology, environmental geology and mineralogy.  Instructional  activities are hands-on, independent study, intensive lab use, work  stations, and field trips.  Problem-solving, communication,  reasoning, and connection will provide students with the conditions  for learning mathematics and science.  An evaluation plan with  measurable outcomes will allow the project to make necessary  changes.  Community and institutional support are strong.  ***",
