 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  research  involves empirical  and theoretical  inquiry  into  techniques  for combining simple oscillators to produce  new  and  more   complex  robot  behaviors  from  existing  simpler   ones.  Previously  funded  work  in  the  PI's  laboratory  has  already  demonstrated that simple oscillators can be used to confer upon a  robot  superlative  but narrow dynamical dexterity.  The  present  study  attempts to demonstrate that effective coupling techniques  for such existing behavioral mechanisms can confer a much broader  range  of  behavior. The  empirical project addresses a   robotic  manipulation scenario termed ``Sensor Driven Dynamical  Pick  and  Place.''  In  this  scenario, the robot uses  a  flat  paddle  to  acquire  balls thrown into the workspace; balance or bat them  as  required  through  a  clutter;  loft them  into  an  out-of-reach  destination  receptacle;  and  resistunanticipated  perturbations  along  the  way. The recourse to oscillators reflects  an  almost  exclusive theoretical focus on event driven manipulation.    Such  a   commitment  to  feedback  control  addresses  the  fact  that  failures  in   machine reliability frequently  occur  because  of  events  which   are  not  intrinsically unrecoverable  but  which  violate  our  models dramatically and cannot be anticipated.  The  focus  on  error  detection and recovery in a  dynamical  setting  brings  into correspondence the concerns of the decade  old  (and  still vigorously developing) fine motion planning literature  and  certain concepts and analytical tools from  the century old  (and  still  vigorously developing) dynamical systems  literature  that  have proven useful in the PI's previously funded work.",
