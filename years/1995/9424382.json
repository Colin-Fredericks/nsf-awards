 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hirsch       The investigator studies several areas of dynamical systems  and its applications:  (1) Certain stochastic processes such as  generalized Polya Urns are now known to have sample paths whose  limit sets are almost surely Chain Recurrent sets for an  associated differential equation.  This allows the use of dynamical  systems theory in a variety of fields.  Applications are made to  Stochastic Approximations, Game Theory, Mathematical Economics of  sustainable resources, Numerical Algorithms, and Neural Learning  Algorithms.  (2) New methods for proving existence of Horseshoe  Chaos are applied to generalized Henon maps.  The Smale-Birkhoff  existence theorem is extended to replace the assumption of  transverse intersections between stable and unstable manifolds by  a much more general topological condition of nonzero intersection  number.  (3) New models of neural computation are constructed,  based on varying competition between oscillatory or chaotic  attractors, with competition controlled by an adaptive clocking  system.       Mathematical dynamical systems theory studies the long-term  behavior of complex systems.  This project develops rigorous  mathematics that can aid in the analysis of systems in several  applications.  (1) In Economic Theory, markets are often modeled as  a game played repeatedly between competitors who continually adapt  their strategies (e.g., prices, production) in the light of  experience.  It is of great importance to determine whether this  leads to a stable, predictable situation.  This project studies how  questions of this kind can be solved by translating them into  mathematical problems in the seemingly different but well  understood field of dynamical systems theory.  This application  builds directly on work by the recent Nobel Laureates in  Economics, Nash and Harsanyi.  The investigator is also  collaborating with economists on applications of the same  mathematical results to models of sustainable resources.  (2) In  many areas of science en gineering it is important to whether  particular systems are \"chaotic,\" i.e. inherently unpredictable in  the long run.  This project provides new means for determining  chaotic dynamics.  (3) The newly emerging field of Neural  Computation involves dynamics in many ways.  Some of the same  mathematical ideas used in the other parts of this project are  directly relevant.  In collaboration with biophysicists, the  investigator applies dynamical systems theory to new neural  network systems that can efficiently \"learn\" to do a variety of  useful tasks, such as robot control.",
