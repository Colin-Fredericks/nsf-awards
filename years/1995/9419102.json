 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor John H. Frederick at the Chemistry Department of the University   of Nevada, Reno is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program at NSF to study vibrational spectroscopy   and excited state molecular dynamics. The work supported under this grant   is focussed on light induced reactions that form isomers, different   stable geometries, in several gas phase molecules. The molecules that are   being studied are representative of a class of molecules which have   conjugated pi-systems. The first step in the studies is to use a   combination of experimental data and ab initio theoretical data to   construct descriptions of the interaction energy surfaces. Then, the   dynamics of excitation from the ground to the first excited state and   de-excitation back to the ground state are studied using both   quasiclassical and quantum mechanical methods. These studies may lead to   methods to control the way in which the reactions proceed and the amounts   of different isomers which are formed.   The photochemistry of molecules with conjugated pi-systems is of central   importance for many natural processes, such as vision and photosynthesis,   and for organic conductors. Many molecules in this class have been   extensively studied by experimentalists and by theorists and much is   known about the properties of these systems. However, the dynamical   mechanisms by which photochemical transformations occur are still not   fully understood. The work under this grant is addressing this missing   link.",
