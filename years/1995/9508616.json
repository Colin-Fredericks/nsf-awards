 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508616  Leger    The Department of Mineral Sciences at the American Museum of  Natural History (AMNH) and Department of Geological Sciences  (LDEO) of Columbia University will establish a joint electron  microprobe laboratory. This development builds upon numerous pre-  existing links between these departments such as a joint program  of Graduate Studies, research collaboration, and shared use of  experimental petrology, x-ray, and FTIR laboratories.  AMNH will  acquire of a new electron microprobe to replace the 18-year old  ARL SEMQ in current operation and to provide LDEO researchers  with added capabilities in the analysis of light elements and in  image analysis processing not currently possible with their 10-  year old Cameca MBX.  This grant supports half of the $800,000  capital cost of a new Cameca electron microprobe and half will be  supported equally by AMNH and Columbia University.  In addition,  AMNH supports a full-time Ph.D.-level research position (the PI)  to manage the facility.  Replacing the two aging microprobes with  a single state-of-the-art instrument has advantages for  efficiency of operation, full utilization of the analytical  facility, cost efficiency of internal operation, and maximizing  the use of scarce instrumentation dollars.  The new instrument  will lead to increased productivity and analytical capability for  multiple investigators at both institutions and in the New York  metropolitan area including students from the City University of  New York (CUNY) system.  A single laboratory has the additional  advantage that it will bring scientists from AMNH and LDEO closer  together and encourage new intellectual links.    ***",
