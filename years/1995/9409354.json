In addition, it includes theoretical work analyzing regime  switches in a fully dynamic model and how theoretical learning  models should be integrated into empirical research.        More specifically, this project applies and extends dynamic  econometric theories of consumption and investment to include  multiple durable consumption goods, habits, heterogeneity across  household \"technologies,\" a parametric version of risk-  sensitivity, and economies with long but finitely lived  overlapping generations of people.  The project studies  aggregation across households with habits and tastes for multiple  durable goods both in economies with complete and incomplete  markets.  A recurring theme is how permanent income types of  theory continue to surface in a variety of settings, and how they  can be used econometrically.  A link between permanent income  theories and econometric \"dynamic index\" models will be exploited  for estimation and forecasting.  In an overlapping generations  application of the models, the project estimates some of the  costs and benefits that would be associated with a transition  from an unfunded to a fully funded social security system.  The  project also examines a class of monetary models that promise to  broaden the range of evidence than can be brought to bear on  distinguished the quantity theory of money from one of its main  competitors, the \"real bills\" theory.",
