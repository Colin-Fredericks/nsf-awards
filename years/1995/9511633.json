In particular,  it will explore the separate effects of attention, of prior  knowledge, and of the task being performed on the nature of  visual memories.  Recent research is revealing surprising  evidence of the plasticity of the visual system:  Information is  often registered without awareness or conscious memory, although  it can be probed using indirect methods like priming or  interference with subsequent perception of the same objects.  The  conceptualization behind this research distinguishes between the  reactivation of prestored representations of familiar objects  (which leads to object identification or classification) and the  creation of new tokens, either of familiar or of unfamiliar  objects, representing the current stimulus as we are seeing it,  in its particular, perhaps arbitrary instantiation.    Several different priming paradigms will be used to study newly  formed object tokens.  One series of experiments will explore the  object-specific integration of information in displays of moving  objects.  The general question is how we maintain the coherence  and continuity of perceived objects as they move and change in a  dynamic environment.  Another explores the initial  representations that are automatically generated without  attention the first time a new object is seen.  A negative  priming paradigm, in which an unattended object becomes the  attended one on a later trial, will be used to explore the nature  and duration of these object tokens.  For example, is their  three-dimensional structure available?  Is their shape abstracted  from other aspects like size, color and orientation?  Under what  conditions can they be consciously retrieved, as well as  passively shaping our perceptual responses?  The focus will be on  the ways in which these implicit memory tokens differ from the  representations formed either for attended novel object s or for  unattended familiar objects.  The aim is to better understand  what roles attention and prior knowledge play and how they  interact in object perception.    This research may well lead to a better understanding of the  higher levels of processing in the visual system.  It may have  implications for ways of improving visual learning in a variety  of skilled tasks, and for better understanding the various  influences that unattended visual stimuli can have in shaping our  behavior (for example in advertising).  It may also suggest ways  of linking the inferred processes to neural mechanisms in the  brain, perhaps throwing light on the various difficulties  experienced by neurological patients with damage to specific  areas of the brain.    ***",
