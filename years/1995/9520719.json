 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520719    Modern  mammals differ from reptiles in having  an  upright,  rather than a sprawling stance.  This research will test the  hypothesis that therapsid dinosaurs, which were ancestral to  mammals,  were capable of switching between a sprawling  and  an  upright stance.  The biomechanically plausible range  of  fossil  therapsid  limb  postures will  be  calculated  from  measured  limb bone dimensions, estimated body weights,  and  model values of limb bone safety factors.  The safety factor  of  a bone is the ratio between its strength and the maximum  stress  to which it is normally exposed. In mammals,  safety  factors  of  limb bones range from two to four.  Weights  of  fossil  therapsids  will be estimated from  measurements  of  extant  reptiles and non-upright mammals.  Three-dimensional  analyses  of  locomotor forces and limb motion  in  reptiles  will  integrate  high  speed video,  recordings  from  force  platforms  during foot contact, and recordings of limb  bone  strains.  If safety factors of reptile bones match those  of  mammals,  limb  postures for therapsids that  yield  similar  safety  factors  are biologically feasible.   Postures  that  yield  safety  factors  outside the  acceptable  range  were  probably  not part of therapsid biology.  The research  will  contribute to knowledge of locomotor biomechanics in  living  reptiles  and  locomotor evolution in reptiles and  mammals.  The  biomechanical approach can be extended to other extinct  tetrapods,  and will place objective mechanical  constraints  on the reconstruction of fossil animals.",
