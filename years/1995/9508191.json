This presents the potential for improved  decision support, but poses challenges in terms of building tools  to support users in accessing, filtering, evaluating and fusing  information from heterogeneous information sources to support  user tasks.  Current explorations of Intelligent Agent technology  have considered a single agent for each task that acts as a  user's assistant.  This project explores coordination among  different agents that will collectively interact with other  agents on a user's behalf to find, fuse and utilize information  in problem solving in support of user task.  A key component of  the proposed research will be collaboration with Dr. Lemaitre of  the LANIA Research Institute in Mexico.  Because of its bi-  national nature, the research effort is expected to have  additional benefits, such as promotion of international  scientific collaboration, and additional opportunities for  experimental testing of our theories and research results.",
