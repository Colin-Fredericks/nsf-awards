 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for a Keystone Symposium,  Frontiers of Plant Morphogenesis, to be held at Hilton Head  Island, South Carolina, from March 29 through April 4, 1995.  The meeting will be held concurrently with another Keystone  Symposium, Signal Transduction in Plants, and there will be  two joint plenary sessions that will bring together both  groups of scientists for discussion of topics of mutual  interest.  The area of plant development is tremendously  diverse; however with the acquisition of modern cellular and  molecular information, common themes are beginning to  emerge.  It is therefore essential, at this time, that  workers in traditionally diverse areas be apprised of recent  advances in order for new syntheses to be developed.  To  date, there has not been a meeting that has concentrated on  bringing cell and molecular biologists together for the sole  intent of presenting and discussing problems in  morphogenesis.  This is the first meeting that will bring  together workers who are interested in understanding how  gene expression affects, and is affected by, second  messengers; how this information is translated by the  cytoskeleton into positional information; and how the wall  components, in turn, cue this positional data to define the  morphology of plant cells which ultimately defines the  overall shape of the plant.",
