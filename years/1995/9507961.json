 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9507961  Lutz, Peter L.      The brain of most vertebrates, including humans, has such an  obligatory high energy demand that even a short term interruption  in brain oxygen supply can result in irreversible neuronal damage.   However, in some unique species the brain can survive and recover  from the absence of oxygen for many hours.  Interestingly, the  mechanisms allowing this survival are recapitulated in the initial  phases of the mammalian brain responses to the absence of oxygen.   Clearly, chemicals in the brain functioning as messenger molecules  are of paramount importance in regulating brain activity.  Dr. Lutz  proposes to investigate the role of these messengers in tolerating  oxygen deprivation.  One messenger seems to play a paramount role  in the response to oxygen deprivation, and that messenger is  adenosine.  Therefore, Dr. Lutz will determine the role of  adenosine in conserving brain energy stores during oxygen  deprivation and also in protecting the brain from the ravages of  cell loss during periods of low oxygen levels.  By learning the  mechanisms by which the system survives oxygen deprivation,  valuable insights will be provided into the processes underlying  the harmful changes that occur during oxygen deprivation in  mammalian species and humans.",
