In animals, cell  death affects morphogenesis, and removes a variety of cells,  including those that have completed their function, cells  that have developed improperly or  those that exist in  excess.  In plants, programmed cell death occurs as a  consequence of normal senescence, local lesion formation,  and as the terminal developmental event in the formation of  certain specialized tissues, such as the xylem.  The  ultimate fate of the cells programmed to die in animals is  engulfment and degradation.   Degradation during programmed  cell death in plants appears to be mediated not by  engulfment, but rather by intracellular hydroytic enzymes  including nucleases, carbohydrases and proteases.  While  little is known concerning the exact role of proteolysis in  cell death, regulation of the ubiquitin-dependent pathway of  proteolysis appears to be important during programmed cell  death in animals and plants.  Using biochemical approaches,  the role of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in programmed  cell death will be investigated by characterizing changes in  activity of the ubiquitin pathway and identifying substrates  of this pathway unique to the autolyic phase of tracheary  element differentiation in Zinnia elegans mesophyll cell  culture system.   The results of these studies are  applicable to all higher plants and potentially to animals  because of the high degree of conservation of the ubiquitin  pathway and of mechanisms of programmed cell death among  species.  A more complete understanding of cell death in  plants may lead to genetic engineering strategies for  manipulating senescence and cell death for the purposes of  increasing productivity, nutritional value, and disease  resistance of food crops and may also enhance our  understanding of situations where cell death goes wrong in  mammalian systems, such as during abnormal tumor growth and  neurodegenerative  diseases.  %%%  Naturally occurring cell death is an active process that  serves a number of important functions.
