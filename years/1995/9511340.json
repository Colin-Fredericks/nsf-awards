 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the real-time processing of sentences  with focus constructions within the framework of a representational  theory of the semantics of focus. We will concentrate primarily on  sentences and discourses exhibiting contrastive focus, with special  emphasis on the theoretical notion of a contrast set, the group of  alternative entities, properties, etc., that something in the  assertion in the sentence implicitly stands in contrast to.       Existing literature clearly establishes that readers and  listeners devote extra attention to focused words and phrases.  However, to our knowledge, there has been little psycholinguistic  work to date conducted within the context of an explicit  representational theory of focus. Consequently, fundamental  questions about the informational contribution of contrastive  focus, and its consequences for on-line language processing, have  not yet been explored. The research that we are planning  investigates the processing of sentences and discourses  exhibiting contrastive focus, as understood within the context of  current semantic theory. The most basic question is whether  contrast sets are indeed computed during the course of  understanding an utterance marked with focus against the  background of a discourse context, and, if so, when are they  computed, and how are they computed (that is, what factors govern  their determination). We will also examine how they are used in  managing attention (and salience of entities) in discourse  processing and interpreting referential expressions.       Most of these questions will be examined using a new  experimental paradigm in which subjects follow spoken  instructions to manipulate objects in a workspace while their  eye-movements are monitored using a video-based camera system.  Preliminary work using the visual world paradigm has demonstrated  that listeners seek to establish reference incrementally, making  eye-movements to relevant objects that are closely time-locked to  referential expre ssion in the instructions. Subjects typically  make an eye-movement to an object prior to reaching for it and  the programming of the eye-movement to the target object occurs,  on average, within several hundred milliseconds of the word in  the instruction that makes that object unique with respect to the  relevant visual alternatives.",
