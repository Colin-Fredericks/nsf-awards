 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific objectives of this proposal are to:    1) Determine the functional domains of the subunits of wheat germ  eIF-(iso)4F and eIF-4F.    The subunits of eIF-(iso)4F have been expressed in E. coli and  recombined to form an enzymatically active complex. Mutations will be  made in the subunits of eIF-(iso)4F and eIF-4F and tested in an in  vitro wheat germ translation system and several in vitro assays that  measure partial reactions, i.e., ATP hydrolysis, RNA unwinding,  cross-linking to the m7G cap and binding of mRNA to 40S ribosomal  subunits.    2) Complete the partial cDNA sequence of wheat eIF-4B and express this  protein in E. coli.    The missing portion ( 100-200 nucleotides) of the cDNA for eIF-4B will  be obtained by RACE-PCR, inverse PCR or genomic sequencing. The cDNA  will be expressed in E. coli and the enzymatic activity determined in  the assays described above (Specific Objective 1).    3) Complete the cDNA sequence for the subunits of Arabidopsis eIF-4F,  p28 of eIF-(iso)4F and eIF-4B and express these proteins in E. coli.    We will continue to screen using antibodies to wheat factors and wheat  cDNA sequences. Different regions of the wheat cDNAs will be used to  prepare probes for screening. The cDNAs for the Arabidopsis factors  will be expressed in E. coli. The activity of the expressed Arabidopsis  factors will be measured in the assays described above. The completion  of this goal will set the stage for future work in vivo exploring the  control of expression of the initiation factors and regulation of  protein synthesis in plants.",
