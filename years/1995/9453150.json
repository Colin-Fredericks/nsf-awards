 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453150  Wright    The Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement project is  the result of a collaboration between five Alabama school  districts and the University of Alabama, Huntsville (UAH).  The  project will combine resources from the school districts, UAH and  local engineers and scientists to support a hands-on, module-  based science curriculum.  The curriculum to be implemented will  include NSF funded STC, FOSS, and Insights materials as  instructional modules.  The five school districts will also  support a Materials Resource Center that will supply and  refurbish materials for teachers and provide professional  development for teachers and principals.    During this five-year project, 518 teachers will receive 100  hours of professional development and 102 selected lead teachers  will receive substantial enhancement of 230-400 hours. This  extensive training will build local capability for continued  improvement after the project expires.    The summer program focuses on the enhancement of the lead  teachers.  They will analyze  progress made during the past year,  plan follow-up activities and prepared new workshops for teachers  and principals in the upcoming school year.  They will provide  leadership to the teachers in their schools for implementing  change.  Three of these lead teachers will be chosen to become  full time project staff so they can conduct workshops, visit  schools to assist in on-site enhancement, and guide district and  multi-district teacher enhancement sessions.  Lead teacher-  principal teams will inform parents about the program.    Cost sharing is 117% of the total NSF requested budget.    ***",
