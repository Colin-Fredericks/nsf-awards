 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brook    In collaboration with Dr. Lawrence Robbins, Dr. George Brook will  conduct archaeological and paleoenvironmental research in the  Kalahari Desert of Botswana. They will focus their work at the  site of Tsidilo Hills, a rocky outcrop which has been inhabited  intermittently for tens of millennia. In recent work, the  investigators have discovered 13 prehistoric mines which are cut  into these hills. Preliminary evidence indicates that these may  be at least 1,000 years in age and that a number of minerals such  as mica schist and coloring agents were obtained. In this  multidisciplinary project the team will map and photograph all of  the mines. They will excavate a series of one meter squares into  the charcoal rich mine floors to recover dating samples and  artifacts and they will also dig in mine tailings. Test  excavations will be conducted in a large painted cave that is  located next to one of the mines. A second phase of the project  involves a program of paleoenvironmental study which will permit  reconstruction of climate and climate change during the period  that the mines were in operation. With this data it will be  possible to study human-environmental interaction and examine the  extent to which mining activities were influenced by climatic  change. In situ sediment samples will be collected in the region  and sediment texture and chemistry will be determined. Bucket  auguring will be conducted to recover sediment samples in  adjacent valleys and thin sections collected from stalagmites to  measure annual layers. My this means it should be possible to  obtain a 2,000 year record of layer thickness, a proxy of  rainfall. This data will provide the longest high-resolution  proxy record of rainfall for southern Africa and should allow the  reconstruction of temporal variation in climate during the period  under study.    This research is interesting for several reasons. For the last  2,000 years both hunters and gatherers and agriculturalist-  pastoralist have inhabited the Ka lahari. Anthropologists have  been very interested in the long term relationships between these  groups and wish to know whether the Bushman peoples - claimed by  many researchers to be \"pure hunter gatherers\" - did in fact  function this way. The study of mining will provide a basis for  looking at interaction and trade. In particular it should be  possible to determine which group in fact was associated with the  mining activities. The environmental research will provide an  excellent basis for examining human behavior in a natural  context. Many anthropologists have postulated that changes in the  extent and intensity of trade networks served to buffer  environmental change and unpredictability.",
