 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal, we will address the physics of local and global  conversion of magnetic free energy to particle kinetic energy  during substorms.  An understanding of these processes will be  important implications to the global response of the magnetosphere  to solar wind variations.  For example, this could lead to an  understanding of the partitioning of substorm released free energy  between energy lost down the tail and work done on the inner  magnetosphere and ionosphere.  Also, such a theory of the global  release of stored magnetic energy during substorms could have  important implications for energy release phenomena in other space  physics and astrophysical contexts.  The difference between the  presently proposed study and similar studies of the past is that  our study will be based upon the current sheet catastrophe model  for local current disruption  c.f. Lui et al., 1988 .  This model  arises from time independent and time dependent calculations of 1D  current sheet configurations with a nonzero Ey and nonzero Bz   Burkhart et al., 1992a; Pritchett and Coroniti, 1993; Burkhart et  al., 1993 .  It was found in these calculations that under the  quasi-static evolution of the boundary conditions a force  imbalance, which we have called the current sheet catastrophe,  develops.  Subsequent time development leads to the turbulent  destruction of the current sheet over some time interval and the  conversion of the associated magnetic field energy to particle  energy.  In the proposed research, we shall perform ID calculations for a  variety of initial conditions and boundary conditions to determine  the robustness and scaling of the signatures of the current sheet  catastrophe.  We shall study the radial expansion of current  disruption in a 2D, time-dependent, hybrid code, using, for the  first cut, x-independent initial equilibria.  We shall extend the  1D equilibrium calculations to include x-dependence and we shall  study the expansion of activity and the corresponding local  and  global conversion of magnetic field energy to plasma energy using  the x-dependent initial equilibria in a time-dependent, hybrid  simulation code.",
