 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert E. Wyatt at the Department of Chemistry, University of   Texas at Austin, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for theoretical studies of the   spectra, dynamics, and reactions of small polyatomic molecules. The work   supported under this grant is specifically concerned with spectroscopy   and with time-dependent vibrational dynamics; it is divided into three   main topics. First, there is the study of the high energy vibrational   spectra and dynamics of three representative molecules. Second, new   mathematical and computational methods are being developed for the   efficient treatment of the challenging computations which occur in the   first topic. In the third topic, research is being carried out on new   theoretical methods which are required in order to be able to study very   large molecular systems. The common theme which links the various parts   of the work being carried out under this grant is to obtain information   about and understanding of the time, spatial, and energetic aspects of   the evolution of vibrationally excited states.  The dynamical properties and the spectra of molecules are consequences of   the way in which the electrons and the nuclei which compose the molecule   interact with each other. A goal of the supported research is to learn   how information about these fundamental interactions can be extracted   from a knowledge of the molecular dynamics and spectra.",
