 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the development of geometric    methods and  their numerical applications.  The project involves  the   design of efficient  algorithms for a variety of fundamental  problems in parallel   geometric and  numerical computing and the  implementation of these   algorithms on both modern  supercomputers  and workstation clusters. The research has   two principal  directions.    Geometric Methods for Unstructured Mesh   Partitioning and  Generation: The main theoretical and software question is how   to  make use of  underlying geometric structures and numerical  conditions to   generate an unstructured finite element  mesh and partition   it for subsequent  parallel numerical  simulations.    Parallel Numerical and   Applications: The primary goal  is to apply geometric mesh   techniques to the  parallel solution of large sparse linear   systems, to adaptive  and  hierarchical computations, to distributed COSMOS circuit    simulation, and  to dynamic load balancing for parallel N-body  simulations.      The companion  education plan is to design and teach courses in  computer   science, in the newly  introduced Scientific Computation  Program at the University   of Minnesota, and  in the areas that  bridge the two.  It involves the   development of research  programs  and projects for graduate and undergraduate   students who are  interested in interdisciplinary research.  It also involves   the  development of  summer professional programs for professionals  from industry   companies,  government research labs, and other  universities, to   initiate the collaboration  between universities  and industry.",
