 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508628  Berner    Organisms  generate heat by the breakdown  of  fuels  during  cellular metabolism.  In endotherms, metabolic heat  can  be  produced fast enough to raise body temperature significantly  above  that  of the surroundings.  In ectotherms,  rates  of  metabolic  heat production are so low that body  temperature  is determined primarily by the surrounding environment.  The  aim  of  this  research is to determine the mechanisms  that  permit endotherms to produce heat at a greater rate than can  ectotherms.   High  rates of metabolic heat  production  are  usually  linked  to  high  rates of oxygen  consumption  and  production of usable chemical potential energy.  These  last  two   processes   occur  in  subcellular   organelles,   the  mitochondria.   This  research will  contrast  the  rate  of  oxygen  consumption  and  chemical  potential  energy  (ATP)  production  by the mitochondria of endotherms and ectotherms  under a variety of conditions.  Experimental treatments will  include  varying  the temperature at which the  mitochondria  work  and varying the fuels provided to the mitochondria  as  they  perform their metabolic functions.  The research  will  improve  understanding  of  the mechanisms  responsible  for  metabolic differences between endotherms and ectotherms  and  of how these differences evolved.",
