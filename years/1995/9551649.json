 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the Computer Technology Department is  establishing a Novell network system, which is currently the  industry standard.   The newtwork resembles a real-world local area  network, consisting of 18 IBM PCs and 3 Power MAC workstations, as  well as several printers.   The laboratory supports four core  courses in a new 1-year certificate program:  Introduction to  Networks, Network Administration, Advanced Network Administration,  and Fundamentals of Internet Work.   The college also offers a  62-credit associate degree program in Computer Networks.   Eligible  students include:  currently employed computer operators requiring  training for career advancement, high school graduates, and clients  under the Job Training Partnership Act.   Information about the  project and its outcomes will be widely shared through the American  Association of Community Colleges, the New England Board of Higher  Education, Internet, and a summer Tech Prep institute for high  school teachers.",
