 "awd_abstract_narration": "9552497  Tornatzky    A key premise of this proposal is that telecommunication and allied  information technologies have the potential to significantly  improve the performance and enhance the restructuring of K-12  schools, as well as to impact national and regional issues of  educational equity.  However, we also feel that the potential of  these technologies is blunted or frustrated at the school level by  ineffective implementation, particularly related to issues of  planning, strategy, training, technical support, logistics,  acceptance, and administrative or community support.  Simply  stated, teachers and school leaders lack proven and practical  strategies, tactic, and practices to affect the process of  technological and organizational change.    At the same time, implementation in schools is enacted in a multi-  level policy context.  That is, teachers and administrators charged  with the responsibility of technology implementation are confronted  with a confusing array of district, state, and federal policies and  programs, all presumably designed to enhance the transition to a  technology-enriched classroom.  These include various  administrative directives, funding programs, goals and standards,  demonstration programs are designed and launched with no empirical  evidence on their impacts on actual technology implementation at  the building level.    To rectify this problem, we propose a policy research project which  will systematically gather data from teachers, principals, school  districts, and state administrators on their practical experiences  and advice in implementing educational technologies and the  facilitating and /or inhibiting role that policy has played  therein.    Results of the project will be packaged in a form that will be  readily usable by practitioners and policy makers alike.  A  regional dissemination effort, consisting of report distribution  and briefings, and the launching of a regional telecommunications  network of exemplary implementation practioners  are proposed.  ***",
