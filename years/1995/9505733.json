As the Board is  newly created, it needs to develop a strategic plan and a new  program of studies of interest to potential sponsors.  This  proposal provides for partial support to support and maintain Board  activities, promote interchange between the Board the potential  sponsors, and develop a program interchange between the Board and  potential sponsors, and develop a program of studies that will both  serve the needs of sponsors and permit the development of a robust  support structure.",
