 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418833  Hayes  This project deals with the general question of the interpretation  of paleoceanographic information that is encoded in the organic  debris of sea floor muds and sediment cores, that is, what is the  relationship between the sedimentary carbon and nitrogen isotopes  of organic molecules and contemporary oceanographic conditions.    Specifically the linkages among types of algae, conditions of their  growth, and the concentration of organic and inorganic nutrients  will be examined through the analysis of seawater and sediment  samples obtained from the Bellinghausen and Amundsen Seas in early  1994.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the relationship  between the Carbon-13 content of specific species of algae, and the  concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, and dissolved carbon dioxide  in the water column.  The seas surrounding Antarctica are important  in this context because of their presumptive importance in  regulating global climate patterns.    On the global scale, measurements of  sedimentary Carbon-13 are  made routinely in the context of biogeochemical cycling studies.   However the association of  Carbon-13 isotopic variability with  particular processes or phenomena that appear statistically valid  in one region are generally found not to be valid in others,  implying that small-scale relationships cannot simply be  generalized to large-scale relationships.  The advantage of  analyzing this particular data set lies in the fact that a large  body of ancillary information was obtained on the cruise, and  therefore the strong potential exists to tie together existing, but  less complete, data sets in addition to elucidating temperature  effects on underlying biochemical processes, and defining  specifically antarctic processes.  ***",
