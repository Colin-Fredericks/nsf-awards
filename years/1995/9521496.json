 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gerard  9521496  The genetic adaptations that enable certain plant species to  survive and grow in polar environments where temperatures are  near or below 0oC year-round are poorly understood.  Low-  temperature adaptation is complicated in terrestrial plants by  freezing, desiccation and stomatal conductance, and in marine  phytoplankton by a variable and unpredictable physical  environment.  Polar macroalgae provide an experimental system  that is not subject to these complications and that is well-  suited to the study of cold-adaptation in plants.  Cold-  adaptation is particularly well developed in Antarctic  macroalgae, in which rates of photosynthesis and growth at OoC  are comparable to rates achieved at 10-15oC by temperate species.   The proposed research uses endemic Arctic and Antarctic seaweeds  to answer the question, \"What adaptations do polar algae possess  that enable them to assimilate carbon and grow rapidly at very  low temperatures?\"    The research focusses on carbon-metabolism characteristics of  three closely related polar-temperate pairs of brown algae:  Arctic Laminaria solidungula and temperate Laminaria  saccharina;  Antarctic Desmarestia anceps and temperate Desmarestia aculeata,  and Antarctic Himantothallus grandifolius that is related to  Desmarestia aculeata and D. anceps, but is morphologically  similar to Laminaria saccharina.  Carbon-metabolism processes  (photosynthesis, respiration and light-independent carbon  fixation) that are important in cold-adaptation will be  identified in sporophytes of each species pair acclimated to the  same temperature.  Specific mechanisms of adaptation will be  determined by comparing components of the photosynthetic  apparatus as well as contents, activities and thermal properties  of key enzymes involved in photosynthesis, respiration and light-  independent carbon fixation.  Comparisons of multiple species  pairs and a broad suite of carbon-assimilation parameters will  provide a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms of  low-  temperature adaptation in algal species endemic to both the  Arctic and Antarctic Oceans and increase an overall understanding  of low temperature adaptation in all plants.",
