 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university is developing an Adaptive Technology Laboratory  for its mentally and physically challenged students.   The number  of students with disabilities who are studying or want to study  at this institution is increasing.   The creation of an Adaptive  Technology Laboratory provides students with disabilities who  major in science, mathematics, and computer science the tools  with which to perform their work.   It enriches their learning  experience and substantially improves the support given to these  students in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  of 1973.   More importantly, this project enables them to develop  the necessary independence that leads to increased productivity,  self-esteem and, ultimately, access to careers in science,  mathematics, and computer science.   Students who use this  technology are being asked to evaluate the impact on their  coursework, homework, and study habits.   Results of these  surveys are being shared through two newsletters:  Special  Education Resource Center Newsletter and ConnSense Newsletter as  well as at conferences and on-line.",
