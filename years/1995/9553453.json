 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9553453  Ward  The Globalization and  Democratization training program is  a new interdisciplinary graduate  training and research effort which  focuses on how transformations of  the global economy affect the  practices and prospects of  democracy in different societies.  This program builds upon our  individual and collective teaching  and research interests, and the  strengths of the Research Program  in Political and Economic Change in  the Institute of Behavioral Science  at the University of Colorado. It  will forge a strong program of  training and research aimed at  producing a top-flight cohort of  interdisciplinary social science  scholars who will be trained in  behavioral science approaches that  emphasize both globalization and  democracy. These scholars will have  training in individual disciplines  as well as training that transcends  contemporary departmental  structures; they will be integrated  into ongoing interdisciplinary  research projects on a variety of  level of social organization,  ranging from the workplace to the  international system; some will  work actively on developing new and  innovative curricular spin-offs on  the topics of globalization and  democracy at the graduate and  undergraduate levels; and some will  also be involved in international  exchanges.  A separate research proposal on the  manner in which democratic norms  and practices have spread since  1815 is appended to this training  grant proposal.",
