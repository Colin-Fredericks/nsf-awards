 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vision of Texas CREATE is to dramatically change the  perception of advanced technology careers in Texas by establishing  a Center of Excellence at Austin Community College.  From this  Center, CREATE will coordinate a strategy to affect its vision.   CREATE will achieve four goals:  core curriculum development in  three areas, implementation of the core curriculum in both  secondary schools and community colleges, establishing the  sophisticated infrastructure which supports curriculum development  and implementation, and finally evaluating its activities both  formatively and summatively.       At the heart of CREATE's curriculum development is a new  foundation course, Introduction to Advanced Technology, built  around a carefully selected set of instruments as a medium for  hands-on experiential learning.  This course simultaneously exposes  students to a wide range of technological activities and skills and  develops their abilities in math and science in an integrated,  holistic fashion.  CREATE believes all technicians should be  trained in the fundamentals of environmental science and provides  a mechanism for doing so in its course, Fundamentals of  Environmental Science Technology.  CREATE's third course,  Fundamentals of Electronics Technology, is a radically new and  exciting way of teaching students introductory electronics by using  Mobile Robot technology developed at Texas A&M University.       The implementation of CREATE's curricula at the high school  level is achieved by a three-year program of summer camps which  reach 135 secondary schools and bring both teachers and students  together as learning partners.  CREATE also plans an intensive year  of exposure to advanced technology for community college  administrators, faculty and students.       CREATE will support its curriculum by validating skills, by  student recruitment with emphasis on women and minorities, and by  establishing sophisticated electronics links and a central  clearinghouse for articulation agree ments among institutions of all  kinds.  CREATE will work cooperatively with organizations like the  American Chemical Society and the American Society of Mechanical  Engineers to enhance the professional status of technicians.       Noteworthy among CREATE's dissemination activities will be use  of a World-Wide Web Home Page, state-wide teleconferencing,  materials production on CD-ROM, and development of packaged  educational materials commercially distributed.  CREATE's  evaluation efforts will be both formative and summative and will  benefit from advice from outstanding external evaluators like those  at Texas A&M University's Public Policy Research Institute.",
