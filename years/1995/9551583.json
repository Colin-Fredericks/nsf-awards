 "awd_abstract_narration": "The knowledge of biology is increasing so rapidly that the  breadth of biology can no longer be taught in a single course.    The Biology Department has addressed this issue by abandoning the  traditional introductory survey course and adopting a group of  fundamental courses.   In cell and molecular biology, the  fundamental courses are Molecular Biology, Developmental Cell  Biology, and Biochemistry.   This opportunity is being taken to  develop innovative labs in cell and molecular biology that  demonstrate the principles discussed in lecture and that also  allow students to perform the state-of-the-art techniques.    Through this project, equipment is obtained that enables faculty  to teach students state-of-the-art techniques in these  fundamental cell and molecular biology courses.   New  experimental modules stress investigative approaches.   Labs  include forensic DNA typing, using the polymerase chain reaction  technology (Molecular Biology), Western blotting to identify  specific proteins expressed during neural development  (Developmental Cell Biology), and DNA footprinting to study the  interactions of the lac repressor with the lac operon operator.    The strength and uniqueness of this proposal come from the  innovative design of the new curriculum.   A large number of  frosh and sophomore students use sophisticated equipment to learn  state-of-the-art techniques previously not available or only  available in upper-level courses.   Early exposure to these  techniques, in experiments carefully designed to pique students'  interest, better prepares them for upper-level classes and  increases their interest in both research opportunities and  graduate school.",
