 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to investigate the possibility of radar detection of atmospheric  changes resulting from red sprites.  Sprites are flashes of light extending upward from cloud tops  into the ionosphere.  They occur in association with large thunderstorm systems.  Current  theories suggest that sprites are produced by large electric fields in the upper atmosphere that  accelerate charged particles.  These particles produce ionization that may be detectable by  ground-based radar systems.  The investigators will deploy a portable radar in Colorado so that  the measurements can be made in coordination with optical observations as part of a campaign  to be conducted in the summer of 1995.  They also intend to make measurements of midlatitude  spread F echoes, a recently discovered phenomenon that only occurs during periods of low solar  activity.  These echoes were previously detected by a much larger radar in Japan, but it is  possible that they may also be detectable the portable radar to be used in this experiment.  If  successful, these experiments will lead to the development of new diagnostic techniques for these  two atmospheric phenomena.***",
