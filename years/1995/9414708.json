 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pham   This project is a conference on the subject of the performability of industrial computing systems that require hardware, software, and human operators to run.  Such systems include advanced manufacturing, high-speed transportation systems, communication systems, and medical equipment to name only a few.  The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers in industry and academia to share ideas and research results on the state-of-the-practice on hardware/software/ human performability on industrial computing systems.  It is also the objective of the conference to discuss and identify future research directions in this subject area.  Identification of critical research issues and the obstacles to be overcome in advancing the state of research in the area will also be covered.  It is hoped that such a conference will spur collaborative effort between researchers in academia and industry.  A tangible output of the conference will be a bound proceeding containing the papers presented and discussed at the meeting.   The problem of effective and reliable operation of hardware/software/human systems are ever present.  Failure of such systems or inabililty to control and manage them always carry with them high negative consequences in terms of cost and safety.  For these reasons, it is extremely essential that control and planning methodologies to better understand and operate such systems are developed.  This is a critical research area whose prominence and importance will continue to grow in the future.  Better understanding of such systems will be of significant benefits to the economy.",
