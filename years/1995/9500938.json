 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500938  Tong    Professor Tong will study problems that derive from the deeper  study of intersection theory and moduli spaces. He hopes to study  more algebraically the flat projective connections on certain  vector bundles over Teichmuller space. He also wishes to study  the connections between the BRST differential studied in  mathematical physics and the Cech-Koszul complex.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, yet it  directly connects to two of the great advances in theoretical  physics in this century--quantum mechanics and general  relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts  of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary  flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated  figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest  equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of  methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology,  and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as  in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.  ***",
