 "awd_abstract_narration": "U. Cal Los Angeles  This CAREER award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of   the research and teaching activities of  Dr. David C. Myles. The research   will focus on the design, synthesis, and characterization of self   assembled mono- and bilayers that serve as membrane mimics that will be   used to study fundamental parameters of interfacial recognition, orient   complex structures in the membrane, and carry out catalytic   transformations. Receptors such as bis-aminopyridines  will be tethered   to the surface of the monolayer membrane to study the effects of the   environment on the surface and the binding and detection of ligands such   as alkylbarbiturates.  The information gained through this research will   be used to self assemble membranes that model cell membranes by   incorporating helical peptides.  These systems will be used to model   complex membrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin.  The teaching plan   will address issues specific to communicating chemistry to the large   classes encountered at UCLA without losing sight of the individual. The   focus will be on individualized education, organic chemistry curriculum   development, mentoring , and outreach programs in elementary and junior   high schools.  The goal of this research is to gain insight into membrane bound   phenomena through study of well defined chemical events in the context of   structurally proscribed systems. Such studies are surface and interfacial   analogues of molecular recognition in solution and are relevant to   recognition phenomena in cell membranes. This research will also provide   high quality research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate   students.",
