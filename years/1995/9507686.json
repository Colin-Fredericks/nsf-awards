 "awd_abstract_narration": "Of the several gravitational wave sources that could  potentially be seen by LIGO and VIRGO, the most promising  candidate appears to be mergers of neutron stars or black  holes in tight binaries.  For the so-called `Advanced'  versions of these detectors, anticipated event rates from  mergers are ~102/yr.  Naturally, one will want to glean as  much astronomical information as possible from these  detections:  one will want to determine the angular position  and distance to the binary, whether the bodies are neutron  stars or black holes, the masses of the two bodies,  et cetera.  Prof. Cutler will initiate a program of research  to determine how accurately LIGO/VIRGO can measure these  quantities.  In extracting this information from the  gravitational wave signal, there are two kinds of errors:  measurement errors due to detector noise, and theoretical  errors due to limitations on the ability of relativists to  accurately calculate the inspiral waveform for a given set  of binary parameters.  Cutler is investigating both kinds of  error, using a mixture of Monte Carlo and analytic  techniques.  The analysis is made difficult by the fact that  much of the interesting information is encoded in small,  post-Newtonian pieces of the waveform.    There are three principal motivations for the above  research.  First, it provides guidance to experimentalists  as to which elements of the detector design are most crucial  for doing astronomy.  Second, it provides theorists a guide  to the level of accuracy they must `shoot for' in solving  the two-body problem.  Third, the results allow one to judge  the feasibility of potential astronomical applications of  binary coalescences, such as using them as standard candles  to determine the Hubble constant.",
