 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's goal is to   develop an exposition of a new algorithm for the Traveling Salesman problem.  This problem is theoretically intractable, and practical  heuristic  techniques for large TSP problems have been elusive.  In April 1992,  a team of researchers established  a new world record by solving ten previously  unsolved problems, with sizes ranging from 1,060 to 3,038  cities, from a  standard library of test data called TSPLib.  (In particular, the 3,038-city  problem is  the largest TSPLib instance ever solved.)  The program, developed by  four people in the course of four  years, has some 50 thousand lines, not  counting the code that implements the simplex method.  The  algorithm consists  of new ideas on every level of its design, from novel approaches to finding  cutting  planes all the way down to the minute details of data structures, not  to mention the strategies of  parallelizing the computations.",
