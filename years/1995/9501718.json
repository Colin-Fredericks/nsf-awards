The analysis procedure involves the finite element implementation  of the equations governing the dynamic behavior of a three-phase  system consisting of pore fluid, pore gas and soil skeleton. The  governing equations are derived by extending Biot's formulation  for the dynamic behavior of a fluid-saturated porous media to a  three-phase system, with an independent verification using  mixture theory. In developing these governing equations, special  attention is focused on defining the appropriate set of  constitutive equations.    This analysis procedure will improve the understanding of the  behavior and design for static and earthquake loading of  structures such as landfill clay covers and bottom liners and  compacted soil embankments. The developed analysis procedure will  also help to prevent the huge financial losses caused each year  by the damage to houses, buildings, roads and pipelines resulting  from the shrinking and swelling of soils. Furthermore, the  analysis procedure as well as the centrifuge tests will provide a  better understanding of the flow of water through unsaturated  soils, an important problem in studying the migration of  pollutants through soils.    EDUCATION PLAN    The education plan is a comprehensive approach to familiarizing  undergraduate and graduate students with the emerging  cross-disciplinary field of geo-environmental engineering and  current research and industry practices in geotechnical and  geo-environmental engineering.    An objective is to introduce more multi-disciplinary real world  design problems into the undergraduate courses, such as  introducing multi-media modules in the teaching of basic  principles so as to  allow the students to explore a certain  topic at their own pace. Another objective is to  acquire a small  teaching centrifuge for undergraduate students and to introduce  them to this important research tool in geotechnical and  geo-environmental engineering.    Graduate students are encouraged to acquire a broad knowledge  base by combining both experimental and analytical aspects in  their research, as well as working on projects with other faculty  outside their thesis or dissertation topics.  Development of a  graduate level course called \"Environmental Geotechnology\", which  can also be taken as a professional elective by undergraduate  students, emphasizes the importance of geotechnical issues in  solving environmental problems.  ***",
