A computer based interactive program allows students to  simulate their own homework problems and thereby be led through  an effective routine for problem solving. Emphasis is on  abstract concepts such as fields and potentials where the  student has no basis of practical experience. The simulations  are to be integrated into an existing Precision Teaching  routine which is successful in improving student performance  (and halving student attrition). Emphasis throughout is on  quantitative assessment of outcomes and elimination of  co-lateral variables.  Development of the simulation is  under-way. Support is sought for completion of the development,  for integration into the Precision Teaching routine and for the  assessment of performance change. The assessment program  includes comparisons between test and control groups,  implementation in courses covering 2,000 students per year and  transfer to another institution. Faculty response will be  monitored through surveys, student response assessed also  through surveys and student performance measured through the  standard techniques of tests and quizzes.  The program will  monitor performance of almost 6,000 students and track some of  these through the full three years. Correlations will be sought  with gender, minority status, performance before entering the  class and with performance through the major courses.",
