 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Project focuses on producing novel plastic optical fiber (POF) core materials. The fiber core polymers must be transparent in the visible region and in the near IR region of the electromagnetic spectra. The proposed concept is to use styrene monomers which have bromine and chlorine atoms attached to the polymer side group. These halogens increase the refractive index of the polymers and increase near IR transparency. Optical, thermal and mechanical properties of the materials will be evaluated. This proposal describes novel, but highly feasible ways to design optimum fiber core materials. It is a very timely proposal because new light sources have altered fiber core transparency requirements. In the past most plastic fiber optic devices were coupled to low cost LEDs that operate on the 650 nm range. PMMA plastic was optimum for these devices because it is transparent at 650 nm. The recent development of fast LEDs and inexpensive lasers shifted the transparency needs for POFs. Plastics that are transparent in the near IR region are now of great interest. PMMA has CH stretch overtones in the near infrared that limit its use with the new light sources. A recent market study predicts that the market for plastic optical fiber (POF) will increase from the current annual level of $50 million worldwide to $264 million by 2001.  POFs are used in scientific instruments, nuclear radiation detectors, displays, signals, industrial control, data transmission, consumer electronics, and medical and automotive lighting applications. Japan is the leader in optical fiber production - 90% of the 300,000 km of plastic optical fiber being used today was manufactured by Japan. Japan has clearly been more aggressive in commercializing high end uses of POF than the U. S. This Phase I research will allow OPRI to penetrate this market.",
