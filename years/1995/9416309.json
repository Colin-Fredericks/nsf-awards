 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416309    Panero    This Americas Program award will  fund a  research  collaboration between Dr. Jose Panero, Michigan State  University Herbarium and Drs. Patricia Davila and  Jose L.  Villasenor,  Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,  for a  botanical exploration of the Mixteca Alta region of Oaxaca  and Puebla, leading to an  inventory of all vascular plants  of the region.   This project is part of an ongoing  collaboration  between the Michigan State University  Herbarium and the National Herbarium of Mexico to publish  the Flora of Oaxaca and adjacent regions.   The Oaxaca area  has been divided into ten study  regions to concentrate  attention on one particular sub-flora at a time.  The  present research will serve as a  pilot project for the  entire Flora of Oaxaca project.  It will  include  enumeration of the flora, and implementation of a database  system to generate a specimen database that will produce an  accurate account of the floristic diversity and distribution  in the State of Oaxaca.  As the project matures, several  other components of the relational database system will be  developed.  The composition and distribution of the major  vegetation assemblages in the region will  also be examined  at this time as part of a project to prepare a chorological  atlas for the  state of Oaxaca.    The southern Mexican state of Oaxaca harbors the richest  flora in that country.  In spite of the high species  diversity and high level of endemism, the flora of the state  has never been systematically inventoried, nor all of its  areas collected.  Adequately documenting and describing this  flora is important in understanding the evolution of a major  portion of North America flora.  Because the area is under  increasing human pressure, there is a need to document its  floristic composition before further disappearance of the  native flora. Therefore, the initial collecting efforts of  this project will be directed at gathering as many specimens  as possible in an area where the flo ra is most threatened by  extinction.  ***",
