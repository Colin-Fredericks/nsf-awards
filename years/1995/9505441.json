Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a genetically controlled cellular process wherein a cell will commit suicide or will be murdered by another cell in response to  specific physiological signals.  Interest in this field has exploded in the last two years in large part because gene products controlling apoptosis have been identified.  Investigators can now begin to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms involved in the cell death process.  The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers working on diverse aspects of apoptosis, and to create a meeting environment suitable for the exchange of information and ideas which will foster advancement in the field.  %%%  This meeting will provide exchange of information and new insights with regard to the field of programmed cell death by bringing together a group of scientists with diverse backgrounds and approaches for the study of cell death.  It is anticipated that the frontiers of science will be significantly advanced by support of this project.  ***",
