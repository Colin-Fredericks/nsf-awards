 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports the research and professional  development of Professor Clara Chan. Chan will investigate the  polytope algebra and its connections to the algebra of piecewise  polynomial functions and cohomology of toric varieties. She will  also continue her work on cubical polytopes. The main focus of  the educational plan is to bring more advanced technology into  undergraduate mathematics courses at Virginia Tech, especially in  the area of Discrete Mathematics.    The research component of this project is in the general area of  Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods  to study how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The  behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern  communications. For example, the design of large networks, such  as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of  algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of  objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.",
