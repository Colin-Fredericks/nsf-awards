 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501119  Brock    The  objective  of  this  research  program  is  to  measure  the  transient structural response of a charge-density-wave  (CDW)  to  sudden  changes  in  either the driving  electric  field  or  the  temperature.   These   data  will  be   used   to   test   modern  nonequilibrium  statistical  mechanical  theories  developed   to  describe  the  growth  of  materials in the  presence  of  random  impurities  and defects. A common theme running through  many  of  these  models  is the derivation of an equation of motion  for  a  hydrodynamic  variable  such as mass density,  concentration,  or  temperature.  The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation is an  example  of  such   an   equation  of  motion  which  has  recently   received  considerable   attention  in  the  literature.    Formally,   the  equations  of  motion  for the various correlation  functions  of  interest  follow  directly from the equation of  motion  for  the  hydrodynamic variable. In spite of the well-defined nature of the  question, there are very few direct experimental tests of any  of  these  models.   However, x-ray scattering  measurements  of  the  transient  structural response of the CDW's are nearly ideal  for  such  tests. To first order, one can consider CDWs to  be  nearly  sinusoidal  quasi-one-dimensional density waves  and  x-rays  are  diffracted  by  the  periodic structure.  Detailed  equations  of  motion describing the local phase of this density wave have  been  proposed.  This project will test these models by applying a time-  dependent  driving electric field, or temperature to  the  sample  and  then measuring the transient structural response of the  CDW  using  synchrotron  based, time-resolved,  high-resolution  x-ray  scattering. Comparison will be made with previous measurements of  transients  in  the  electronic transport by  performing  in-situ  current-voltage measurements.  %%%  In  recent  years, mathematical models describing the  growth  of  materials   have  received  cons iderable  attention  because   of  technological  interests  in growing novel  materials.  From  the  theoretical, point of view, this interest is due, in large  part,  to  predictions  that materials growth should  exhibit  phenomena  similar to those exhibited by systems at phase transitions (e.g.,  at   the   critical   temperature  where   a   material   becomes  superconducting). Consequently, the successful theoretical  tools  developed  in  the  1970's to study phase transitions  are  being  brought  to  bear  on  this new problem. In spite  of  the  large  theoretical effort, there are very few direct experimental  tests  of  any  of  these models. X-ray scattering measurements  of  the  evolution of a charge-density-wave (CDW) system are nearly  ideal  for  experimental  tests for some of these growth  models.   CDWs  occur  at  low  temperatures in certain  metals.  Although  their  origin  is  quantum mechanical, in the simplest approximation,  a  CDW  can be thought of as a small but repetitive variation in the  average  density of atoms. In many cases, when an electric  field  is  applied to the sample, the CDW responds by \"sliding\"  rigidly  through  the  crystal.  This project will test  these  models  by  applying  an  electric field (or change in  temperature)  to  the  sample and then use x-rays to measure the structural evolution of  the CDW.  ***",
