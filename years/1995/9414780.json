 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414780  Garg         As man-made systems such as automated factories,  communication networks, and computers continue to grow in size,  \"cut and try\" approaches to design and supervision become less  realistic.  What is needed instead are controller synthesis  techniques that allow optimal control laws to be derived  mathematically and with performance properties that can be  verified automatically.  A well-established framework exists for  control of systems without explicit real-time constraints.   However, if timing is of concern in the system dynamics and its  performance specification then the situation becomes much more  complex.         Certain real-time discrete event systems can be described by  linear equations in a non-traditional algebraic system called  max-algebra.  For these systems, the problem of supervisory  control is to impose delays on the execution of selected events  to achieve some specified performance goal.  The objective of the  proposed research is to examine the existence and synthesis of  controllers for DES which include such time constraints.  Our  method relies on the max-algebra model for timed DES which  permits control theory results for untimed DES to be related to  timed systems.  ***",
