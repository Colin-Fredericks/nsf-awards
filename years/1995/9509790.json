The application of variable temperature scanning tunneling microscope (VT-STM) and inherent atom-resolved capabilities of STM with different operation and temperature ranges will provide access to real-time dynamics on the growth surface.  Basic mechanisms of silicon-hydrogen surface chemistry and its role in promoting low temperature growth as well as the activities of hydrogen atoms in controlling surface diffusion and related processes at reduced temperatures to enhance epitaxy will be studied. %%% The primary goal of this research project is to establish greater basic understanding of particular phenomena critical to thin film synthesis and processing of electronic materials, and to relate this understanding to the development of advanced microelectronics devices through modifications in processing methods. Additionally, an important feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. The knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute generally to improving the performance of advanced devices used in computing, information processing, and telecommunications. ***",
