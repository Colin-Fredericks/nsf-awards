 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422895    The Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP) undertakes major independent studies of national issues in U.S. science policy and U.S. technology policy.  In recent years, for example, it has conducted prominent studies on U.S. policy goals for science and technology, policies related to global warming, integrity in the conduct of scientific research, U.S. policy for civilian technology, and recruitment and retention of Presidential appointees.    COSEPUP's core activities, including meetings of the Committee itself and a staff of two, are underwritten substantially by internal funds (individual studies are separately funded).  NSF has supported COSEPUP for 30 years.  Beginning in 1979 the NSF contributed to COSEPUP's core funds in a sequence of two five-year contracts (each allocating funds in five annual increments), and one two-year transition contract.",
