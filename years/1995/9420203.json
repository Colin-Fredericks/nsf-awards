 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420203  Mayo  13C- and 15N-dipolar auto-and cross-correlation spectral densities  and NOEs will be determined to systematically investigate backbone  and side-chain rotational dynamics in short linear peptides.  13C-  multiplet relaxation in methylene and methyl groups will provide  unique motional information.  Side-chain motions then will be  better understood in the absence of most steric hinderences, e.g.,  the \"unfolded,\" solvent-exposed state.  Penta-peptides like G-G-X-  G-G will be studied to assist in separating relaxation effects due  to correlated internal rotations and overall molecular tumbling.   The temperature dependence of all relaxation parameters will be  investigated in order to derive rational energy barriers.   Measurements will be done in water and in organic solvent, e.g.,  DMSO.  In water, the effect of pH and varying ionic strength will  assist in understanding electrostatic contributions to internal  rotations.  Restricted and unrestricted rotational diffusion,  rotational fluctuation within potential wells, jump models,  inclusion of internal rotational correlations, etc., and \"model  free\" approaches will be used to analyze relaxation data, and  molecular dynamics simulations and F,Y,C bond rotation energy  profiles will be  calculated for insight into which bond rotations  may contribute most to these relaxation phenomena.    %%%  Proteins are composed of backbone atoms arranged in a repetitious  polymeric array and specific side-chain groups that are arranged in  a specific sequence.  This sequence-specific arrangement of the  twenty common side-chains tells, for example, a protein how to fold  and what function it will have.  In this study, NMR spectroscopy  and computer modeling will be used to investigate fundamental  processes of how small parts of proteins  move and behave in  solution.  This in turn will provide a better understanding of  protein backbone and side-chain internal motions and the influence  of their motions on each other.  In addition, due to  the very  nature of correlated motions in proteins, this study will set the  stage for a better understanding of protein folding, the so-called  \"second genetic code.\"   ***",
