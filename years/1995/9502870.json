 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502870  Gilbert    This dissertation enhancement award supports a 3-month  research visit in Japan for Philip Williams, a graduate  student at Mississippi State University, who works under the  direction of Professor Jerome A. Gilbert.  Mr. Williams'  three month stay in Japan will be hosted by the Professor  Kazuhiko Ishihara at the Tokyo Medical and Dental  University.  The collaborators seek to improve the lubricity  of weight-bearing prostheses via the fabrication of lipid-  attracting polyurethane materials.  The specific aim of the  research stay by Mr. Williams is the fabrication and  characterization of an elastomeric material whose surface  represents an interpenetrating polymer network with material  capable of attracting boundary lubricants.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of biomaterials/bioengineering. The  U. S. graduate student will have the opportunity to become  familiar with research techniques, data, equipment, and  facilities the Tokyo Medical and Dental University while  contributing to the overall research effort. The host laboratory  possesses the skills to fabricate polymers, developed for blood-  compatibility reasons, suitable for attracting boundary  lubricants.  The host will learn from Mr. Williams about  considerations associated with the alternate application of their  materials.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of  the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international collaboration.  ***",
