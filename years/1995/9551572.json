 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a result of the project, microcalorimetry is being integrated  into chemistry major laboratories.   Calorimetry is among the  most fundamental of physical measurements with extensive  applications to biological and materials chemistry.    Technological advances have so increased the sensitivity of  calorimetric measurements to the point where convenient studies  of the energy changes associated with living systems are possible  for such phenomena as membrane formation and phase  segregation/aggregation even with very small sample sizes.   The  initial experiments of the project allow students to grasp the  nature and importance of energy changes in biological systems by  determining enthalpies of micelle formation and the binding  constants of proteins and suitable ligands.   Moreover, we  students measure the heat capacity of the novel memory metal  alloy NiTi.   The improved instrumentation also enhances carbon  compounds and junior year laboratory programs through the  introduction of purity determination using differential scanning  calorimetry as well as the range of independent research projects  for senior students.",
