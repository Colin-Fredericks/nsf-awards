Silicon x-ray energy spectrometers have become a very important tool for elemental analysis in research and industry.  Currently, the deep sensitive depths required for silicon x-ray detectors and some other silicon detector applications usually are obtained by a compensation technique commonly referred to as Li Drifting.  Unfortunately, Li Drifting is only quasi-stable at room temperature and very unstable at higher temperatures.  The temperature stability problem limits the performance and general usefulness of these detectors by prohibiting modern device processing technologies like oxide surface passivation and high-temperature contact formation.  This research addresses the feasibility study of an alternative approach to compensation of silicon which would allow sensitive depths > 3 mm, be compatible with high-temperature oxide passivations, allow high-temperatures contact formation , and be cheaper than Li Drifting.  this new technology should result in cheaper x-ray detectors which will operate satisfactorily at the higher temperatures obtainable with thermoelectric or other alternative cooling techniques.  It also should make it possible to build very large area, deep sensitive depth detectors at reasonable prices.  A high-temperature compatible technology which can replace Li compensation will have  a large impact on the silicon x-ray energy spectroscopy market; particularly in the area of portable field instruments.  It also will unlock new market opportunities in silicon charged particle detector spectroscopy and perhaps in optical detectors.  ***",
