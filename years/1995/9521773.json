 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521773  MATHIS   Relative to other groups of \"higher\" insects, the order Diptera, the flies, have been little studied.  This is especially unfortunate because the order contains many vectors of human and animal diseases, important crop pests, and even beneficial parasitic insects that have been effectively utilized in biological control of other insect pests.  This PEET award will train badly needed new systematic specialists in three families of Diptera, the Rhagionidae, Tanyderidae, and Aulacigastridae.  Training will encompass a postdoctoral associate and undergraduate student involvement, as well as training two graduate students.  Monographic treatments ranging from a family revision to generic and specific level revisions are predicted.  The results of these researches will be databased and made available electronically  in addition to formal publication.   The results of this research award will contribute to our knowledge of elements of the biodiversity of an important order of insects.  The award will support the training of new practicing systematists proficient in modern methods of systematic analysis and capable of conducting further research on other groups.  Results of this particular research have potential applicability to human health issues and agriculture as well as to various areas of basic biological research involving these flies in all their life stages, such as ecology, ecosystems research, population biology, etc..",
