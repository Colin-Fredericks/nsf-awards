 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal:  DMS 9505461     PIs:  Robert Kass, Constantine Gatsonsi, James Hodges, Nozer   Singpurwalla     Institution:  Carnegie Mellon University     Title:  Bayesian Case Studies Workshop, October 1995           Abstract:          The symposium entitled ``Bayesian Statistics in Science and Technology:   Case  Studies III''   held at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh,   Pennsylvania,  includes  extended presentations of applications of Bayesian   methods.  These applications are in  problems  in which the statistician is an   integral member of the research team.   The objectives of the symposium are   to: (1)identify and focus attention on specific implementation and   theoretical problems that hinder applications of Bayesian methods, and to   identify candidate solutions; (ii) provide a forum in which the interplay   between statistical theory and practice will be explored in the context of   concrete research projects; (iii) provide a small-meeting atmosphere within   which junior investigators and graduate students can  explore substantial   Bayesian applications with experienced researchers;  and (iv) produce a    volume containing well-documented case studies and data sets suitable  for   use by researchers, practitioners, educators and students of applied statistics    and other quantitative fields.               Today there are  increasing amounts of  background information available   to  scientists undertaking an investigation.  It is important to utilize   previousknowledge effectively in designing studies and analyzing data.   Bayesian statistical methods are tailored to this purpose.  There have been   many recent advances in Bayesian statistical theory and computation, but   scientific meetings rarely spend  substantial time discussing  successful   applications of these methods to substantive scientific problems. This   symposium  concentrates attention solely on applications  of Bayesian   statistics.  The application areas range from economics to population    biology .  The result will be the elucidation of the interplay between theory   and  practice  and the identification of successful methods that will  point to  important directions for future research.  The interactions and dynamics of   the workshop will be captured and disseminated via video tape and in the   more traditional written  form of a conference proceedings.",
