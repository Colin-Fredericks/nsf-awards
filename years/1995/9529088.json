 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will elucidate geochemical and biogeochemical processes that are important  at the watershed scale in alpine basins.  It will examine these processes using a multidisciplinary  approach that combines stable and radiogenic isotopic tracers, plot level experiments, process-level  modeling, and field research to constrain the modeling results.  New isotopic tools will be used in  combination with field measurements of water quality and quantity to separate the relative  contributions of atmospheric and soil-derived sources of nitrate in streamwaters, increase our  understanding of the biogeochemical reactions controlling alkalinity, and provide insights into the  dynamics of sulfur deposition.  A key objective is the development of a robust model for solute  transport built on fundamental principles to predict the fate of a variety of chemical constituents at  many sites and under a variety of conditions.  The relevant geochemical, biogeochemical and hydrologic  processes are interconnected at the watershed scale and therefore must be studied together.  The  algorithms used for this ph ysically-based mathematical model provide an integrated approach to  modeling the hydrology and biogeochemistry of seasonally snow-covered alpine basins with model  development and field work inextricably linked.  This research will contribute to a better fundamental  understanding of the biogeochemical and geochemical processes, which can be used in responding to  anthropogenic perturbations. The multidisciplinary research team has cooperative support from the  National Biological Service, U.S. Geological Survey, the National Park Service, and the Long-Term  Ecological Research Program.  The two study areas are Niwot Ridge/Green Lakes Valley and Lock Vale  Watershed, which lie on the east slope of the Colorado Front Range.",
