 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502945  Kanellakopoulos  Since most physical systems contain nonlinearities and unknown  parameters, adaptive control of nonlinear systems is directly  relevant to practical applications.  The Principal Investigator's  previous research resulted in several new systematic design  procedures which deliver high performance over large operating  regions without an increase in control effort and without  requiring full-state measurements.      The proposed research plan will continue the development of a new  generation of adaptive systems, in which the nonadaptive part of  the controller is capable of guaranteeing boundedness, while  adaption is used only for the improvement of transient an  asymptotic performance.  Additional design tools will be  developed that not only result in even stronger stability and  performance properties, but are also applicable to larger classes  of nonlinear systems, and characterize those classes via  geometric conditions.  The new tools will be applied to problems  which are of importance to commercial applications such as  induction motors, the automated operation of heavy-duty vehicles  on intelligent highways and semiconductor manufacturing  processes, and will develop cooperative research efforts with  interested industrial sponsors.    The proposed education plan will develop several new  undergraduate and graduate courses on linear, nonlinear and  adaptive control, as well as an undergraduate laboratory control  course.  Furthermore, it will enhance the teaching effectiveness  of control systems through the early introduction on nonlinear  examples and concepts in order to stimulate student interest and  ensure their understanding of the fact that linear control theory  can only yield regional results for most physical systems.  In  addition, the education plan includes graphical and symbolic  software into the undergraduate and graduate control curriculum,  so that students can spend less time deriving complicated  expressions and coding them into a simulatio n package, and more  time exploring design options, comparing different approaches,  and watching the results of their efforts come alive through  animation and visual simulation.    ***",
