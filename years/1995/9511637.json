 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511637  Sejnowski    Recently a new field of engineering has emerged, referred to as neuromorphic engineering, that is based on the design and fabrication of artificial neural systems, such as vision chips, head-eye systems, and roving robots, whose architecture and design principles are based on those of biological nervous systems. A two-week workshop on neuromorphic engineering will be held to bring together young investigators and more established researchers from academia with their counterparts in industry and national laboratories, working on both neurobiological as well as engineering aspects of sensory systems and sensory-motor integration. Formal lectures will be given, but the primary focus will be hands-on experience with research tools for all participants. The workshop will serve as a bridge between the engineering world of artificial neural systems and the neuroscience community. The workshop will provide an environment for intensive interactions between members of these two communities - merging engineering principles with experimental results from neuroscience. The interaction of these two disciplines should have significant impact both on the development of new technologies (new artificial neural systems) and on our understanding of how the nervous system is designed.   ??",
