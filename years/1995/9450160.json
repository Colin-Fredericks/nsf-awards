It will do this by establishing a network of physics faculty in two-year colleges.  The network will consist of 15 regional organizations, coordinated and linked by a national steering committee.  The development of the network of colleagues will allow two-year college faculty to share their successes as teachers and scholars with each other and with the broader physics community, it will increase their awareness of current developments in physics education research and innovative teaching strategies, and it will decrease the sense of isolation felt by many two-year college faculty members.  During the four year project, fifteen Regional Coordinators and their Regional Teams, selected and mentored by a Steering Committee, will organize and host small local meetings and will lead participants as they develop project s and programs within their regions relating to critical and topical issues that may be particularly important in the region.  Many of these issues will be developed from the work begun at the 1989 topical conference entitled  Critical Issues in Two-Year College Physics and Astronomy - 1990 and Beyond  supported by the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) and at the 1992 NSF Workshop on the Role of Professional Societies in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education in Two-Year Colleges.  To enlarge the network and provide a national forum, the Regional Coordinators and three elected delegates from each region will participate in a national meeting, convened as an AAPT Topical Conference, where various speakers and consultants will engage participants in a more global discussion of critical issues and issues of particular and timely pedagogical significance.  These conferences will make recommendations for national reform.  By the conclusion of the project, the Steering Committee will have produced three proceedings from the annual meetings, will have compiled and published demographic data better describing the two-year college physics education communities, and will have written a major report characterizing the two-year college faculty and its impact on the physics education community of our country.  In addition, fifteen regional structures will have been established, under the auspices of AAPT, which will allow for the continued collaboration on issues of importance to the physics education communities.
