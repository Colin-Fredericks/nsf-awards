 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Theoretical   and Computational Chemistry Program at NSF, Daniel Neuhauser at the   Chemistry Department of the University of California at Los Angeles will   investigate problems in three distinct research areas in molecular   structure and molecular dynamics. The work in all three areas is based on   related mathematical approaches for the efficient diagonalization of   large matrices. The first area uses a Quantum Monte-Carlo approach to   obtain accurate electronic wavefunctions and potential energy surfaces   for molecular systems. The second area involves efficient solutions of   path-integral simulations of molecular dynamics and scattering, both   reactive and non-reactive. The third area involves the determination of   the normal modes for the vibrations of proteins.  Neuhauser's teaching   plans include an increased emphasis on undergraduate research and the   introduction of computational chemistry projects into undergraduate   coursework.   The work in each of these three areas of research will extend the   understanding of the fundamental processes which underlie many important   chemical reactions. The reactions to be studied initially in the first   two areas were chosen because of their relevance to combustion processes.   One of the goals of the studies of the normal modes in proteins, the   third research area, is to obtain information necessary for the   simulation of reactions involved in photosynthesis.",
