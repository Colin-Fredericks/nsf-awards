 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417649  Monson     Thermodynamic properties of a fluid adsorbed in a porous material are substantially modified by the confinement created by the geometry of the porous material.  This plays an important role in adsorption equilibrium for pure fluids and in selective adsorption from mixtures.  Theoretical studies of such phenomena have been mostly restricted to molecular models in which the porous material has a well defined and simply characterized geometry.  This proposal is concerned with what happens if the microstructure of the material is not so easily defined or characterized.  Such materials are the rule rather than the exception in practical applications ranging from adsorption separations to catalysis to the modeling of oil reservoirs.  The proposed work involves the further development of molecular models of disordered porous materials and studies of adsorption equilibrium using molecular simulation.  This will be accompanied by the development and application of cluster expansion, integral equation and mean field theories.  The nature of phase equilibrium in such systems will also be explored.  ***",
