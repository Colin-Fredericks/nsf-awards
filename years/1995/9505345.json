The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. David M. Perrin to work with Professor Claude  Helene of the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in  France.    Antisense technology encompasses virtually all research  directed toward the rational generation of molecules which  can associate with DNA and/or RNA to block protein  production, suppress cell growth and division, or even kill  the cell.  The goal of this project is to characterize  antisense interaction by exploring 1) the synthetic coupling  of medicinally important DNA-damaging functionalities to the  oligonucleotide, 2) the synthesis and properties of more  resilient nucleotides, 3) the synthetic coupling of  intercalators to increase the stability of the interaction  and to characterize the antisense association by  spectrophotometric techniques and 4)the generation of other  sequences whose inhibitory properties will be examined in-  vivo in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. ***",
