The thermodynamics of the  superconducting  transition  near  the  mean-field line,  and  the  range  of  validity   of   the  Lowest-Landau-Letel  approximation   to  multilayers  with  various anisotropy will be  investigated.  Experiments  on  the  melting of the two-dimensional  vortex  lattice  will  focus on different crossovers in  the  vortex  dynamics   as   the   length   scales   are   being   tuned.  Superconductor-insulator  transitions  will  be  studied  by  varying  systematically the degrees  of  screening  and  the  Coulomb  potential. The nature of the zero-field  superfluid  transition with increasing amount of disorder will  also  be  investigated. The difference between weak and strong pinning  will  be sorted out by studying the role of disorder on  the  resistive  transition and vortex dynamics.  The  variety  of  transport and magnetic measurements in the above experiments  will  provide  the global phase diagram of the  multilayers,  this  may  uncover  new  glass phases  and  their  incipient  correlation.  %%%  High temperature superconductors are layered materials where  superconductivity occurs in the copper-oxygen  planes.  They  exhibit  peculiar properties due to this two-dimensionality.  This  proposal  investigates  the  resistive  transition  in  magnetic fields, and the role of vortex structure and motion  causing    energy    dissipation   in    high    temperature  superconductors  and  two  dimensional  superconductors   in  general. A broad range of experiments will be conducted on a  model system of molybdenum-germanium/germanium multilayer in  which the PI's have extensive expertise and capabilities  of  co ntrol  and  characterization. These  experiments  together  will provide a better understanding of the phase diagram  as  well  as the kinetics associated with the various phases  of  two-dimensional and layered superconductors.  ***",
