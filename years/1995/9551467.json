 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the Helisys Rapid Prototyping (RP) machine is  used to teach the principles of concurrent engineering in an  Engineering Technology program.   Rapid prototyping is the  process of creating a three-dimensional object directly from a  computer- aided design (CAD) file.   This process is  revolutionizing the prototyping step in the design/engineering  process in much the same manner CAD revolutionized drafting and  computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) revolutionized manufacturing.   The RP equipment is being immediately incorporated into the  curriculum to teach the contemporary concept of concurrent  engineering.   This concept allows manufactured products to be  developed and produced much faster than previously possible  because several design and manufacturing activities can occur at  once.   One of the key pieces of equipment to teaching concurrent  engineering is the RP machine.   This machine gives students  hands-on experience with an emerging technology and prepares them  to enter a global market place.   They can actually convert their  CAD design to three-dimensional objects that will be analyzed for  form, fit, function, and assembly.   This new ability holds  students accountable for their designs.   The RP machine also  gives the PI and CoPI the opportunity to develop national  curriculum models for use by other institutions of higher  learning when the RP equipment becomes common place in both  industry and education.",
