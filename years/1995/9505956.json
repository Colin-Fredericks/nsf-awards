 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, targets the  development of direct amperometric affinity electrodes for application as immunosensors and  DNA probes.  These devices will expand the newly created class of biosensors based on \"wired\"  redox macromolecules.  In these amperometric sensors, substrates selectively undergo electron  transfer with redox proteins which in turn undergo electron exchange with amperometric  electrodes.  \"Wiring\" of redox processes is accomplished through immobilization of enzymes  at electrodes in an imidazole-substituted polyacrylamide hydrogel containing coordinated osmium  wherein substrate analytes are afforded easy access to enzyme sites, and electron exchange  between enzyme and electrode is mediated  by the redox polymer.  Increased analytical  sensitivity derives from the use of both high-turnover enzymes and highly efficient mediation  of electron exchange between enzyme and electrode.  Specific goals to be pursued by Professor  Heller and his students during the tenure of this three-year grant include bringing electrochemical  DNA sensing to a level of sensitivity that will obviate the need for polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) amplification of the probed sequence, and surpassing the speed of present PCR  methodology through enhanced mass transport in the hydrogel of the amperometric biosensor.    The development of more rapid, sensitive, and selective techniques for detecting and quantifying  biomolecules is broadly important to fundamental disciplinary and technological advances.   Through synergistic combination of fundamentals of biochemistry, biophysics, materials  chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and electrochemistry, new biosensors will be developed which  have selectivity and sensitivity characteristics that exceed current methodology.",
