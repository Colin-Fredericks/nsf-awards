 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on the problem of quality control in a batch manufacturing system. Its aim is to develop techniques for identifying policies and control measures to apply to quality control problems. The techniques are described as dynamic in the sense that they are not limited to parametric designs but also consider the finding of policies and controls. The focus is on sequential techniques. Sequential techniques  make use of the dynamic information that result from testing and process monitoring.  Process control  will be studied with other related logistics issues in batch manufacturing. In particular, the  research will proceed along the following directions: (1) inter-stage coordination under capacity  constraint, (2) coordination among production, inspection, and process revision, (3) coordination  among subassembly operations and substitutable components, and (4) computation, approximation, and  aggregation techniques. The research also aims at identifying certain optimal sequential procedures  and revealing their structural properties, particularly, optimal sequential policie s with threshold  structures. The basic methodology underlying the research emphasis is Markovian decision programming  incorporated with the use of stochastic comparison techniques, including those based on the notion of  stochastic convexity and stochastic submodularity.   This research will yield several benefits if  successful. It will advance the state of knowledge in quality control in batch manufacturing. In  particular, the effectiveness of the sequential contrml policies, the importance of quality dynamics,  and the coordination of process control with other production logistics represent key contributions.  In addition, there will be new industrial technology findings based on the research. Finally, there  are some educational gains as well. The research will present new teaching materials for an  engineering course in dynamic process control. This way, next generation engineers will benefit from  the research by taking the knowledge gained from the course to their various employing organizations.",
