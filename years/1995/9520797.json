 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520797  Womack    It has been hypothesized that short-period comets and giant comets  (like Chiron and SW1) share a common origin in the Kuiper Disk located  10-100 Astronomical Units (AU) from the Sun.  Interestingly, recent  observations indicate that these two populations of Kuiper disk comets  may exhibit very different physical and chemical behavior. For example,  short-period comets are small in size ranging from 1-10 km in diameter,  and are predominantly water ice and so sublimate mostly within 1-2 AU  from the Sun; while the giant comets are > 10 times larger than  short-period comets, sublimate at larger distances from the Sun (r > 5  AU) and hence are thought to be comprised of some other highly volatile  ice (quch as methane, carbon monoxide or Nitrogen).  Current models of  the protosolar nebula indicate that the chemical behavior of the  dominant carbon-bearing molecules carbon monoxide, formaldehyde,  methanol, and hydrogen cyanide are very sensitive to the physical and  chemical processes that occurred during solar system formation.   Therefore, the relative abundances of these species in primitive icy  bodies, such as comets, are expected to place powerful constraints on  comet-formation models.  Comparison of these molecular abundances in  the two populations of comets are, therefore, vital in testing models  of the Kuiper disk region of the solar nebula.  Observations of the  rotational spectra of emissions from carbon monoxide, formaldehyde,  methanol and hydrogen cyanide will be obtained of comets using  millimeter and submillimeter wavelength telescopes.  Complementary  observations will be obtained and optical imaging techniques will be  used in interpreting the spectra.  A fundamental goal of this research  is to make an exploratory comparison of carbon chemistry in several  short-period comets with that in two large, distant comets.  This work  will search for chemical differences between these two groups to  examine whether or not they are really two distinct divisions , or  instead are better described by a continuous distribution of different  chemical compositions.  The work will help establish the feasibility of  the proposed observations, determine which molecules are the best for  testing models, and determine how often the large continuously active  comets need to be observed in order to significantly constrain models  of solar system formation.",
