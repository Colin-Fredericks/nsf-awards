 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528731  Papadimitrakopoulos         Recent manufacturing breakthroughs in lightweight, low-power  light sources made at E-Lite Technologies, Inc., using polymer  encapsulated ZnS:Cu/Mn phosphor materials, gave substantially  improved their flexibility and allowed a cost-efficient coil-form  production.  Based on similar phosphor (ZnS), employing a more  rigorous all-inorganic ZnS-based approach, multi-color  electroluminescent (EL) flat panel displays are being  manufactured at Westinghouse-Norden Systems.       This proposal seeks to develop an environmentally conscious,  solvent-free processing of large area ZnS:Cu/ electroluminescent  illuminators.  The present technology employs 85 weight % solvent  (a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and N-methyl pyrrolidone) to  disperse the active EL ingredients and the polymeric binders.   Subsequent evaporation of the solvents poses environmental  difficulties.  The proposed process would be based on 100%  photopolymerizable monomers along with electrostatic phosphor  deposition.  This would allow the manufacture of high quality EL  films without the requirements of any solvent.  In addition, we  propose to enhance light out-coupling efficiency (with 50-100%  increase in brightness) as a result of \"medium-transparent\" EL  particles.  This novel process would involve matching the  refractive indices of the EL ZnS:Cu/Mn particles with that of the  binder polymer matrix.  The refractive index of the polymer  matrix would be substantially increased by incorporation of nano-  sized high refractive index, non-emitting inorganic  nanoparticles, such as GaP and A1GaP.  The entire procedure can  be applied by a supercritical CO2 process, followed by ultra-  violet curing.       The proposed process would not only increase the brightness  and lifetime of EL lamps, but it would also allow pixelation to  realize flat-panel displays.  This will enhance the  competitiveness of thin-film EL against upcoming competing  technologies, such as organic EL.  In addition, the  novel,  environmentally friendly and cost effective processing techniques  and high efficiency structures would provide the technological  edge to compete in the large display market that is forecasted to  grow over two hundred billion dollars during the next five years.   The background of principal investigators at UConn, E-Lite  Technologies Inc.  and Westinghouse Norden Systems, as well as  the availability of complementary research laboratories and  production facilities makes the proposed research a natural  collaborative endeavor.  ***",
