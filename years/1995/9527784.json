The objective of this project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a unique interdisciplinary curriculum in Biomedical Optics.  The thrust of the new curriculum includes the development of four new senior undergraduate and introductory graduate courses based on research advances made within the Biomedical Engineering Program at Texas A&M University in collaboration with internal and external medical centers.  This new curriculum  will integrate optically based therapeutic, diagnostic, and monitoring principles into the bioengineering curriculum as well as provide unique courses which by their nature are each multidisiciplinary and cover fundamental principles highly relevant to other traditional engineering disciplines.  ***  ??",
