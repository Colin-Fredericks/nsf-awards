 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508662  Drew    The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Based   Graduate Research Assistantships provide the opportunity for graduate students to spend   part of their time in the classroom and part of their time in an industrial setting. These   awards are a means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the   nation.   This research will model the flow of a fluid containing a large number of small   paramagnetic particles. When this fluid is subjected to a magnetic field, the particles tend   to align (polymerize), and the flow properties of the fluid change dramatically. The aligned   states will be modeled using a probability density function for the length of chains of   particles. A Monte Carlo model for the distribution function will be derived, and   appropriate attachment and breaking models tested. This model will be coupled to the   fluid flow. The result of this work will be a prediction tool that incorporates the   microscopic physics of the processes involved in the lengths of the chains, and that can be   compared to flow data.",
