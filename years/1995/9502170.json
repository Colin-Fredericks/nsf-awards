The objective  of  his  research  is  to  link common soil  characteristics  to  the  specific  phase  distribution and accessibility or extractability  of  nonvolatile  organic  chemicals in soil-water  systems.   His  secondary  objective is to evaluate supercritical carbon  dioxide  extraction   as   a   laboratory-based  analytical   method   for  decontamination   of   soil  groundwater.    The   investigator's  education plan involves activities that will help him to maintain  a  career-long  focus  on  educational advances  in  science  and  engineering.   He  plans to address this by developing  a  viable  research group at all academic levels and presenting courses that  are  consistent  with  his research interests,  departmental  and  accreditation issues and developing courses that integrate theory  and technology for researchers and practicing engineers.    Results  of this investigator's research are expected to  improve  the  engineering  design  of procedures  to  decontaminate  soil.  Targeted  results  include correlations  of  soil  properties  to  predict    their   responsive   behavior   when   subjected    to  decontamination procedures.  This investigator's educational plan  is  expected  to result in improved approaches to integration  of  advances in knowledge gained from his research into the education  of  engineers  and  to  continue his  participation  in  outreach  programs  for  local pre-college students and  displaced  defense  workers.  ***",
