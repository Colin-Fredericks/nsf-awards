 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal of this CAREER project is the formal  specification and verification of algorithms that support the  implementation of  programming languages.  Such formal systems  can aid the development of new  languages and efficient  implementation of these languages.  This support arises  from both  the verification of algorithms, which increases confidence in the  correctness of a compiler, and from the improved understanding of  compilation  techniques allowed by formal specification.  Recent  work has focused on using  logical frameworks and mechanized proof  assistants to specify deductive systems  representing aspects of  compilation and to verify the correctness of these  specifications.  This research project extends these results  by considering  advanced, state-of-the-art algorithms found in  current compilers, formalizing  theories for these algorithms, and  verifying the correctness of these  algorithms.  One specific  problem area to be addressed involves closure  conversion  algorithms and the concept of `safe-for-space complexity.`  An  important aspect of this project is extending the use of  mechanized proof  assistants to support the verification of  complex flow analyses and  optimizations of programs.    The goal of the education plan is to provide both  a general, but  rigorous, introduction to the study of programming languages at  the undergraduate level and  would  introduce, at both the undergraduate and graduate  level, the  recently emerging field of logic and computation which studies  the  relationship between constructive logics and typed lambda  calculi.  Although  this is typically considered advanced material  and not suitable for  undergraduates, it can be made accessible to  students.",
