 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508040  SAMMIS     This research is to test a theory of the process leading to  earthquake failure in which a power law time-to-failure equation  can be derived from renormalization group theory where the  mainshock is viewed as a critical point.  There is some evidence  that the earthquake preparation process involves the collective  behavior of a spatially extended regional fault network.  For  example, many large earthquakes are preceded by an increase in the  number of intermediate sized events within a large region  surrounding the main shock.  The advantage of the renormalization  group theory treatment is that the first order correction to  scaling can be derived which takes the form of a periodic function  of the logarithm of the time to failure, and which modulates a  power law increase in pre-event seismicity.  This log-periodic  correction is evident in the regional seismicity data which  preceded the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.  The analysis will  continue with the Loma Prieta data and be extended to other  California sites and the Aleutian Islands. This research is a  component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***",
