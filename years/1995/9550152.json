 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is a continuation of work begun under a National  Institutes of Health grant to Dr. Lillard to examine young  children's understanding of pretense.  This issue has recently  become of critical interest in the realm of early social  understanding, as many think pretending might be the venue by which  understanding the mind proceeds.  Dr. Lillard's past work suggests  that children do not in fact have a good grasp of the mental  underpinnings of pretense, whereas some very recent work coming  from other laboratories suggests perhaps they do.  The four  research studies being carried out are designed to address these  discrepancies.    The interactive activities include a speaker series bringing five  top women psychologists to the department, and a discussion series  for women graduate students addressing professional development  issues pertinent to women in psychology.  Dr. Lillard will also run  a graduate level seminar on pretend play and understanding the  mind.",
