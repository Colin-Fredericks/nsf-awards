 "awd_abstract_narration": "White       The investigator studies the structure of closed circular  DNA.  The theoretical approach employs displacement based Finite  Element Analysis (FEA), a well-established technique for obtaining  solutions to engineering problems in nonlinear solid mechanics.  FEA is used to describe closed DNAs containing multiple coplanar  bends that are in-phase; containing bends that do not lie in the  same plane; and containing bends are distributed both  symmetrically and asymmetrically.  It is predicted that the twist  distribution is uniform throughout the regions between the bends;  that the fraction of the linking number change (DLk) converted  into writhe increases with the number of bends; and that the  regional contribution to the writhe increases if the bends are  clustered in that region.  Methods are devised for solving the  problem of avoidance of passage of the DNA strand through itself  as DLk becomes greater than 12.  This includes a novel approach,  the use of special contact elements (gap elements).  These have the  property that when the gap distance reduces to some specified  value, nodal motion constraints are relaxed if the nodes  subsequently tend to separate.  Finally, methods are developed for  decomposing changes in DLk into changes in writhe and twist.  Biologically, closed circular DNA is one of the most important  structural forms of DNA.  This includes not only free DNA  molecules, such as the plasmids used in all genetic engineering  experiments, but chromatin as well, which is now known to be  divided into domains of supercoiling.  Bent regions in DNA appear  to be significant in regulating the initiating of transcription.  This project provides the physical basis for understanding the  combined effects of these two structures.       DNA is not only a repository for genetic information but also  is involved in many aspects of the expression of this information.  For example, it is often necessary to bring together portions of  the DNA molecule that lie at considerable  distances from each  other along the DNA contour.  This juxtaposition of distant genetic  elements makes possible the expression of biological information  that is not otherwise possible.  This process is accomplished by  forming a loop, in which the two elements that are to be brought  together interact at the site of loop closure.  The bringing  together of these distant genes depends in a sensitive way upon  the length of the DNA piece that separates them and upon the  helical periodicity.  This project shows how the presence of  internal bends in DNA within the loop fundamentally changes how  distant segments are brought together.  The distribution of these  internal bends can thus have profound biological consequences.",
