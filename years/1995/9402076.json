The  significance of the proposed activity is that it provides the  Hochschild complex with very rich algebraic structures extending  the bilinear cup product and bracket that define a Gerstenhaber  algebra structure on the Hochschild cohomology.  Those new  structures involve higher multilinear products and brackets.  More  precisely, the structure extending the bracket is expected to be  similar to the homotopy Lie algebra structure, which plays a very  important role in different branches of physics and mathematics.   Such structures have been used by Stasheff and May in their study  of loop spaces, Beilinson and Ginzburg and Hinich and Schechtman in  the study of deformation theory of algebraic varieties and vector  bundles, and by Kontsevich in his study of knot invariants.   Physicists Witten and Zwiebach have effectively used the homotopy  Lie structure in string theory.  The conjecture itself may be  reformulated as the existence of a canonical string theory  associated to every associative algebra.       The conjecture indicates deep connections between algebra and  complex analysis.  Connections between different branches of  mathematics are known to create a lot of excitement and lead to  most important discoveries in mathematics.  The best recent example  may be the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, which establishes a bridge  between number theory and analysis.  The recent work of Wiles  towards the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture has had many important  implications, including his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  ***",
