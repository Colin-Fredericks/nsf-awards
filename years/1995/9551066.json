 "awd_abstract_narration": "The teaching of mechanics and motion in introductory physics has  produced disappointing results that imply that most students  leave the course with only a primitive understanding of the  motion of objects.   In this project, recently developed video  technology is used in an inquiry-based, laboratory-lecture format  to improve students' learning of the fundamental ideas of  Newtonian mechanics.   The students record the trajectory of an  object with a low-cost video camera, digitize and record the data  on a computer, and then analyze the observed motion  frame-by-frame to discover the features of the observed  phenomenon.   This procedure directly confronts students'  preconceptions about motion; measure the same quantities that are  used to describe motion in the classroom, such as the  time-dependent position of a projectile; and make new and  challenging phenomena accessible in the introductory physics  laboratory.   Before now, the methods employed in this project  were too costly to allow students to collect and analyze their  own data in an introductory physics laboratory.   In addition,  the method is flexible and easy to use, an essential practical  ingredient in an inquiry-based laboratory.  The audience targeted  in this project is all students who take introductory physics.    These students are from all scientific disciplines (physics to  sport science) and from all classes (first year to seniors).     The project implements the use of these video technologies in an  environment where the students are involved in both recording the  video and analyzing it.   The students can investigate a variety  of phenomena that because of technical or cost barriers cannot be  addressed in the traditional undergraduate laboratory.",
