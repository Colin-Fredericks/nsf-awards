 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of sex equality, gender attitudes and quality of relationship in Russian marriages, interviewing a random sample of 1400 households in Moscow and its rural environs.  Russia today presents a curious mix of ideology and attitudes making it an important setting for research on changing power relationships between the sexes.  The contradictory factors include: the heritage of the Communist regime which supposed gender equality; the presence of an entrenched patriarchy and general lack of awareness of socially constructed elements of gender difference; and the recent return to subjugating women in the family.  The theory to be tested predicts that when spouses have traditional gender attitudes and wife's occupational prestige, educational achievement or income are equal or superior to husband's, partners will experience lower marital quality and the wife will be more at risk for abuse.  If the spouses have liberal gender attitudes, the theory predicts, equal or superior wife status will not diminish their marital quality.  In addition to testing this and related theories, the project will provide baseline information about the quality of Russian marriages that will be valuable for future studies.  %%%   The large-scale processes of democratization and market transition occurring in Russia and many other nations have serious consequences on the small scale of family units.  It may be the case that greater democracy at the level of the society produces, at least for the duration of a transition period, less democracy within families.  Or, it may be that the short-term consequences for families of democratization may depend in large part upon the attitudes that family members bring to their relationships with each other.  Thus, this study will test general scientific theories about the effect of great social stress on families, as well as providing a much clearer picture of Russian marriages in this time of great challenge for their society.",
