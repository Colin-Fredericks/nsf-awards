In addition to the  population genetic survey, the study will determine size-  specific allozyme frequencies in several populations of sea  urchins sampled three times over an eighteen month period in  order to asses contemporary levels of interpopulation gene  flow.  The research seeks to fill two important questions in  the understanding of the population structure of marine  invertebrates: 1)  To what extent are biogeographic  boundaries reflected in the genetic structure of species  which span the boundaries?  and  2) Are patterns of genetic  differentiation best explained by impediments of gene flow  among specific populations, by ongoing natural selection, or  by some combination of these processes?  Analysis of sources  of recruits to local populations and the viability of  immigrants moving between populations is poorly understood  in most marine populations.  Yet such an understanding is  essential to the effective management of marine biotic  resources.  The data from this study will be used to  initiate an intensive population genetic analysis required  to address the issues mentioned above.  Such analyses are  especially timely in the case of the red urchin, which  currently faces intense predation pressure over much of the  California Coast - from sea otters in central California and  from human fishing activities in other regions.  S.  franciscanus now supports one of the most valuable  invertebrate fisheries on the California coast.",
