 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)  will convene a conference to set an agenda for research and  future activities for teaching science and mathematics to K-12  students with learning disabilities (LD).  Conference  participants will be invited from three groups of experts:   teachers who have successfully taught science and mathematics to  precollege and post-secondary students with LD; neuroscientists;  and cognitive scientists.    Neuroscientists will explain the physical workings of the human  brain in the context of learning and conscious knowing, how the  brain bypasses dysfunctional pathways, and new technologies  that help us understand the brain.  Cognitive scientists will  explain how people generally learn and how people with LD learn  differently.  Teachers will discuss the tests that measure  various learning limitations and the successful strategies they  use in teaching science and mathematics to K-12 students with  those limitations.  Participants will be directed to develop the  agenda for the future.    The primary goals of the conference are:  1) identification of  barriers that prevent K-12 students with learning disabilities  from fully participating in science, mathematics, engineering and  technology (SMET) educational opportunities; 2) the development  of an agenda for research and future activities to remove the  barriers;  3) the dissemination of the collective expertise of  conference participants to interested staff at NSF and AAAS, to  each other, and to other leaders in the LD education community.    Secondary goals include:  1) a contribution to efforts to assure  equal access to science and mathematics learning for students  with learning disabilities by fostering a cross-disciplinary  approach to the underlying problems; 2)  creation of a core group  of experts to address the educational needs of students with LD  over a long period of time in the future.",
