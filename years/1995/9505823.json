 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9505823  Rosenberg  The University of Maryland will continue their studies of the high  magnetic latitude ionosphere and magnetosphere using galactic radio  noise absorption techniques (riometry).  Several years ago, they  developed a new imaging riometer which allows the study of auroral  morphology during daylight and through clouds.  These imaging  riometers are now being operated at Iqiluit, Canada;  Sondestromfjord, Greenland; and South Pole, Antarctica.   Additionally, they are operating broad beam riometers at Iqaluit,  McMurdo and South Pole as well as auroral photometers at McMurdo  and South Pole.  In the next few years they will provide part of  the hardware necessary to build imaging riometers at the British  Halley Bay and the Australian Davis stations, both in Antarctica,  thus considerably extending coverage.    The riometers work synergistically with a number of other  instruments which are operated at these sites by other  investigators.  A major focus of investigations over the next few  years will be the characterization of drifting polar auroral  patches and their relationship to polar cap convection.  ***",
