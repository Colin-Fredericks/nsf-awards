 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to acquire equipment to create a  Transgenic Mouse Facility at Georgetown University (GU). During the  past 10 years, GU has undergone dramatic expansion of its funded  research in the basic Life Sciences. This has allowed undertaking of a  large scale expansion of its rodent viral antigen-free Research  Resources Facility (RRF) animal facility under direction of Dr. Stephen  P. Schiffer, DVM. A strong need to provide a facility for production,  characterization, breeding, and transfer of transgenic mice has arisen  as the power of this type of experimental model has become evident.  Transgenic mouse technology allows the generation of mouse strains  expressing a gene(s) of interest in a specified range of cell types and  in a specified window in time or development, depending upon the  promoter of the gene. The technique can allow profound insights into  gene regulation and gene function in a normal physiological context. A  transgenic mouse facility does not currently exist at Georgetown  University. Our proposed facility will produce transgenic mouse strains  at competitive costs for University investigators in relevant basic  science departments and interdisciplinary programs (Neuroscience, Cell  Biology, Microbiology and Immunology, Physiology and Biophysics,  Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pathology and  Biology). The facility will become a critical feature of graduate (and  undergraduate training) programs in each of the above mentioned fields  of study, and will train new faculty as well. The fundamental research  projects to be supported by the facility include studies on gene  function and regulation in the biological processes of cell division,  cell death, and cell differentiation. Specifically, transgenic mouse  research projects from four interdisciplinary focus groups of faculty  are identified in the areas of Immunology, Neurobiology, Developmental  Biology and Reproductive Biology. In addition, we have created a unique  Biotechno logy exchange agreement with the Jackson Laboratory (Bar  Harbor, ME) whereby the Jackson Laboratory will serve as a respository  and distribution for new strains of mice generated by our facility and  our facility will receive strains of interest and technical advice from  the Jackson Laboratory. Leadership of the facility include Robert B.  Dickson, PhD, Professor of Cell Biology and Pharmacology; Stephen P.  Schiffer, DVM, Director, RRF Animal Facility; and Glenn T. Merlino,  Adjunct Associate Professor of Pathology. The facility will be overseen  by a committee of basic scientists from Georgetown University with a  research interest in Transgenic Mouse Technology and its applications.",
