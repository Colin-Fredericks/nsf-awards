 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recognition of the many challenges that environmental  problems pose, and the dire need for trained scientists and  management personnel in this field, the grantee will  initiate an REU Site program with an ecology /environment  theme via a collaborative effort between New Mexico State  University (NMSU) and Howard University (HU).  Their  goal  is to provide a multi-cultural group of students with a  rigorous research experience in ecology/environmental  biology during an eight-week summer period, followed by a 10  day visit to Washington, DC where they will be exposed to  work being done by environmental agencies.  At NMSU, groups  of 3 or 4 students will collaborate in data collection on an  original research project; each student will be responsible  for analyzing and presenting a unique subset of the data at  a mini-symposium.  During meetings with their group  mentor(s) students will discuss relevant literature,  problems encountered, and new hypotheses and experimental  designs for others to test in future years.  While at NMSU,  a series of visitors knowledgeable in environmental problems  specific to the southwest will speak  informally with the  entire group.  Discussions will encompass many topics of  particular interest to minority groups including  environmental justice and how cultural perceptions affect  interpretation of environmental  problems and implementation  of appropriate policies.  Next the entire group will visit  HU where formal lectures on environmental policy, justice  and related issues will be presented.  The group will also  tour governmental and non-governmental agencies where they  will meet representatives concerned  with environmental  problems.  This experience will not only make the students  more aware of how ecological research is used to make policy  decisions but will provide them with knowledge od job  opportunities in environmental biology.",
