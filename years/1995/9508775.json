These   programs will strengthen the links between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of   doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both academia and industry.   The postdoctoral fellow will work under the direction of Joseph Langsom at   Morgan Stanley Co. and Marco Avellaneda at the Courant Institute of Mathematical   Sciences, New York University. The research concerns models for the dynamics interest   rates and applications to pricing and hedging interest-rate derivative securities, such as call   and put options on U.S. Treasury bonds. This activity touches upon several areas of   applied mathematics, including analysis of multidimensional stochastic differential   equations, linear and nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations, numerical modeling   and Monte Carlo simulation.",
