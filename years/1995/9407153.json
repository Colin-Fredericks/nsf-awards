 "awd_abstract_narration": "9407153  Courtney   Net-winged midges (Diptera: Blephariceridae) are a distinctive, specialized, and unusual group of insects.  The group has a world-wide distribution and includes approximately 300 described species.  Because of their unusual morphology and intimate association with clean, cold, rapidly flowing streams, net-winged midges have been of interest to morphologists, systematists, and ecologists; yet these flies are one of the most under-appreciated groups of aquatic insects.  Recent studies have shown that the larvae of these insects are significant to stream ecosystems, not only as consumers of algae but also as food for vertebrate predators (e.g. trout).  Because net-winged midges are a diverse, widespread group with individuals short-lived and closely associated with mountain streams, their patterns of speciation and distribution should closely reflect historical events (e.g. mountain building, glaciation).  These attributes make net-winged midges a model taxon for studies of the relationships and biogeography of montane and aquatic organisms.   This study of the systematics, cytogenetics, and life histories of North American species in the genus Blepharicera will 1) examine the taxonomy, relationships and biogeography of native species; 2) analyze the chromosomes of Blepharicera populations for relationships and cryptic or sibling species; 3) test for congruence between chromosomal and traditional morphological characters; and 4) compare and contrast the life histories of North American Belpharicera, in order to identify isolating mechanisms in species and sibling species.  By incorporating all of these objectives into a single investigation, this will be one of the most comprehensive systematic studies of any group of aquatic flies.   The significance of this research extends well beyond systematics, genetics, and ecology of an unusual group of aquatic flies.  Because of their dependence on cold, clean, well-oxygenated water, net-winged midges hold considerable promise as bioind icators of stream quality.  However, such determinations require baseline information on biodiversity, distribution and biology of net-winged midges and associated organisms.  This study will provide these data and identify sites of taxonomic and biogeographic significance.  Simultaneously, the results of this study will provide insights into management and conservation practices for mountain streams in North America.",
