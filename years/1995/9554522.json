 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9554522  Donoghue  This program will provide broad  graduate training in plant  systematics, thereby addressing  widely recognized needs in plant  biology and environmental biology.  The Department of Organismic and  Evolutionary Biology (OEB) is  ideally suited to provide this  training. Eight OEB faculty (three  newly appointed) will be primary  participants in the program, along  with five associated personnel from  outside the department. New  molecular laboratories complement  the strengths, and growing interest  on the part of outstanding  applicants, the development of a  plant systematics program has been  hindered by limitations on internal  funding. The program will bring  eight new students into the  department and will provide  flexible funding for other students  to ensure broad training and timely  completion of the PhD. A rotation  scheme and several new courses will  be initiated, targeting  morphological and molecular  techniques and the teaching of  plant systematics. Harvard will  augment NSF funding by  supplementing tuition and providing  field research assistantships,  herbarium traineeships, and  resources for the new courses,  workshops, rotations, and  recruitment activities. The  participating faculty will allocate  GRT funds to meet these goals and  will coordinate efforts to recruit  and retain underrepresented  minority students.",
