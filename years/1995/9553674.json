 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southeast Community College (SCC) will establish a National  Center of Excellence for Chemistry-Based Technician Education at  its Lincoln, Nebraska, campus.  Through this center, SCC will  coordinate and direct a comprehensive curriculum and educational  materials development project for chemistry-based technician  education.  The new curriculum will be developed for associate  degree programs with input from a national consortium of employed  technicians, business and industry representatives, community  college and high school instructors, university professors, and the  American Chemical Society's National Voluntary Industry Standards  project.  A new curriculum will also be developed for those already  employed as chemistry technicians following a comprehensive survey  of as many employed technicians as can be reached nationally with  the help of local alliances and the American Chemical Society's  Division of Chemical Technicians.  Both traditional and  technologically advanced educational materials will be developed  for all curriculum projects and published and/or distributed for  the purpose of delivering the new curricula in a manner consistent  with modern educational theories and systems.  Workshops for the  enhancement of high school and community college faculty will be  held during the summers in cooperation with local industries.   Topics of the workshops will center around the modern work place  and associated instrumentation and technologies community colleges  use in the training of technicians.  Marketing of chemistry  technology as a career will be addressed, with special attention  given to underrepresented groups,  To help the center achieve these  goals, all chemistry technician training programs, their students  and graduates, the business and industrial communities they serve,  and the feeder high schools in their areas will be united into a  national community college network centered at SCC.  The entire  project will be guided by a national advisory board and a s teering  committee.",
