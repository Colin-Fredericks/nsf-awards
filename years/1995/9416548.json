Previous  research has found that variation in population density will  affect the relationship between gamete production and  reproductive success differently in male and female-phase  colonies.  The relationship between production and the  number of fertilization obtained by a colony is expected to  be linear in competitive situations (high population  densities), but plateau in noncompetitive situations (low  population densities) at the male gamete production level  that allows a male to fertilize all of the eggs in his  vicinity.  In contrast, the relationship between egg  production and the number of offspring produced by a colony  is expected to be linear at low population densities (where  male gamete limit the number of eggs fertilized), but  plateau at high population densities due to constraints on  the number of embryos that colonies can brood.   These  hypotheses will be tested in this research project by  establishing experimental populations of ascidians that vary  in gamete production under two density conditions and  assaying male and female reproductive success.  Male  reproductive success will be assayed by using allozyme  markers to assign paternity, while female reproductive  success will be assayed by directly counting the proportion  of eggs fertilized in each brood .  This study will  contribute to our knowledge of benthic marine organisms by  examining the selective pressures that fertilization  processes can exert on gamete allocation patterns.",
