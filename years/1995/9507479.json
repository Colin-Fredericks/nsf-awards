 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507479    Coordinated  movement  requires  both  a  neural  plan   and  information about the biomechanics of muscles and  skeleton.  The implementation of the plan is a pattern of activation of  motor  neurons and muscles that produces the movement.   The  goal  of this research is to understand the construction  of  implementation patterns that control complex  movement,  and  the  biomechanical constraints under which they  work.   The  model system is prey capture by frogs.  Prey capture is easy  to  stimulate  in the laboratory, and is a complex  movement  that  requires  rapid  coordination  of  several  pairs   of  antagonistic  muscles. The research uses a multidisciplinary  approach   combining   biomechanics  and   neurobiology   to  determine  how  the  design  of the  musculoskeletal  system  interacts   with   muscle  activity  to  produce   movement.  Comparisons within and between species that differ  in  size  will  show  how  muscle activity and movement  patterns  are  related  to  body size among animals of similar  shape.  The  morphology   of   the  feeding  apparatus,   the   movements  associated with feeding behavior, and the pattern of  muscle  activation  will be analyzed simultaneously.  These  studies  will  provide insight into how muscle activation  strategies  change  with  body  size.  A second  approach  will  compare  musculoskeletal  design, muscle activity, movement  patterns  and  feeding performance among species that differ in shape.  This   will  show  how  musculoskeletal  design  and  muscle  activity   patterns  have  evolved  to  produce   particular  movement  patterns  and  performance  characteristics   like  speed,  accuracy,  and  efficiency.  The  results  of   this  research will have broad implications for understanding  the  neural control of movement and its evolution.",
