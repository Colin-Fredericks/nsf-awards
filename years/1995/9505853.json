 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is evaluating a new architectural paradigm that can  extract and exploit the parallelism in sequential code.  This new  approach uses both software scheduling in the compiler, as in VLIW,  and hardware scheduling at run-time, as in superscalar  architectures.  The compiler segments code into large blocks of  instructions that form subgraphs of the control-flow graph, though  not necessarily basic blocks.  The compiler appends synchronization  information to each block that describes which registers must be  shared with blocks.  The compiler appends synchronization  information to each block that describes which registers must be  shared with other blocks.  The blocks or tasks are passed to  separate identical parallel execution units, each of which executes  its task sequentially.  Tasks are scheduled optimistically, so that  some tasks may be executed by a unit when they would not be  executed in a sequential system; in such cases, the tasks are  \"squashed,\" which means that their results are not written to  memory or registers.  At the end of each task, it blocks until the  system determines that the task will not be squashed; at that time  results are committed.  The collection of execution units appears  logically to be one unit, with a single register file.  Shared  register values are passed on an inter-execution-unit network, and  tasks that need shared values block until the values are produced.    During the first two years of this award is devoted to compiler  design for the new architecture, to comparison with other  architectures using simulation, and to conceptual refinement of the  architecture.  During later years, work is expected to focus on  implementation.",
