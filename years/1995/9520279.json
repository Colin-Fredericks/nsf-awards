The filling of the tube    increases the stiffness and    strength of the system.  This    form of construction also    produces a very cost effective    structural system by combining    the attributes of structural    steel (speed of construction,    strength, long-span capability,    lightweight) and concrete    (stiffness, damping, economy),    where the tube provides a    convenient formwork for placing    the concrete.  One of the key    elements in this type of    construction is the structural    connection between the beam and    column.  As part of a lateral    seismic load resistant system    the connection would be expected    to be capable of transferring    beam forces and moments to the    columns.  The behavior of    connections is typically complex    due to the inelastic, non-    uniform, combined stress states    that develop under loading.    There presently is still a lack    of knowledge related to the    seismic performance and    guidelines for seismic    resistance design of CFT    composite construction,    particularly for connections.    This study will focus on the    seismic behavior of moment    connections for CFT square    column composite structural    systems.  The objectives are to:    (1) study the force and moment    transfer mechanism between the    beams and a adjacent column, and    the influence connection details    have on this mechanism; (2)    develop connection details that    perform well under seismic    conditions, and are cost    effective; and (3) develop    design guidelines for    implementing the details in    practice.    The analytical investigation    will consists of two parts.  The    first part will involve    conducting nonlinear time    history seismic analysis of open    CFT column composite systems.    The second part will entail    conducting nonlinear finite    element ana lysis of the    connection in order to assess    the affects various structural    details have on the force and    moment transfer mechanism and    capacity of the connection.    Affects of concrete crushing,    steel tube local buckling, and    panel zone deformation on    connection performance will be    assessed.  The experimental    program will involve the    construction and testing of full    scale beam column sub-    assemblages for seismic loading    conditions.  These sub-    assemblages will resemble the    beam and column members and    their connection in the interior    joint region of the prototype    theme structure.  Each    connection in a test specimen    will consist of an innovative    design, where the ductility    demand and information on    connection details obtained from    the analytical study will be    used to formulate these designs.    The results from the    experimental and analytical    programs will then be used to    formulate the design guidelines.    This is a project supported    under the year 1 program of the    Civil Infrastructure Systems    (CIS) solicitation NSF 94-154.        ***",
