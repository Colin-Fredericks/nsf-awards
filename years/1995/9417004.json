 "awd_abstract_narration": "August 2, 19959417004  Datta  The research proposed here addresses fundamental problems in  three distinct areas: a)Robust Control with an emphasis on  parametric uncertainty  b)Adaptive Control with an emphasis on  robustness and performance issues and c)Robust Adaptive Control  with the thrust being the development of new quantitative  analysis and design methods exploiting the recent explosion of  results obtained using Kharitonov's Theorem and its extensions.    First, we intend to develop \"best case\" results involving the  parametric stability margin, Hoo stability margin (norm), gain  and phase margins over a parametrized set of transfer functions,  such as an interval plant.  These robustness results in the area  of Robust Parametric Stability, would then be used for non-  conservatively quantifying the robustness of adaptive control  schemes.  The second objective is to develop extremal parametric  results involving the H2 and L1 norms which, we believe, will  play an important role in studying adaptive system performance.   The third objective is to address some important open problems in  each of the areas of adaptive control and robust parametric  stability.    The objectives mentioned above are motivated from our prior  research which has not only enabled us to identify some of the  outstanding unresolved problems in the areas of adaptive control  and robust parametric stability, but has also highlighted the  need for inter-twined research efforts in these two traditionally  very diverse fields.  None of the existing theory in either of  these fields can solve the problems related to this proposal in a  practical or satisfactory manner.  However, successful resolution  of these problems is imperative from both a theoretical and a  practical point of view.  Indeed, practitioners of both robust  and adaptive control stand to benefit a lot from the \"non-  conservative\" parametric L1 and Hoo robustness results that we  seek to develop.   ***",
