 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two of the most powerful factors shaping the 20th century have been war and the environment.  Traditionally, however, researchers have treated these issues as separate.  Dr. Russell asks whether this separation is the right approach.  He cites the history of chemical weapons and the parallel history of insecticides to argue that we should not separate these subjects.  Efforts to control national and natural enemies are linked, he argues, on at least three levels.  The first is technology.  Beginning in World War I, chemical compounds shuttled between battle fields and farm fields.  In Gerhard Schrader's laboratory, nerve gases and insecticides entered the world as fraternal twins.  The second is institutions.  Nation states harnessed military and civilian institutions in tandem to develop chemicals for war and peace.  The third was metaphor.  Soldiers and scientists shaped the way people experience war and nature through shared metaphors.  In World War II, for example, military and civilian publications published cartoons of half-Japanese, half-insect creatures and called for \"annihilation\" of both. These developments helped produce some of the most exciting, and the most tragic, events of this century.  Humans used a poison chemical to boost crop yields and free themselves from disease, but they also used the same compound to try to \"exterminate\" human beings.    Dr. Russell is organizing his research around case studies of institutions representing military, civilian, scientific and industrial interests.  His results promise to advance our understanding of interactions between science, technology and society, between military and civilian endeavors, and between humans and nature.  They also promise to inform debates about pest control, arms control, dual use technology and environmental policy.    Dr. Russell's  is using his research to help train students in  the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Virginia.  Hi is developing a module on environmental issues for use  in courses required of all fourth year students.  He is also developing two electives in environmental history and environmental problems and policies.",
