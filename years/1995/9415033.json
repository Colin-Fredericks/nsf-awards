 "awd_abstract_narration": "South Carolina State University (SCSU) is the only state supported Historically Black College or University in South Carolina.  The university ranks tenth in the nation for sending African Americans on to graduate schools in science and mathematics.  Recognizing the need to improve the physical infrastructure on campus, SCSU and the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will jointly provide resources to renovate Hodge Hall, the science building. Current research and research training are hampered by the physical and environmental limitations of  laboratories and computing facilities.  Constructed in 1928, the building was not designed initially to house scientific programs and, therefore, lacks the utilities required to support research investigations in Engineering, Biology, Physics, and Chemistry. As a major part of the renovation, the heating and cooling system, water drainage and plumbing systems, ventilation, electrical, and mechanical systems will be upgraded.  Safety, energy conservation, and special needs will also be addressed.  Upon completion, the renovated facility will provide a conducive research environment necessary to move the university effectively towards its goal of increasing research emphasis and capabilities in established programs. Quality space will be provided for faculty as will dedicated research training space for students.   Laboratories, dedicated to studies in plant science, genetics, microbiology, ecology, trace metal analysis,  porphyrin chemistry, and high temperature superconductivity, will be housed in the newly renovated Hodge Hall.  Research training space will also be provided for the NSF-Alliance for Minority Participation Program.  These improvements will be  instrumental in assisting the science department in attracting new faculty and increase the number of  high caliber  minority students pursuing careers in science and engineering.",
