 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508620  Bose         The spark generated by Kharitonov's result on root  clustering of interval polynomials has influenced the robust  control field in a significant manner in a relatively short time.  The property studied in the setting of Kharitonov theory and its  various generalizations is primarily concerned with robust  stability of continuous-time and discrete-time one dimensional  systems and, to a lesser extent, multidimensional systems.  The  achieving of robust stability is crucial in the design of control  systems when a plant, possibly of high order and with uncertain  parameters present is targeted for stabilization by a low order  compensator.  In the control of flexible large space structures  such as solar power satellites and orbiting telescopes,  for example, the objective is to achieve robust control of a  plant of high order with a controller of lower order.  Robust  control is necessary because of elastic mode truncation  (modelling error) and parameter uncertainty.  The effect of mode  truncation is possible instability due to the incorporated either  in the plant transfer matrix representation or the state-space  representation.  Usually, the coefficient perturbations will not  be independent of each other so that the Kharitonov-type results,  if used without any modification, would have the advantage of  simplicity in application but the disadvantage of yielding only  sufficient conditions, which may not be as tight as desired for  robust stability.  Furthermore, though robust stability is  crucial to performance evaluation of control systems, other  measures of performance like robust frequency response, robust  pole placement, and minimax control or rate feedback systems are  necessary in important applications like control of large space  structures.  ***",
