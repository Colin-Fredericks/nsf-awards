 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient communication is central to parallel computing.  Modern  multiprocessors obtain high bandwidth, low latency user-level  communication through special hardware support, often implemented  as a  dedicated communications co-processor.  Future parallel  machines, including  high performance networks of workstations,  will be built using communications  co-processors.    The goal of this research is to study how the presence of a  dedicated co-processor affects the performance of interprocesor  communication  in modern parallel machines.  In particular, the  project focuses on two  aspects.    First, it studies the impact of communications co-processors on  the performance of various communication primitives and  determines the  architectural requirements for implementing  efficiently many-to-one  communication such as active messages.    Second, it studies how the  communications so-processor can be  captured by a theoretical performance model.  The goal is to  derive a performance model that is realistic enough to  characterize machines and accurately predict performance, but  still simple  enough to be used in designing and analyzing  parallel algorithms.    To study  these questions, the project takes a vertical approach,  spanning theory,  applications, languages, systems software, and  architecture.  The project  constructs a complete system which  allows taking an in-depth look at how  efficient communication  affects all of these layers.  The project leverages off  the work  on active messages, the parallel languages Split-C, and the LogP  performance model, developed at UC Berkeley.  The main  experimental platform is  a 64-processor Meiko CS-2, which the  UCSB Computer Science Department acquired  through an NSF CISE  infrastructure grant.  The CS-2 reflects, a modern high-  performance network of workstation enthronement equipped with  communications  co-pocessors, making it extremely well suited for  the study. The principal  investigator has already implemented  active mess ages and Split-C on the CS-2.  The project develops a realistic model for parallel computation  which captures  the capabilities of communication co-processors.  To create a framework to  characterize communication and measure  its performance, the project implements  a simulator based on this  model as well as a Split-C profiler.  This framework  is used to  fine-tune applications and for architectural studies.  Besides  answering these important research questions, the work also  provides  infrastructure which is used for teaching purposes as  well as by other  researchers.    The principal investigator ismstriving for a well balanced  career  as a professor in computer science, combining teaching and  research.  His areas of interest are parallel computing, computer  architecture, languages,  and compilers.  His educational  objective is to teach students in these fields,  to get them  excited about computer science and engineering, and to prepare  them for a successful professional career.",
