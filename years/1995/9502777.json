 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502777  Faust  Kinetic and mechanistic studies on the additions of 1,1-  diphenylethylene and related highly reactive but non-  polymerizable monomers to living cationic polymers will be  carried out.  Conductance measurement and UV-vis  spectroscopy combined with structure analysis will determine  the kinetics and mode of addition, the extent of chain end  ionization and dissociation.  The kinetics of the addition  of diphenylcarbenium ions to monomers will also be studied,  and the absolute rate constants will be determined for free  ions and ion-pairs.  The results will be used in the  synthesis of well-defined block copolymers by sequential  monomer addition when the reactivity of the second monomer  is higher then that of the first monomer.  The method  involves capping with a reactive but non-polymerizable  monomer such as 1,1-diphenylethylene, followed by tailoring  the Lewis acidity to the reactivity of the second monomer by  the addition of titanium(IV) alkoxide, by replacing the  Lewis acid with a weaker one or by the use of a common ion  salt.  Another objective of the proposal is to explore the  synthesis of end-functional polymers by in-situ  functionalization (end-quenching) of the living ends.  The  last objective of the proposal is to investigate the  combination of living cationic and living anionic-group  transfer polymerization for the synthesis of linear and  hetero-arm star block copolymers.  Two different methods are  proposed based on 1,1-diphenylethylene capping; one based on  site transformation and the other based on mutual  annihilation of the living polymer cations and anions.  %%%  This research provides a novel approach to the synthesis of  various well-defined polymers with precisely known  architecture.  Such polymers are needed to study the  fundamental physical properties as a function of structure.  ***",
