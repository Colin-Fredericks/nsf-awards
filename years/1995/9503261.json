 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abbott       The investigator studies how the dynamic properties of large  populations of neurons allow them to represent, store, recall and  process information.  A basic theme of the project is the study of  population coding, the storage of information in large arrays of  neurons, each responding fairly nonselectively to different  aspects of a stimulus.  The transfer of information between  neuronal networks is studied using population decoding methods.  Questions to be addressed include: How is the information encoded  in a sensory network transferred to a motor network in a task like  visually guided reaching toward an object?  How do the invariant  representations needed to identify and locate an object  independent of translations, rotations, and scaling changes arise?  It is widely believed that synaptic modification is the basic  neuronal mechanism underlying memory and learning.  Population  decoding methods allow for an interpretation of the effects of  synaptic modification with direct behavioral relevance.  In  preliminary decoding studies it has been found that the temporal  properties of long-term potentiation naturally cause a population  of neurons to predict a coded quantity after training.  This  suggests a novel mechanism for learning and generating sequences  of motor actions that is explored.       Reaching for an object, turning toward a visual or auditory  cue, and a variety of other tasks require motor responses that are  accurately guided by sensory information.  In addition, previous  experience can play an important role in shaping these responses.  Experiments have provided important information about how sensory  information is represented in the brain and how experience can  modify neural circuits.  Mathematical decoding techniques allow us  to relate motor responses, such as reaching, to the activity of  neurons in the motor cortex of the brain.  The goal of the project  is to construct a theoretical framework, based on these data, for  understanding sensory-guid ed motor tasks, including mechanisms for  learning and generating accurate responses and modifying them on  the basis of experience.  This work should provide new insights  into how we generate basic motor behaviors and may have  interesting applications to robotics.",
