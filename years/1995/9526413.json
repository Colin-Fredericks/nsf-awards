 "awd_abstract_narration": "EEC-9526413  Elsayed    This award provides funding for a planning meeting to establish an  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Quality and  Reliability Engineering Research jointly between Rutgers University  and Arizona State University.  The Center will have two locations,  the first is the Industrial Engineering Department of Rutgers  University and the second is the Department of Industrial and  Management Systems Engineering (IMSE) of Arizona State University.   It will supported by local/national industries, Rutgers University,  Arizona State University, and government and state agencies.    The mission of the Center is to conduct research and develop models  of evaluating system performance and improve quality and  reliability of commercial products and military systems.  The  Center's goal is to provide timely, high-quality and cost-effective  research, development, training, seminars and workshops, and  analysis in the quality and reliability areas.    The Center has the necessary elements for success:  1) With  increasing competition and emphasis on the quality of products and  reliability perceived by the customers, there is need for research  that will lead to a strong foundation to support improved quality  and reliability of commercial products and military systems, 2)  There is a strong interest from local and national industry in the  quality and reliability engineering areas, 3) The Center utilizes  the existing strength in quality and reliability engineering and  probabilistic modeling of the faculty of the Department of  Industrial Engineering at Rutgers University and the faculty of the  Department of Industrial and Management Systems Engineering at  Arizona State University, 4) The Center provides cost effective  research and development opportunities for small companies  and  subdivisions of large organizations, and 5) The Center provides  exposure and training for graduate industrial engineering students  in the area of quality and reliability engineering.     This planning meeting will study the feasibility in establishing an  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Quality and  Reliability Engineering.  The goal of the proposed Center is to  conduct research and develop models for evaluating system  performance and improve quality and reliability of commercial and  military productq.     Currently, four companies have expressed interests in supporting  the proposed research activities.  A planning meeting has been  planned in January 1996 to develop a better research plan with  invited companies.      This effort has been coordinated with Dr. Pius Egbelu, Program  Director of the Operations Research and Production Systems Program  in the Division of Design, Manufacture, and Industrial Innovation.",
