CEN is a quarterly publication which provides information on  scholarly developments in China, research access and  opportunities for US researchers, and general information on  science and education policies and institutions.  CEN has  been published since 1972, and serves a wide audience of  readers, many of whom are not familiar with China but who  wish to pursue research collaboration in China.    Despite the proliferation of contacts between the US and  Chinese scientific communities, the development of initial  contacts, research plans, and joint projects is still a  daunting task for scientists who have not worked previously  with Chinese colleagues.  CEN is noted for serving  a vital  function for the US scientific community and for performing  an invaluable service in fostering international research.",
