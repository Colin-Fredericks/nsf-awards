 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports the research and professional development of Professor John Swallow. This project has two primary goals: to find new constructive methods to realize groups as Galois groups, and to advance the use of technology in the undergraduate mathematics classroom. For the first goal, the study will focus on obstructions to central embedding problems. The project will provide new insights into the role of Galois cohomology and computation in exhibiting explicit polynomials with given Galois groups over the field of rational numbers. One specific aim of the educational plan is to write an undergraduate textbook on Galois Theory which will employ modern algebraic computation to present examples efficiently and will replace ruler-and-compass constructions with recent research in the area of explicit construction of fields as an underlying theme.    The research component of this project is in the general area of number theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.",
