To  this end, 48 teachers (grades 5-9) are selected (in teams of  2-4 from each of Peoria's 12 middle and 4 high schools) to  attend a 3 sequential summer teacher enhancement program  that focuses on reflective pedagogy, and content and  technology enhancement.  Each summer consists of a 4-week  institute:  Summer 1 focuses on rational numbers and  proportional reasoning; Summer 2 looks at algebra, stressing  patterns and functions; Summer 3 looks in depth at how to  implement PUMP algebra ideas and techniques, and integrate  them into the curricula that are in place in the  participants' schools.  School year follow-up consists of 6  1/2-day seminars, as well as 4 site visits by PUMP senior  staff to each participating teacher's classes.  The program  involves building principals, and draws on community  resources, such as, for example, an existing Urban League  outreach program for elementary students.  An external  evaluation, complementing on-going internal evaluations,  focuses especially on documenting student change.  To  disseminate the project, 4 selected mid-sized cities around  the country send observers to the project, and some 70  cities are networked by a project newsletter.         Cost sharing is 64% of the NSF contribution.",
