 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416304   Sahai   Thin Strip casting process for stainless and plain carbon steel, and aluminum are under development in companies around the world.  While empirical feasibility has been demonstrated by industrial members, the process is not sufficiently well understood to provide the process parameters for robust manufacturing operation to achieve maximum yield.  In this research, numerical simulation will be carried out and verified with industrial data from both Single Roller as well as Twin Roller Strip Casters in aluminum as well as steel.  The ensuping model can predict the rate of cooling which controls the microstructure which in turn determines the final mechanical properties of the cast strip.  This research will dove tail with similar effort at Temple University and Drexel University.   In the current manufacturing practice, thin steel sheets used to build car bodies and thin aluminum foils used in the kitchen, start as large ingots and are rolled numerous times to bring the thickness down.  This process involves several manufacturing steps consuming lots of energy, adding to work in process (inventory) and slowing delivery to customers.  This novel approach of casting strips directly if well understood and controlled to a high degree of reliability without sacrificing yields has the potential to reduce the manufacturing cost significantly.  International competition is intense since the stakes are high for primary metals industry.  Proposed collaboration with domestic steel and aluminum industrial partners in this research will immensely help both research content and manufacturing relevance.",
