 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523327  Parker       The Colorado School of Mines and Public Service Company of  Colorado propose to develop a passive emission sensor which can  accurately quantify nitric oxide concentrations and gas  temperature in power plant exhaust flows and demonstrate it's  utility as a feedback sensor in an NO control system.  The  technology developed for the NO sensor will also be used to  produce a sensor for ammonia.  Using an upstream monitor for NO  concentration coupled with a downstream monitor for ammonia, a  feedback control system for Thermal DeNOx will be demonstrated in  the laboratory.  In addition, we will work toward implementation  and validation of both sensors in a full scale powerplant.  The  overall measurement system will be non-extractive and will  provide accurate and reproducible measurements of both transient  and steady-state NO concentrations.  In addition, the system  concept is simple and robust; instruments that are suitable for  use in the field, and do not require frequent calibration or  highly trained operators will be the end result of this research  project.  The measurement technique is based on spectrally  resolved emission from nitric oxide and water at wavelengths near  5.2 microns.  Emission from nitric oxide will be used to quantify  NO concentration and water emission will be used to determine the  temperature of the flow.  A scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer  will be used within the device for wavelength selection; this  device can, in principle, operate over a large range of  wavelengths and can be adapted to become a field hardened  instrument.  Investigation on application of the proposed sensor  system principle for measuring other pollutant will be carried  out in this study.  ***",
