Project funding will enable Dr. Shibata to spend one year in Japan, resident at KEK, in order to conduct research in the TOPAZ experiment at the TRISTAN collider at KEK with Dr. Iwata and other U.S. and Japanese physicists.  Dr. Shibata will collaborate in two KEK experimental high energy physics programs that will complement his U.S. research program on the CLEO experiment at Cornell University.  After he returns to the U.S., Dr. Shibata will use his experience gained in Japan for development and constructions work on the recently approved upgrade of the CLEO II detector to CLEO III.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries working in the area of high energy physics.  The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques, equipment, and facilities at KEK as well as contribute to the overall research effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
