Columbia University  Title: Supersonic Aircraft Emission Signals in Satellite & GCMAM  Microwave Maps    Aircraft emissions can potentially change the regional and global  climate through their greenhouse interaction with reaction with  radiation and though their photochemical interaction with ambient  atmospheric species such as ozone.  Supersonic aircraft exhaust  adds water vapor, NOx, CO2, sulfur, soot, and cloud condensation  nuclei to high altitudes (20 km) in the stratosphere.  Current  atmospheric forcing by aircraft emission will no doubt be amplified  by the increased supersonic fleet planned by 2015.  A microwave  radiative transfer model can be enhanced to work with Global  Climate-Middle Atmosphere Model (GCMAM) experiments.  These GCMAM  experiments predicted the atmospheric impacts of water vapor and  ozone perturbations from supersonic aircraft emission.  The  signature of the supersonic ozone and water vapor perturbations can  be sought in NOAA satellites'  Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) data  based on the GCMAM microwave maps produced by microwave radiative  transfer model.  The GCMAM microwave maps can also assess the  progression of changes at different altitudes during the GCMAM's  time integration as compared with actual satellite data.  Finally,  this would lead into future research investigating the importance  of the emission signal relevant to other anthropogenic signals and  to natural variability given current and future satellite  resolution and sensitivity.    This is a Research Planning Grant.",
