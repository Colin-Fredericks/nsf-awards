 "awd_abstract_narration": "The model elimination theorem-proving procedure, like   top-down reasoning procedures, has the defect of repeatedly   solving  the same  goals.  The problem can be ameliorated by lemmas or  caching,   but the  ``upside-down meta-interpretation'' approach to be    investigated offers a more  comprehensive solution that entails  executing the model   elimination procedure  by a bottom-up  reasoning engine, which also enables more   control over search  strategy.    Theory resolution is a framework for   incorporating theories into  a  resolution theorem-proving program, thereby making it    unnecessary to resolve  directly upon axioms of the theory and  improving efficiency.    Although many  ways of incorporating  theories into a resolution theorem   prover can be seen as  instances of theory resolution, theory resolution provides   little  guidance on  how to incorporate theories.  Predicate-and function-matching   rules and a  multilateral representation for residues  in partial theory   resolution are being  developed as methodologies  for using theory resolution.      Numerous previously  open problems in the theory of quasigroups  have been solved   recently by  automated reasoning systems such as  efficient   implementations of the  Davis-Putnam procedure.  In  collaboration with other   automated deduction  researchers and a  mathematician expert on the domain,   additional effort will be  devoted to obtain new results in the theory of quasigroups.",
