 "awd_abstract_narration": "9403395    An improved understanding of the systematics of mantle circulation  is a high scientific priority in solid earth geophysics.  By  mapping the areal distribution of crustal compositions over key  areas of ocean floor, quantitative information about the size,  composition, and distribution of mantle reservoirs, variations in  mantle temperatures, the efficiency of convective stirring in the  mantle, and the longevity of mantle reservoirs can be obtained.   One very important problem of this type, which can be addressed by  surficial sampling and crustal drilling, concerns the origin and  evolution of the distinctive isotopic and geochemical signature of  the Indian Ocean spreading centers are isotopically distinct from  those of the Pacific.  A unique and sharp boundary between Pacific  and isotopic provinces has been identified within the Australian-  Antartic Discordance along the spreading ridge.    The objective of the present project is to map this boundary away  from the ridge crest, since limited available data tends to  indicate a westward migration of the boundary over time.  Seismic  reflection, gravity and magnetic data and dredge samples will be  collected in the off-axis area during a 40 day research cruise in  early 1996.  These data will also provide site-survey information  in support of a proposal to the Ocean Drilling Program to sample  old crust in an attempt to map the history of the boundary.  The  project involves scientists from the University of Washington,  Oregon State University, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.",
