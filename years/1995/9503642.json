 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will initiate a collaborative program of  experimental research, by Vladimir Braginsky's Moscow-  University research group, in support of the Laser  Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)  Project, with special focus on issues relevant to \"advanced\"  interferometers that would operate in the LIGO vacuum system  after the first interferometers have completed their  studies.  Most of the research will focus on suspension systems for  the interferometers' test masses.  Several versions of the  suspension system will be developed and tested in Moscow.  The key goals of this research will be        to achieve the highest possible quality factors Q for  the suspensions' pendulum modes and violin modes (Q's  greater than 108 are expected) with test masses of 1 to 2kg,  and thereby to reduce the thermal noise that the suspension  introduces into LIGO's gravity-wave searches;        to investigate the level of excess noise (non-Gaussian  noise of nonthermal origin) in several versions of the  suspension;        to develop theoretical models to explain the observed  excess noise, and compare those models with the experimental  measurements.  The Moscow group will transfer to the Caltech/MIT LIGO team  the know-how, techniques, and technology for suspension  systems, which they develop.  In addition, they will make  recommendations to the LIGO team about the design of test-  mass systems for advanced interferometers, and will provide  estimates of the thermal noise that the recommended  suspensions would introduce into the interferometers.  The  Moscow group will also provide ongoing advice to the LIGO  team about various aspects of the team's interferometer R&D  program, including the R&D for the first LIGO  interferometers.  In parallel with this experimental work, the Moscow group--  in collaboration with members of Kip Thorne's Caltech group  and possibly with members of the LIGO team--will analyze  various \"Quantum Nondemolition\" readout systems for very  advanced LIGO interf erometers.  These QND readout systems  will have the goal of beating the \"standard quantum limit\"  for interferometer sensitivity.",
