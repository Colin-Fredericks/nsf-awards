 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evans/Abstract         The objective of this research is to increase the  understanding of how cloud structure affects radiative properties  and to improve methods of computing radiative transfer in  inhomogeneous clouds for parameterizations an remote sensing.  This  research will focus on using stochastic radiative transfer, in  which ensemble mean radiative properties are computed directly from  probability distributions that describe cloud inhomogeneity.   Stochastic modeling is appropriate because information about cloud  structure is inherently statistical.  Data from millimeterwave  radars and cloud probes on aircraft will be used to characterize  spatial structure in liquid water clouds, including within cloud  variability, in terms of the stochastic transfer probability  distributions.  Radiative transfer modeling will be done to learn  what aspects of cloud inhomogeneity are most important for the mean  radiative effects and how these may be best expressed with a few  simple parameters.  The modeled radiances and fluxes will be  compared with aircraft and ground based radiometers.  An  approximate method of using these inhomogeneous cloud parameters  for rapidly computing stochastic radiative transfer for use in  cloud radiation parameterizations will be sought.  Deterministic  radiative transfer modeling will also be done to investigate  relationships between the statistics of upwelling radiances and the  underlying inhomogeneity for use in  remote sensing of clouds.",
