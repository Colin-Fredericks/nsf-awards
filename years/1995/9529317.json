 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529317  Cooper    This is an award to support conduct of a symposium the  objective of which is to bring together investigators who  are conducting research on the applications of ionizing  radiation in environmental engineering practice.  The  sources of ionizing radiation to be considered will include  gamma radiation for radioactive substances but will  concentrate on ionizing radiation produced by electron beam  accelerators.  The applications include processing of solid,  liquid and gaseous wastes to reduce their pollutional impact  on land, water and air resources and to improve the  efficiency of other physical, chemical and biological  processes used in waste treatment systems.    This symposium will be conducted in conjunction with the  International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies  that will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from December 17-22,  1995.  The Congress is  sponsored jointly by the Canadian  Society for Chemistry, the Chemical Society of Japan, the  American Chemical Society, the New Zealand Institute of  Chemistry and the Royal Australian Chemical Institute.  Results of this symposium are expected to provide guidance  to the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in planning  support of further research on applications of ionizing  radiation in processing of contaminated and infected  liquids, solids and gases to reduce their pollutional  impacts on land, water and air.",
