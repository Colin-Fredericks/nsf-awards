 "awd_abstract_narration": "Barbara Wyslouzil is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental studies of binary   nucleation along thermodynamically unfavored paths.  The   thermodynamically favored path for nucleation crosses the free energy   surface through the saddle region with the lowest free energy.  However,   the combined effect of the monomer impingement rates and the shape of the   free energy surface can drive the flux over a ridge in a miscible binary   system.  The flux can also be driven through the saddle with the higher   free energy in a partially miscible system.  In both cases, the   analytical theories based on a saddle crossing will not predict the   correct nucleation rate behavior.  The proposed work has two goals: 1) to   identify real chemical systems and conditions where binary nucleation   proceeds primarily along a thermodynamically unfavored path; and 2) to   design and conduct experiments that clearly demonstrate binary nucleation   can occur in this manner.  The experimental part of this project will use   a two pulse expansion cloud chamber to conduct nucleation rate   measurements.  Careful modeling of particle formation processes in the   chamber, together with knowledge of the composition of the critical   nucleus, should make it possible to distinguish whether nucleation has   followed the thermodynamically favored path.  The deliberate enhancement or suppression of the formation of a   thermodynamically favored phase is important in many fields of   engineering.  In material science for example, processes which produce   submicron ceramic particles by vapor phase nucleation from a volatile   precursor can lead to materials with lower sintering temperatures over   conventionally produced ceramic powders.  In the chemical processing   industry the rates of nucleation, growth and recrystallization affect the   purity, quality, and sales value of bulk products such as common as sugar   and salt as well as specialty products such as zeolites.  In metallurgy,   different and potentially useful forms of metals may be produced if large   undercoolings are achieved without nucleation of a crystal phase.  A   better molecular level understanding of the nucleation could have a   potentially large impact on chemical processing in a large number of   manufacturing areas.",
