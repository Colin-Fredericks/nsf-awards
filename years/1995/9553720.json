 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) will  conduct a project using the Life Technologies, Inc.(LTI):  GIBCO  BRL Training Center laboratories in Germantown, Maryland.  Two-year  college faculty in partnership with high school teachers from  across the nation will be updated on cutting-edge biotechnological  research and procedures.  Teamed with scientists and technicians  from industry, these teachers will develop an innovative  educational model to rapidly adapt the advanced techniques and  sophisticated equipment of modem biotechnology to inexpensive,  hands-on, investigative classroom activities.  These activities  will allow two-year college and secondary schools with limited  budgets to provide future technicians and scientists with an  excellent scientific background in the techniques and concepts of  biotechnology.  Additionally, a strong articulation between  two-year and high school programs and industry will be established  to ensure that students pursuing careers in biotechnology have the  ability to enter the industrial or research work environment, as  more than competent technicians, or to pursue higher degrees at  four-year institutions.  These activities will seek to involve all  students in learning biotechnology, including women, minorities,  and persons with disabilities.  Emphasis will be placed on the role  of biotechnology in the future of the human environment and  medicine and the effect of biotechnology on preservation of plant  species and enrichment of agriculture.       Activities from this workshop will be refined, reviewed for  scientific accuracy and pedagogy, and field-tested nationwide.   Field test and review panel input will be used to modify the  activities for compilation into a monograph for nationwide  distribution.  Project results will be disseminated through  training and in-service workshops at national, state, regional, and  local levels.",
