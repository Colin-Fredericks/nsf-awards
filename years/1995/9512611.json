 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent technical advances have transformed the optical microscope from  an information gathering tool into an interactive analytical instrument  capable of detecting, manipulating, quantifying and sorting  subcellular, cellular and tissue specific properties. This application  requests funds for the purchase of an Ultima 312TM Premium Laser  Confocal Microscopic workstation (manufactured by Meridian Instruments,  Inc.) with enhanced interactive software for data acquisition, storage,  and off-line data acquisition. This confocal system was selected  because its unique and comprehensive confocal abilities with multiple  laser lines and applications software will accommodate the diverse  needs of the researchers at the University of Louisville. To maximize  user time, the system includes components that permit remote (off-line)  data analysis and 3-D reconstruction while the microscope is in use.  Among the tasks to be performed are:      to obtain highly-purified primary embryonic cell populations;    to study Ca2+ metabolism and intracellular pH after electrical and    chemical stimulation;    to examine co-localization of tRNA biosynthetic enzymes;    to perform high resolution in situ hybridization studies;     to determine the distribution of membranous components (i.e.     receptors, complex carbohydrates) and their relationships to     cytoskeletal organelles during a variety of dynamic cellular     phenomenon including phagocytosis and neuritogenesis; and     to obtain 3-D reconstructions for cytoarchitectural and developmental     morphometric comparisons.    The 16 research paradigms of the 32 faculty members in this application  are not inclusive of all projects that would utilize the Ultima, but  are intended to demonstrate the breadth of our needs. The instrument  will be housed in the Core Analytical Microscopy Laboratory (CAML)  which has served as the sole microscopy laboratory for all campuses of  the University for the past four years. Being the first confocal  microscopy system  in the CAML, it would enhance significantly our  optical microscopic capabilities, thereby providing for cuttingedge  technology for research and the training of CAML users, graduate  students and postdoctoral fellows. The research and outreach mission of  our \"Developmental and Molecular Neurobiology Program\" funded by an NSF  KY/EPSCoR contract will be greatly facilitated by this instrumentation.  Furthermore, recent faculty recruitment in the biological sciences has  been hampered by the lack of a confocal microscope. Therefore, in  addition to facilitating research and training of investigators and  students at U of L, the acquisition of the Ultima  should assist future  faculty recruitment in several departments and thus facilitate the  strategic plan of the University to become a research institution. The  genuine widespread need for this equipment is mirrored by the fact that  more than 50% of the funds needed to purchase the confocal scanning  laser microscopic workstation have been raised from the office of the  University Vice President for Research, Dean of the Medical School, and  10 different departments in several schools as well as individual  users.",
