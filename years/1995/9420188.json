 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes an international collaborative effort by systematists focusing  on the unstudied, undetermined holdings of Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, mantids,  roaches walking sticks and related insects) and Diptera (flies) at The Academy of Natural Sciences of  Philadelphia.  ANSP holds the largest collection of Orthoptera in the world, comprising more than a  million specimens from all regions, over 4000 primary types, and an associated collection of insect  songs and library of published research.  The use of the collection by scientists worldwide through  collection visits and loans of specimens confirms it as a worldwide, scientific resource.  It is the  only collection in North Amer ica to have supported active research on systematics of Orthoptera by a  continuum of curators for most of this century.  The Diptera collection (flies) contains impressive  collections in aquatic fly groups, such as the Chironomidae (aquatic midges), Ephydridae (shore flies)  and Tipulidae (crane flies) assembled through active research by curators for well over fifty years.  Both collections continue active development through strategic collecting and collection-based  research by resident curators and other scientific researchers.  Large numbers of specimens (estimated  in excess of 170,000) in both collections remain unstudied taxonmically even some years after specimen  preparation.  In many cases, these insects cannot be recollected due to subsequent habitat  destruction, logistical difficulties and other factors, and, in effect, the data carried by these  specimens are now unavailable to science and society.  These specimens are unidentified to taxonomic  levels that would allow retrieval to fulfill loan requests for further scientific study and fall  outside the specific taxonomic expertise represented by the resident curators. In addition, many of  the scientists potentially interested in studying these insects work overseas and find it difficult to  visit the collections.  The specimens themselves are too fragile, bulky and numerous to efficiently  ship to researchers in the numbers needed to allow taxonomic sorting by specialists and subsequent  inclusion in research.  This project represents the first such focused effort at reducing the number  of undetermined specimens for any Orthoptera collection.  Support will catalyze the process by  facilitation short-term intensively-focused visits by national and international specialists to sort  the undetermined backlog of specimens in their area of expertise to taxonomic levels (generally genus)  useful for loan retrieval and study.  These visiting curators will also provide valuable advice toward  upgrading the classification of the collection in their area  of expertise, and in directing us to  scientists whose studies might benefit from these newly sorted specimens.  These efforts will result  in an increase in loans and study of the collection materials for Orthoptera and Diptera, and a  reduction of the undetermined specimens to minimal, manageable amounts.  In particular, the newly  sorted specimens will not only supplement existing research projects, but their availability should  provide the impetus for initiation of new lines of research.  Additional components of this project  focus on readying the specimens in anticipation of the visiting curators and organization and  upgrading of the collection curation following their work.  This project will complete the rehousing  of all specimens of Orthoptera and Diptera from substandard units or vials to safe modern storage.  Unprepared specimens in both orders, representing the first collections for these orders in geographic  region or life stage, will be prepared and sorted taxonomically.  Recuration, including an update of  classification, will follow visits of specialists in both orders.  The Orthoptera Species File, a  computerized taxonomic authority file developed at ANSP, will be used for the first time in any  Orthoptera collection to verify and update scientific names, allowing staff and other collection users  to work more efficiently and accurately, and serving as a model project for curation of other  Orthoptera collections.  All completed aspects of this project will be publicized through targeted  letters, newsletters, electronic listing services and scientific meetings to reach a wide variety of  collection users.",
