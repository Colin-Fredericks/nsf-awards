Because many new researchers are isolated  from the statistical community, with little or no contact with junior and  senior colleagues in their field, this meeting provides a unique opportunity for new researchers to exchange ideas and initiate contact with one another. We hope that this conference will assist in the professional development of  new researchers, by helping them become full participants in the statistical  profession, and by providing an opportunity for them to act as peer mentors  for each other as they begin their scientific careers.  The ultimate effect of this process is a strengthening of the research base of the statistical  community in North America.   All those attending the conference are expected to actively participate by presenting their current research---either in a talk or displayed in a poster. There will be no parallel sessions. The program also includes several talks by senior statisticians and probabilists actively  involved in the most up-to-date areas of research. These people will be  invited to share their research ideas and enthusiasm for research, and to  provide tactical suggestions on how to build a thriving research program and  succeed in the academic world and larger statistical community.",
