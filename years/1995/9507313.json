 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to evolve generic initial  data for cosmological models to determine its asymptotic  behavior.  So far, this method has been successfully applied  to the plane symmetric (vacuum) Gowdy cosmology on the 3-  torus where strong support for its conjectured velocity  dominated singularity has been obtained and interesting  nonlinear interactions between the two polarizations of  gravitational waves in the model have been observed.    Cosmological observations indicate that, on the largest  distance scales, the dynamics of the Universe today can be  described by Einstein's theory of general relativity.  It  has long been known that, followed backward in time,  Einstein's equations imply that a singular state of infinite  density and temperature (the Big Bang) occurred a finite  time ago.  However, the nature of this predicted generic  singularity is not known.  The primary focus of this  research is a long term numerical study to determine the  nature of the generic cosmological singularity.",
