 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523128  Lesieutre         New captive sensors can measure distributions of  conductivity and permittivity in dielectrics.  Each sensor has a  set of interdigitated electrodes which impose a spatially  periodic source of voltage at temporal frequency f and spatial  wavelength.  With an excitation that is periodic in space, the  fields decay in the perpendicular direction with a penetration  depth equal to the spatial wavelength.  One set of electrodes are  driven with a variable frequency AC voltage, and a high impedance  measurement is made of the induced voltage on the alternate set  of floating electrodes.  The magnitude and phase of the floating  voltage depends on the dielectric permittivity and electrical  conductivity of the medium adjacent to the sensor.  From such  gain/phase measurements as a function of frequency for different  wavelength sensors, computer algorithms can calculate spatial  profiles of the permittivity and conductivity.  With calibration  of permittivity and conductivity dependence on other physical  variables such as moisture, temperature, concentration of  combustible gas, concentration of trace impurities, etc., it is  impossible to measure spatial distributions of such physical  quantities as a function of time.       Recent EPRI funded research has performed the preliminary  calibration between moisture and temperature to conductivity and  permittivity so that the sensors can be used to monitor the time  and space dynamics of moisture in oil impregnated transformer  pressboard.  The proposed research is to develop efficient  computer algorithms that can extract the pressboard moisture as a  function of time and space in transformers so that this  monitoring system of trend analysis and advanced diagnostics  sponsored by EPRI and several electric utilities.  Other research  tasks propose to extend the capability of the dielectrometry  sensor to include the investigation of special encapsulating  coatings that are selectively absorbing or reactive to  combustible ga s and other trace impurities in transformers such  as anti-oxidants, proposed anti-static additives such as  benzontriazole (BZA), and other impurities resulting from aging  and corrosion.  ***",
