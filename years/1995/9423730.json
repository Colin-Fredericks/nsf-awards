 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    This award supports a project to study the late  Pleistoceneglacial geology of the regions bordering the Bering  Strait.  Field work and laboratory analyses of fossil materials  collected on Chukotka Peninsula over the last three years  indicates that the late Cenozoic stratigraphic framework for NE  Russia is in need of significant revision.  This work casts doubt  on the number of glacial events recorded in the coastal  stratigraphy and undermines the correlation by Russian workers of  disjunct interglacial marine sequences that has been based on  biostratigraphy and elevation above sea level.  The development  of a unified stratigraphic scheme for those parts of Beringia on  both sides of the Bering Strait requires that the Pleistocene  stratigraphy of NE Russia be more firmly based upon modern  concepts of glacial sedimentology, isostasy, and eustasy and  secured with better geochronology.  Knowledge of glacial ice  extent in the Russian Arctic is important for establishing  accurate boundary conditions for paleoclimatic modeling.  Likewise, knowledge of interglacial marine conditions in the  region is important for understanding changes in the distribution  of watermasses and heat transport as well as understanding the  role of the Bering Strait in global ocean circulation models.    Based upon past field work and a complete inventory of moraines  and other glaciogenic deposits using European Space Agency  synthetic-aperture-radar images across NE Russia, this project  will revise the Late Cenozoic stratigraphy of the region and  provide an opportunity for both US and Russian researchers to  compare and exchange field methods and laboratory techniques via  joint study of crucial stratigraphic sections and moraine  sequences on both sides of the Bering Strait.   Special attention  will be given to the paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic  significance of similarities and contrasts in the Pleistocene  records.  The correlation and geochronology of the deposits will  be based upon  a variety of modern techniques, including amino  acid geochronology of mollusks, soft sediment paleomagnetism,  cosmogenic isotope surface exposure dating and quantitative  geomorphology of moraines, along with traditional  biostratigraphy.  The results of this project will be important  to developing a complete picture of paleoenvironmental conditions  in this region.    Beyond the scientific work described here there are ancillary  benefits to this US-Russian cooperative venture.  Collaboration  and joint field work between U.S. and Russian Quaternary  researchers active in areas of Beringia is beneficial due to the  shared earth and cultural history of our common border.  The  proposed development in the Bering Strait region of a jointly  managed Beringian Heritage Park by the National Park Service and  Russian counterparts highlights this shared legacy.  Shared  problem-solving in the field is necessary due to national  differences in sedimentologic and stratigraphic terminology and  concepts.  An important benefit will be the opportunity to expose  our Russian colleagues to geochronological techniques not  presently  available in their country.",
