 "awd_abstract_narration": "9552499  Wright    Two consortia, the International Telecomputing Consortium (ITC) and  Organizations Concerned about Rural Education (OCRE), propose to  join forces to:  *    Stimulate and assist policy makers and leaders of rural school  communities to consider and resolve problems involved in providing  their communities with practical, active, and productive access to  the National Information Infrastructure (NII); and   *    Present those policy makers with direct familiarity wit  effective models of rural community access to the NII and with  comprehensive information about the operation and effectiveness of  such models, particularly those developed or applied in projects  supported by the Networking Infrastructure for Education (NIE) and  the Rural Systemic Initiative (RSI) programs of the National  Science Foundation (NSF);   *    Provide telecommunications access and support to a user  community open to inclusion of NSF/NIE grantees, others nominated  by NSF/NIE and OCRE/ITC constituents.  In this common endeavor, OCRE and ITC will review proposals and  accomplishments of projects sponsored by NSF that offer improved  access to telecommunications resources for policy makers,  administrators, teachers and leaders of rural school communities.  In addition to conference discussions, telecommunications access to  this project's file server will inform local leaders about what has  been tried and what has been accomplished by NSF projects. They  will benefit from experience-based knowledge of working strategies  for accessing the NII and using telecommunications technologies in  rural communities.       The two organizations will work to advance NII access for  rural schools in four ways:  1.   In consultation with NSF/NIE program managers, they will  examine NSF proposals and reports from active projects to describe  a range of concepts about rural infrastructure that hold  promise  for rural school communities.  For example, they will look at  alternative methods of access (e.g. via power  companies, microwave)  and community cost-share.   2.   They will conduct panel reviews and discussions focused on  project experiences to learn about strategies used to build a  sustainable infrastructure for NII access.  A national panel of  OCRE members will a) participate in review of selected NSF\\NIE and  RSI proposals and reports and b) develop agenda for (and  participate in) rural focus groups convened at national meetings of  the Rural education association, other OCRE member groups (e.g.  the National School Board Association, school administrators  associations, the Triangle Coalition) and the technology conference  of the National Education Association.              3.   With OCRE collaboration, ITC will develop and operate a  telecommunications file server to provide project participants  (e.g. rural leaders, NSF/NIE and RSI grantees) with:  *    Internet mailing lists on priority topics (e.g. rural access  to the NII);  *    Gopher and WOrld-Wide Web access to reports  on rural  education policy issues;   *    Interactive referral to relevant information databases (e.g.  the Rural Datafication project of CICNet, Web sites that provide  PUC rulings or universal service options).  4.   A summary project report will help rural communities and  boards of education make policy decisions about local access to the  NII and other telecommunications.  This report will, itself, be  designed for telecommunications applications.  ***",
