 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  aim  of  the  proposed  research is to study how  autonomous  agents  can  adapt to dynamic  partially known task environments.  Potential applications of such agents range from hardware  robots  that  automate delivery chores to software programs that retrieve  information from the  Internet.  This research will focus  on  an  adaptive  control   paradigm called reinforcement  learning.   In  this  approach,  agents  acquire task skills  through  trial  and  error    by   selecting   actions    that   maximize   a   reward  function.Reinforcement learning has some  problems.  It converges  extremely slowly, especially in large  state space problems where  rewards  occur  infrequently. Also, the  learned skills  transfer  poorly  across  related tasks.  This  research  will  investigate  using  a  novel  modular  task  architecture  to  overcome  these  limitations of reinforcement learning. The  proposed architecture  decomposes composite multiple goal tasks into primitive  subtasks  that  achieve  each individual goal.  It utilizes  training  time  more   efficiently  by  dynamically  switching  between  learning  different  tasks  based on their difficulty and  importance.   It  increases transfer across tasks by reusing  solutions learned  to  primitive  subtasks  using a weighted linear  sum  function.   It  solves recurrent tasks more effectively by  using a reinforcement  learning  method  that  optimizes average   reward.   A  detailed  experimental  study  of  the  proposed   architecture   will   be  undertaken, using a variety of simulated and real robot testbeds.",
