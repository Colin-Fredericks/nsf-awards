 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project adds a crucial laboratory component to two classes  taught by Department of Computer Science:  Operating Systems and  Networking and Data Communications.   These two courses have a  common need for experimentation-based, laboratory experience.   The  new laboratory has six workstations of various configurations plus  a file server.   This lab exists on its own subnet, isolated from  the general purpose lab while retaining access to its printers and  other services.   It is configured so that each machine has two  disks.   The second disk on each machine is provided for  experimentation--it can be manipulated and even trashed without  damaging the laboratory setup or the general purpose lab.   The  system is as diverse as possible, with machines from four different  classes of workstation.   Each class is configured differently, has  different requirements, and is used for different purposes.   The  networking media are different and varied.   Work is being done to  support the automation of machine reinstallation.   Students are  responsible for machine reinstallation.  This project constructs a  laboratory environment to teach Operating Systems and Networking,  produces a set of laboratory manuals for each of these  classes--both in electronic hypertext and hardcopy forms--and  produces a set of new software, developed to facilitate the  laboratory experiments.",
