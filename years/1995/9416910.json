 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416910  Halperin  Research will focus on a range of theoretical problems in the field  of condensed matter and statistical physics.  Long-range goals are  to improve the basic understanding of strongly interacting many-  body systems and highly disordered materials, to develop new  theoretical and computational techniques, and to explain  outstanding experimental puzzles.  A major concern will be  properties of quasi-two-dimensional electron systems at low  temperatures, in very strong magnetic fields.  Research will  concentrate on Landau-level filling fractions where the quantised  Hall effect is not observed.  Theoretical analysis will be based on  a mathematical transformation where the electrons become a set of  fermions that interact through a fictitous electric and magnetic  field of the Chern-Simons type.  Topics to be studied include  finite temperature transport experiments, as well as fundamental  limits to the applicability of the fermion Chern-Simons theory.   Another major concern will be low-temperature properties of spin  systems where quantum mechanical fluctuations are very important.   One focus will be properties of materials such as high temperature  superconductors which contain quasi-one-dimensional spin-one spin  chains with antiferromagnetic interactions.  Other work will  explore higher dimensional spin systems with frustrated  interactions.  Other research will include properties of disordered  systems, especially nuclear magnetic resonance studies of water in  porous media such as rocks.  The focus here will be the analysis of  the effects of the diffusion of water molecules on nuclear magnetic  resonance signals obtained using various pulse sequences in complex  geometries.  %%%  Research will focus on a range of theoretical problems in the field  of condensed matter and statistical physics.  A major concern will  be properties at low temperatures, in very strong magnetic fields  of quasi-two-dimensional electron layers, which occur in various  semiconductor devices  such as the field-effect transistor.  The  research also has implications for other materials such as high-  temperature superconductors.

This  work may have application to oil recovery.",
