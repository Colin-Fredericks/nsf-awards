 "awd_abstract_narration": "94-23305  Marcus  Prof. Marcus will model numerically the east-west winds in the  upper troposphere (i.e., the visible cloud layer) of Jupiter and  Saturn, using 3-D fluid-dynamics.  The principal objective is to  improve our understanding of why the winds are structured in zones  or bands with alternating velocity directions from the equator to  the poles.  Additionally, the Principal Investigator (PI) will  address other unresolved issues of those giant planets' atmospheres  -- the number of bands, the magnitude of the wind velocities, the  greater velocities of the Saturnian winds compared to the Jovian  winds, and the relationship between the winds and the vortices  embedded in them.    The motivation for the work is that, unlike thermal convection in  stars which can be reproduced and studied under laboratory  conditions (albeit in simplified form), the mechanism of \"east-  west\" winds of planetary atmospheres has not been modeled in the  laboratory and all proposed methods for creating such winds remain  mere conjectures.  Yet we cannot claim to understand the outer  planets until we understand their east-west winds.    The PI will base his calculations on two different sets of  assumptions: (1) The winds' vertical depth extends over tens of to  several hundred density scale heights; and (2) the winds are  confined to a thin vertical layer.  The point is to decide between  the two kinds of theories.  The calculations will be done in both  spherical and parabolic geometries.  The latter geometry has the  advantage that a parabolic dish containing a stable fluid overlying  a convecting fluid can be built in a laboratory to test the  validity of the numerical results, an experiment the PI is  suggesting to be carried out by others.",
