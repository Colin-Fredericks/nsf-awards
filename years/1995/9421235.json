 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421235         The major objective of this project is to test, by means of  a cross-cultural comparison, a proposed pathway for how young  children achieve the basic skills required for generating  sustained cooperative action with others (e.g., games,  conversations, working together on a common task). The proposed  pathway, based on prior work with children developing within  contemporary USA culture, will be tested through study of  children developing within Seltaman culture, a recently tribal  people of Papua New Guinea. Three features of this pathway are  expected to be conserved despite such a major change in the  cultural context for human development--the emergence of a new  readiness to imitate others' nonverbal actions around two years  of age (the imitative pattern), the role of the imitative pattern  in generating sustained bouts of nonverbal cooperative action  before children have sufficient verbal skills to generate  cooperative action, and the role of these bouts of nonverbal  cooperative action in facilitating children's development of  verbal means for facilitating cooperative action. To test these  expectations, Seltaman children between 1 and 5 years of age will  be videotaped weekly across a six-month period as they interact  with other children in the normally-occurring activities of their  village. The developmental course of nonverbal imitative acts,  the extent to which nonverbal imitative acts account for all  instances of cooperative acts, the use of imitative acts in  generating sustained bouts of cooperative activity, and the  selective occurrence of verbal means of facilitating cooperative  action within sustained bouts of nonverbal cooperative action  will be assessed through analysis of the resulting videotapes and  the transcriptions provided by villagers. These findings will be  integrated with those resulting from a broader-scope companion  project of young Seltaman children's social relationships to  assess the reasons for any commonalities and differences t hat  exist between USA and Seltaman culture in the developmental  pathway toward the mastery of cooperative action.    This project employs a cross-cultural comparison to test a  proposed developmental pathway for how young children achieve the  basic skills required for generating sustained cooperative action  with others (e.g, games, conversations, working together on a co  task). The proposed pathway, based on prior work with young  children developing within contemporary USA culture, will be  tested through the study of children developing within Seltaman  culture, a recently tribal people of Papua New Guinea. Because  the Seltaman culture differs from U.S. culture on a number of  dimensions that might influence the emergence of early  cooparative interactions, these data qwill provide a significant  step toward testing the universality of the devleopmental pathway  documented in past research. Three features of this pathway are  expected to be conserved despite such a drastic change in the  cultural context for development: (1) the emergence around two  years of age of a new readiness to imitate others' nonverbal  actions (the imitative pattern); (2) the role of the imitative  pattern in enabling young children to first generate a wide  variety of new patterns of sustained cooperative action, before  they have the verbal means to do so, and (3) the role of these  sustained bouts of nonverbal cooperative actions in facilitating  the child's development of verbal means of achieving cooperative  action.  This cross-cultural comparison addresses both key  theoretical issues (e.g., how conservatism and variability  coexist in paths of human development) and important practical  issues (e.g., revealing how to provide experiences that  facilitate young children's cooperation; filling the need for  cross-culturally validated answers to developmental questions  pressing upon educators and child care providers who work with  groups of children that are increasingly culturally diverse.)",
