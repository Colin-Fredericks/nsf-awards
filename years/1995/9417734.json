 "awd_abstract_narration": "We  request funding for graphics workstations and high speed networking  equipment  to  be  installed in the Biological  Sciences  and  Computer  Sciences  Departments at Purdue University. This equipment is necessary  for   the   determination   of   crystal   structures   of   biological  macromolecular  assemblies  with a high level  of  non-crystallographic  symmetry  using the parallel computers. Such computationally  intensive  studies  require  the  development of  parallel  programs  and  problem  solving environments which facilitate access to parallel computers.        Most  of  our  work  has  focused so far on  the  analyses  of  virus  structures at atomic resolution. This work will be expanded to  examine  all kinds of biological structures such as proteins and protein nucleic  acid  complexes. Until now, our program development efforts  have  been  concentrated  on  electron density averaging and modification,  and  on  Fourier syntheses and analyses. Attention will now be directed to  data  processing  by  parallelizing programs originally developed  at  Purdue  University.  It  is  hoped  that  these  programs,  among   the   first  crystallographic  parallel  program developments,  will  become  widely  adopted. The current interface, permitting easy access to the suite  of  structural biology programs is to be improved and the range of tasks of  the programs, is to be extended.        It  has  already  been  shown that parallel  computing  has  made  it  possible to perform tasks that were previously out of reasonable range.  Thus the availability of these programs has been an essential component  in   the   solution   of  a  variety  of  difficult   virus   structure  determinations  e.g.,  the  human Coxsakie  virus  B3  and  the  insect  Nodamura  viruses. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that  these  developments  will  have  a  major  impact  in  the  study  of  complex  biological  molecules that perform basic and essential life  processes,  and  on  the study of  viruses whose processes might be halted  given  a  better knowledge of structure.        In  response  to the computing needs of our group, Purdue  University  acquired a 140 compute node Paragon system in May 1994 and is providing  $200,000 in cost sharing for this proposal.",
