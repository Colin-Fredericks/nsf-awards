 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although data flow analysis was first developed for use in  compilers, its usefulness is now recognized in many software  engineering tools.  Because of the origin of global data flow  analysis, that is, compilers, the  computation of data flow for  software tools is based on the traditional data  flow framework.  However, this framework for computing data flow is not  producing  the efficiency, the preciseness, or the type of data flow problem  needed for software tools. These problems are due to the  requirements of  exhaustive data flow that information is  computed for all possible executions,  at all points, and all  information is computed at each program point.    This  work investigates the definition of data flow problems  when the properties of  all executions, all program points  and all information at each program  point of exhaustive data  flow are relaxed, producing partial data flow  information  computed on demand. The goal is to define a formal framework, in  the vein of the traditional framework, where partial data flow  problems can be  defined and computed. Because the number  of problems will grow with partial  data flow, and the data flow  problems will not be known in many cases until run  time, this  project investigates the implementation of partial data flow  analysis by defining a specification technique to express the  demand driven  problem and automatically generating the algorithm  that computes the  information.  In order to define partial data  flow, information has to be  provided that reduces the scope of  data flow analysis.  This information can  either be static  information, provided before execution, or dynamic information  that is used to either further refine static data flow or to  drive its  computation.  This work first focuses on debugging and  testing tools and then  explores other applications in software  engineering.",
