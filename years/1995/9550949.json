This goal meshes well with the pedagogical  method supported by the entire science division of requiring a  strong research component as part of the curriculum.  In addition  to experiments for the sophomore-level physics laboratory, two  experiments are proposed which would be part of a Junior/Senior  Research Program, in which students work one-on-one on research  projects with a professor.  The program presented has been  carefully designed for a small department with limited resources.          There are several reasons for selecting particle physics  experiments for this program.  Particle physics is one of the  frontier areas of modern physics research, yet experiments of this  type are not usually part of the undergraduate laboratory  curriculum.  These experiments offer one of the few opportunities  students have for observing first-hand the effects of relativity.   By providing students with practical and up-to-date experience  using modern, fast electronic and computerized data acquisition and  analysis, we hope to give them the skills and knowledge necessary  to succeed in a career in any branch of experimental physics.",
