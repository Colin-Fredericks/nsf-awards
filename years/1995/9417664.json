The virus examined is the squash leaf curl virus (SqLCV)  which, unlike most plant viruses, has a DNA genome.  Two  proteins encoded by the viral DNA, BR1 and BL1, are  important for the cell-tocell movement of the virus  during infection. BR1 is predominantly found in the  nucleus and BL1 is found predominantly at the cell  wall/plasma membrane.  Lazarowitz has proposed a model in  which BL1 and BR1 act in concert to direct the short  distance cell-to-cell movement of the viral genome, and  BR1 promotes viral long distance movement in the phloem.  This model predicts that BL1 increases the size exclusion  limit of plasmodesmata in the cell wall to facilitate  viral gemone movement to adjacent uninfected phloem  cells.  It further predicts that BR1 is a nuclear shuttle  protein that binds viral ssDNA and moves it to the cell  periphery. At the cell periphery the complex interacts  with BL1 which allows it to move locally to adjacent  uninfected cells and sieve elements which provide long  distance transport through the phloem.  The model is  tested by 1) using direct assays and tissue-specific  promoters to demonstrate that BL1 and BR1 function in  cell-to-cell and systemic movement, host range and tissue  specificity, 2) localizing BL1 and BR1 in infected and  transgenic plants to specific tissues and subcellular  compartments and determining their effects on plasmodemal  size-exclusion limit, 3) characterizing the biochemical  properties of BL1 and BR1, and their interactions that  lead to transport of viral nucleic acids, and  4)  identifying and purifying host proteins interacting with  BL1, and cloning and characterizing the genes encoding  these proteins.  In the latter situation, it is expected  that the proteins involved in viral transport wil l be the  same as those normally involved in cell-to-cell  communication and in the regulation of phloem transport.  %%%  The aim of the research is to understand the cellular  interactions that occur between a plant virus and its  host that define the permissive host range of the virus  and which lead to the development of  systemic infection.  The virus examined is the squash leaf curl virus (SqLCV)  which, unlike most plant viruses, has a DNA genome.  Two  proteins encoded by the viral DNA, BR1 and BL1, are  important for the cell-tocell movement of the virus  during infection. BR1 is predominantly found in the  nucleus and BL1 is found predominantly at the cell  wall/plasma membrane. The studies test the model that BR1  acts as a shuttle to bring the DNA to the plasma membrane  from the nucleus.  Once at the plasma membrane, the model  predicts that BR1 works in concert with BL1 to allow  viral component transport through the connections between  plant cells, the plasmodesmata. Microscopy studies will  define the tissue and subcellular location of BR1 and BL1  in infected and transgenic plants. Microinjection studies  will directly examine the effects of each protein on the  cell-to-cell movement of  the BR1-DNA complexes and non-  specific molecules of graded size. Studies in tissue  culture model systems will define the domains of BR1 and  BL1 required for their correct targeting  to the plasma membrane or nucleus and for direct  interaction with each other.  The studies are ultimately  directed at identifying the host cell proteins that  interact with BL1.  The studies show whether different  mechanisms are used for virus short or long distance  movment, and if phloemrestricted viruses move by a  different mechanism from other viruses.  Understanding  the mechanism underlying these phenenomena is required in  order to develop strategies for engineering virus-  resistant plants.  ***",
