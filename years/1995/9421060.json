 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421060  Chen         In this project, the synoptic-scale, mesoscale and local  processes favorable for the development of heavy precipitation  during TAMEX will be studied based on the results form numerical  models and the data collected during the Taiwan Area Mesoscale  Experiment (TAMEX).  As the Mei-Yu front approached the island of  Taiwan, the prefrontal southwest monsoon flow (or the low-level  jet) brought in the warm, moist unstable air from the south.  In  addition to the low-level lifting (orographic and frontal), the  presence of upper-level forcings (the upper-level divergence  related to diffluent airflow or the frontogenetical forcing  associated with a jet-front system) is required for the development  of widespread rainstorms in the subtropics.  In this study, we will  diagnose a LLJ based on the model generated high resolution data.   In particular, the link between the cyclongenesis and the  development of LLJ will be further investigated.  In addition, we  will study the coupling between the upper-level and low-level  circulations leading to the development of widespread  precipitation.         The synoptic-scale circulations regulate whether or not  widespread precipitation will occur, whereas mesoscale  circulations, local circulations and orographic effects govern the  details of precisely when and where the convection will occur.  We  will study the prefrontal mesoscale airflow over the Taiwan area  based on radar, aircraft and conventional data as well as a nested  grid model.  In particular, we will focus on the airflow on the  windward side as the upper-level trough/low-level jet approached.   In the prefrontal southwesterly flow, the deflected southerly jet  along the coast and results in a localized convergence zone  favorable for the development of deep convection.  As the front  moved over the northern Taiwan, the deflected southerly flow may  merge with the undeflected southwesterly flow in the Taiwan Strait  off the northwestern coast and results in a localized  convergence  zone favorable for the development of deep convection.  As the  front moved over the northern Taiwan, the deflected southerly flow  may converge with the postfrontal northeasterlies and results in an  enhanced frontal convergence zone along the coast.  To assess the  effects of thermally driven circulations caused by the diurnal  heating cycle  on precipitation, we will study the rainfall  characteristics during  the diurnal cycle at different parts of the  island.  In addition, we will conduct a case study of local  circulations over the island under the prefrontal southwest monsoon  flow based on the data collected during IOP #11.",
