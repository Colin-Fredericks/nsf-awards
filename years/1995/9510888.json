 "awd_abstract_narration": "A recent trend in generative syntax has been the development  of a minimalist program. This minimalism shows up in two distinct  ways. First, derivations and representations conform to an  'economy' criterion demanding that they be minimal; no extra  steps in derivations and no extra symbols in representations are  allowed. Second, the theory itself is developing in the direction  of minimality. Thus, in place of a variety of distinct earlier  transformations we have Affect a; conditions on transformations  and representations avoid redundancy by not overlapping in their  effects, etc. Chomsky (1993) has recently suggested carrying this  minimalist program still further with a proposal that a syntactic  representation consists not of the familiar four levels,  D-structure, S-structure, Phonetic Form, and Logical Form, but  rather, only the latter two - the apparently irreducible  'interface levels', which provide instructions for the  articulatory-perceptual and conceptual-intentional performance  systems. Since virtually every module of the theory appears to  display strong S-structure effects, the success of the minimalist  program depends on the reduction of all such requirements to LF  and PF well-formedness conditions, and/or to general economy  considerations. The goal of this project is to explore the  possibility of such a reduction in Case theory and the form that  the resulting minimalist theory of Case might have. The emphasis  will be on two types of Case standardly treated as polar  opposites: 'inherent' Case, which has thematic import, and  'exceptional' Case, which by definition has no thematic import.  The possibility of unifying the two Case types will be explored.  Data from Serbo-Croatian, a language which due to its rich overt  Case-marking provides more accessible data pertaining to Case  theory than English, will be used in the investigation of  inherent Case. The conclusions reached during the investigation  are expected to have considerable theoretical importance, si nce  Case theory plays a central role in the grammar and crucially  interacts with a number of other modules.",
