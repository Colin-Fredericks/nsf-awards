This  inability can be overcome however, by permeabilizing the  nuclear membranes of these intact nuclei prior to incubating  them in the egg extract.  The long term objective of this  project is to determine the molecular basis for this loss of  replication capacity and to determine if this inability is  part of a \"molecular switch\" designed to promote passage of  the egg-phase cell out of the cell cycle and entry into a  quiescent state.  These studies will also provide insights  into the requirements for the initiation of replication upon  re-entry of the quiescent cell into the cell cycle.  The  loss of replication capacity upon growth arrest may be due  to: 1) the loss of a replication license; 2) the acquisition  of an inhibitor of replication and/or 3) changes in nuclear  membrane structure and function.  These possibilities will  be investigated by isolating nuclei from BALB/c 3T3 cells,  synchronized in various stages of the cell cycle, and by  determining their capacity for DNA replication in a cell-  free system derived from Xenopus eggs.  Initially, a novel  nuclear membrane permeabilization and repair strategy will  be used to determine whether or not exposure of permeable G0  nuclei to the soluble egg extract is required for DNA  replication.  These studies will also address whether  changes in nuclear membrane structure are in part,  responsible for the loss of replication capacity in  quiescent cell nuclei.  Egg extracts devoid of licensing  factor activity will be used to determine if G0 nuclei, like  G2 nuclei, lack a replication license.  Furthermore, this  permeabilization and repair strategy will also serve as an  assay for the identification of a licensing factor or other  essential replication factors present in egg extract but  missing from quiescent cell nuclei.  To determine if  qu iescent nuclei are prevented from replicating by growth  arrest specific inhibitor of replication, extracts from  quiescent cells will be used to determine whether they can  convert a replication competent G1 nucleus  into an  incompetent form.  Quiescent cell extracts can be assayed  for inhibitory factors using this approach.  The timing of,  and molecular basis for, the restoration of replication  competence during re-entry into the cell cycle will also be  investigated.  Extracts from competent cells will be assayed  for their ability to promote replication of G0 nuclei in egg  extract.  In this way, a mammalian replication licensing  activity may be identified.  The initiation of DNA  replication is one of the most crucial points of control of  the eukaryotic cell cycle; therefore, a more through  understanding of the regulation mechanisms operating at this  level is essential for a more complete understanding of  regulated cell growth and division.  %%%  This is a project which examines the regulation od the  \"quiescent\" state which occurs in eggs (African clawed frog  eggs) prior to fertilization. The cell cycle, which is  composed of periods which include mitosis (M Phase) and  synthesis of DNA (S phase) and the gaps of time in between  these phases (G1 and G2), can also be said to have a G0  phase which is the phase of inactive or quiescent cells.  The entry of active cells  into the quiescent state (G0)  occurs at G1, while reentry from G0 into G1 is followed by  initiation of replication of DNA (start of  S phase).  The  entry of active cells into the quiescent state can be  thought of as a loss of a replication license, since there  is evidence that eggs have a \"licensing factor\" which can  allow replication of DNA. The existence of licensing factor  is assayed by exposing nuclei isolated from mammalian cells  to egg extract in vitro.  Alternatives to the hypothesis  that there is a loss of  replication license include the  possibilities that there are inhibitors of replication  acti vity in the egg, or that there are changes in the  nuclear membrane structure which somehow block replication.  A novel nuclear membrane and repair strategy is used to  address the latter possibility.  The inhibitor hypothesis  will be tested by using quiescent egg extracts (not able to  replicate DNA) to induce arrest in active mammalian cell  nuclei (competent for DNA replication). If the approaches  are successful, the identification of the mammalian  licensing factor would be forthcoming.  These studies are  basic to an understanding of how growth and division is  regulated in animal cells.  ***",
