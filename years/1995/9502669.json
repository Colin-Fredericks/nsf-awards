 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to answer a set of critical questions dealing  with communication systems by way of the development and use of a  simulation and implementation modeling environment for virtual  circuit switches.  The first question concerns systematic,  standardized performance comparisons.  Using relevant traffic  models and trace data from actual applications, this study is  standardizing performance measurements, eliminating the apples-to-  oranges comparisons that result when considering performance  results from different research groups.  The second question  concerns cost and implementation modeling.  This work is  integrating the design of system architecture and implementation.   The particular focus is on electronic implementation and multichip  module packaging technology.  The third question concerns the role  of architecture in providing quality of service guarantees.  The  usual abstraction of the switch as a queue hides too much detail  about internal architecture that is relevant to traffic behavior  when traversing a switch.  This work is characterizing the effect  on traffic of different switch architectures, and developing switch  mechalisms to work in concert with other mechanisms in providing  quality of service guarantees.    The educational part of the project is using the simulation and  implementation modeling environment as a key component of a  graduate course in High Speed Switching Networks.  In addition,  portions of the research amp appear in two undergraduate courses,  one on VLSI Design and the other on Modeling.  Other education  efforts include significant mentoring activity and ongoing  improvement in teaching.",
