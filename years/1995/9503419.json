 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT   We study complex systems modeled by interacting  particles, or, more generally, by Markov Processes with a high  dimensional state space. In the presence of conservation laws,  the Markov Process will have several invariant measures. If the  interaction is local then the evolution will take the system  quickly to a local equilibrium  parametrized by the local  averages of the conserved quantities. These parameters that are  functions of space and time will evolve according to some  evolution law after suitable rescaling. There are  several  examples of this phenomenon, known as hydrodynamic scaling:  the  transition from Hamiltonian Equations for particles to Euler  Equations  for a fluid, Nonlinear diffusion equations for the  bulk diffusion of various interacting particle systems etc. The  project investigates rigorously this transition for several  classes of models.     One of the central problems in the use of  mathematical models in the physical as well as social sciences,  is the problem of scaling.  One has a complex system consisting  of a large number of interacting components which is evolving in  time. Its properties are specified at the level of individual  components. However one is interested in how certain small number  of measurements made on the large or global scale evolve in time.  The aim of this research is to make a  mathematically valid link  between the two in certain specific physical models.",
