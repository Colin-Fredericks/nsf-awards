 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calvetti       The investigator and her colleague undertake collaborative  studies of numerical methods for image processing.  The aim of the  project is to develop and analyze new fast algorithms for  computing an estimate of an original image from a degraded image  that has been subjected to noise and blur.  Depending on the point  of view, two philosophically different approaches to image  restoration result: i) in algebraic restoration one views the  problem as a linear, possibly ill-conditioned, system of  equations, and ii) in stochastic restoration one regards it as a  problem of estimating a vector under random disturbances.  The  project develops numerical methods for both approaches.  Either  approach yields linear systems of equations that have a structure  that can be used in the development and analysis of efficient  algorithms for image restoration.  The structure depends on the  assumptions made on the image and the noise.  The matrices in these  systems are typically quite large; orders of a million are common.  The computational work, even with efficient methods, is therefore  quite demanding.  Because many applications require real-time image  restoration, the development of algorithms for parallel computers  is important.  The proposed research focuses on the development of  iterative methods that lend themselves well to implementation on  multiprocessors.       The central problem of image restoration is the estimation of  the original image, given a version of the image degraded by noise  and blur.  When the image is of a star observed from earth, the  blur may be due to the atmosphere and the noise can stem from  transmission of the signal.  Several different approaches to image  restoration are available.  They all give rise to large systems of  equations; a million equations are common.  The system of equations  has a structure, which depends on the assumptions made on the  image and on the statistical properties of the noise.  The purpose  of the project is to develop ne w algorithms for the restoration of  images.  These algorithms are designed so that they use the  structure of the system of equations in order to reduce the  computational work.  They are moreover suitable for use on parallel  computers.  The latter is important due to the large amount of  computations required.",
