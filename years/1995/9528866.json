The topical focus areas are:   1) external aerodynamics,   2) under-hood cooling,   3) climate control flows, and   4) induction/exhaust system flows.    The specific objectives are delineating the:   1) basic research efforts which should be pursued to contribute to the pre- competitive knowledge base in each of the four topical areas, and   2) operating procedures which will permit useful interactions between academic r researchers and industrial colleagues.    A general objective of the workshop:  to bring together members of the industrial and the academic communities to explore common interests, will be met by its organizational structure.  Specifically, the designated co-chairs for the four breakout sessions will be selected from these two communities, and the general attendees will be invited from the two communities.  There are, built into the program, formal and informal opportunities to effect the contacts that can be expected to lead to appropriate cooperative efforts.    Joint support has been arranged from the Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors Corporation.  In addition, The Automotive Research Initiative of Michigan State University will contribute to the support of the workshop.",
