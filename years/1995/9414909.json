 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for the renovation and modernization of the Campuswide Electron Optics Facility (CEOF) at the Ohio State University.  As a part of the Center for Materials Research, the CEOF is an open facility consisting of equipment used for the characterization of materials at a variety of levels.  In an attempt to increase the capabilities for materials characterization, new transmission electron microscopes have been purchased, and equipment for scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction has been added to the facility.  Presently, equipment is located in a central location due to the poor condition of the physical infrastructure of the facility.  Although the natural surroundings are suitable for the instrumentation, there has been no provision made for sound absorption, climate control, and a dust-free environment.  In order to study the microstructural characteristics of advanced materials, it is imperative that  the detrimental effects that inhibit performance  of the equipment be corrected.   NSF funds will be used to support the following renovations:  replacement of ceiling and floor coverings, infusion of sound absorbing materials in the walls of  laboratories containing sensitive equipment, improvement of air conditioning systems within the research and research training areas, and the provision of a room designated for off-line analysis of data.  The renovations will permit the instrumentation to be operated at the highest level of performance, and provide for enhanced efficiency of use and research training.  Apart from the Ohio State community, the CEOF will be available as part of the Ohio Materials Network, in which scientists and students across the State of Ohio have guaranteed access to the equipment required to conduct research  in material science.",
