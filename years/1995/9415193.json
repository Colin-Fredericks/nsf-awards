 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whittingham       The NSF award will provide support for renovation of the Materials  Chemistry/Physics Facility in the Science II building at the State University of New  York (SUNY) Binghamton.  Science II was constructed in 1967 and has not  undergone any renovation since.  Project funding will provide a substantial  improvement for cross-disciplinary activities between chemistry and physics in the  areas of materials chemistry and condensed matter physics.  The effort will benefit 6  faculty members, 22 graduate students and approximately 14 undergraduate  researchers.         The NSF-funded project to renovate interior laboratories will complement  institutional efforts  for major mechanical and roofing improvements.  Laboratories  and instrumentation facilities are located on the ground floor of Science II, and  renovation activities will include consolidation and reorganization of space,  installation of fume hoods, addition of air conditioning units for individual  temperature control,  installation of a Helium liquefier, upgrades to the electrical  system, installation of a delivery system for gaseous nitrogen, and installation of new  laboratory casework.         The project will substantially improve research facilities for Electronics  Packaging and Materials Research which have been selected by the University as  areas of programmatic emphasis.  University identification of these priorities includes  resource investment in faculty recruitment, seed funding for development of two  organized research centers, and substantial start-up funds for conduct of research.***  Stevenson       The NSF and the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) will jointly support the  renovation of approximately 131 square research meters for the enhancement of  laboratory facilities in systematic and economic botany.  The impacted laboratories  have not been renovated since their original construction in 1957.  As a result, they  are not configured, or mechanically served, for molecular plant systematics, and t hey  do not meet modern health and safety standards.  Faculty and graduate students have  been unable to conduct on-site research and training and have had to travel to local  affiliated laboratories and, on occasion, to laboratories located out of state.         Renovations will include replacement of two antiquated fume hoods,  installation of new electrical wiring with ground fault receptacles, upgrading of water  delivery  and drainage systems, installation of thermostatic controls, replacement of  traps and valves on steam radiators, removal of unused steam lines, and refurbishment  of laboratory cabinets, floors, walls, ceilings, and lab bench tops.         The renovation of laboratories for use in molecular systematics will add new  impetus to the research and research training program at  NYBG and will directly  benefit five research scientists, three post doctoral students, and fifteen graduate  students in molecular biology.  The molecular research program allows researchers to  track the evolution of the same gene in species from widely different groups of  organisms, which in turn provides new insight on plant evolutionary history.  The  Garden is also used by visiting scientists, many of whom travel from Latin America  for study and has cooperative programs with three local universities.",
