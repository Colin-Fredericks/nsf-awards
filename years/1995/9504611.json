 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sacks       The investigator studies the one-dimensional inverse  scattering problem of quantum mechanics, in which the solution to  be found is a potential in the Schrodinger equation, and develops  effective numerical methods for computing the solution.  A variety  of inverse scattering problems are known to be uniquely solvable  when a complex valued function, known as the reflection  coefficient, is given as data.  In many interesting applications,  however, the reflection coefficient cannot be measured, but  instead only its amplitude can be determined experimentally.  The  phase problem in inverse scattering consists then in solving the  inverse scattering problem despite the lack of phase information  contained in the reflection coefficient.  In general these missing  data introduce genuine non-uniqueness into the problem, and one  must compensate by making use of other kinds of information.  For  example, one might restrict the class of admissible solutions in  some way consistent with the physics of the situation, or  alternatively one might have available some other kinds of data  related to the usual scattering data.  Aside from uniqueness  questions, there is also a need to develop accurate and reliable  computational techniques.  The model problem --- the  one-dimensional inverse scattering problem --- arises in neutr                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       on  and x-ray reflection studies of surface structure.  Related  problems in optics are also studied.  It is natural in such  applications to require the potential to vanish on a half line,  and this substantially, although not completely, removes the  ambiguity due to the missing phase information.  A main goal of  this project is to identify various types of further supplementary  information whose specification allows for unique recovery of the  potential.  Also, numerical methods are developed for computation  of the potential in each case.  An important aspect of the  numerical approach developed here is that ultimately it is only  necessary to solve an optimization problem over a relatively small  dimensional parameter space.       In a number of areas of science and engineering it is of  interest to characterize the chemical structure of surfaces and  interfaces on very small length scales.  Aside from its intrinsic  theoretical interest, this kind of capability has technological  applications, especially in materials science and biology.  One  experimental technique which has received considerable attention  in recent years is the use of so-called reflectivity data: a  carefully prepared beam of x-rays or neutrons is aimed at the  surface whose material properties are sought, and the reflected  beam is carefully measured.  Due to the interaction of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              the beam  with the surface, the reflected beam encodes a great deal of  information about the surface, and one is thus confronted with the  problem of properly interpreting such data.  The main goal of this  project is to investigate certain analytical and numerical methods  for making such inferences.  The reflected beam may be  characterized by amplitude and phase components, but conventional  measuring devices are sensitive only to the amplitude component.  It is well understood that considerable ambiguity in the  interpretation of reflectivity data is associated with the absence  of the phase component.  To compensate for this one hopes to use  various kinds of supplementary information which may be available.  In this project the investigator seeks to elucidate from a  mathematical point of view how it may be possible to incorporate  such extra information into automatic data processing techniques.",
