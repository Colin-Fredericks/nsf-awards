The topics covered include (a) DNA structure and  replication, (b) RNA transcription, translation, and splicing, (c)  genetic recombination, repair, and transposition, (d) genetic  engineering and recombinant DNA technology, and (e) modern genomic  analysis and societal implications. The major challenges in  teaching these fundamental genetic concepts to undergraduates are  (1) transmitting the visual imagery of dynamic molecular processes,  (2) providing a solid intellectual framework to explore  interrelationships between genetic processes, and (3) at more  advanced levels, conveying the experimental basis for evolution of  genetic principles.  The project exploits recent advances in  computer hardware (increased memory size and data storage) and  software (intelligent tutoring systems) to develop a multimedia  tutorial package which conveys the visual imagery, conceptual  relationships, and experimental basis of molecular genetics in a  deeper and more effective manner than currently possible through  lectures or textbooks. The electronic tutor, named \"MOLGENT\", is  being tested during its developmental phase, in a variety of  undergraduate classes, including introductory biology,  microbiology, and molecular and cellular biology courses, and an  innovative senior-level course entitled \"Concepts in Molecular  Genetics\" at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The  effectiveness of tutorials is being monitored and improved through  student discuss ion groups. Once developed, the prototype software  will be promoted via demonstrations at the educational section of  meetings of biological societies (e.g. American Society for  Microbiology, Genetics Society of America, and American Society for  Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) and distributed broadly via  publishers.",
