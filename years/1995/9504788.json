 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504788  Pillay       A substantial part of the project concerns the interaction between   logic and differential algebra.  On the one hand a new Galois theory for   differential fields is developed, using model-theoretic methods (and   generalising the Picard-Vessiot theory), and various inverse Galois   problems are posed.  On the other hand, it is asked whether a differential   field which supports a model-theoretic dimension theory must be   differentially closed (namely contain solutions to all algebraic   differential equations over the field).  Other components of the project   involve (1) more traditional questions in model theory such as determining   the number of models of complete theories, and (2) studying groups   definable in O-minimal theories, which amounts to trying to develop a   reasonable theory of Lie groups over arbitrary real closed fields.       The understanding of collections of symmetries (also called groups)  is an important part of mathematics and of its applications.  Pillay's   project concerns symmetries arising from various situations: differential   equations, algebraic equations, and more abstract contexts.  He will use   methods from logic (specifically model theory) to analyse, identify, and   make connections between such groups of symmetries. The expressive power of   logic thus applied will gain concrete mathematical information.  ***",
