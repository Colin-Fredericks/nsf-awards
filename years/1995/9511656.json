One  learning mechanism that animals use to predict biologically  significant events is Pavlovian conditioning.  For example,  an animal may learn, via Pavlovian conditioning, to predict  food, an encounter with a predator, or access to a potential  mate.  The anticipatory conditioned responses that animals  make may enable them to optimize their interaction with a  subsequently presented biologically significant event (an  unconditioned stimulus or US).    Conditioned stimuli paired with US's such as food, water,  and mating opportunity come to elicit orienting, approach  and search responses.  Obtaining food, water or a  reproductive opportunity can be a long complicated process  involving a sequence of many different behavior patterns.  For example, under certain conditions, the mating behavior  of male quail may be similar to general search behavior,  characterized by increased locomotor activity.  Other  conditions may evoke more direct approach behavior to cues  that signal a mating opportunity.  Dr. Akins' research will  provide information about the circumstances that evoke  various conditioned responses and about the mechanisms of  those responses in reproductive behavior systems.  Furthermore, the results of this investigation will  contribute to our knowledge of the generality of learning  processes in social behavior and the importance of  predictability in social situations.",
