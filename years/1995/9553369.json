 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553369  Clevenger  The University and Community College System of Nevada (UCCSN) will  establish the Nevada Teaching and Research - Enhancement and  Collaboration (TREC) Program. The TREC Program will increase  research capabilities and support within the UCCSN through  strengthened interactions between the UCCSN research institutions  and the community colleges. The program provides mechanisms to  establish collaborative research and scholarly activities between  faculty primarily involved in research and those primarily involved  in teaching. The TREC Program will enhance community college  involvement in Nevada's EPSCoR activities by (1) identifying  research programs within the UCCSN which could provide  opportunities for collaborative research for community  college faculty; (2) identifying research interests and strengths  of community college faculty; (3) facilitating the match of  community college faculty with appropriate university faculty to do  research; and(4) establishing this as an ongoing process over  several years so that most research activities would occur during  the summer months, but regular professional interaction would occur  during the entire year.    The TREC Program will strengthen and enhance Nevada's EPSCoR  Program by increasing UCCSN Support for building the research base;  state budget support for research stimulation; the numbers of  professionals within the System involved in the research  enterprise; commitment to the development of Nevada's science,  engineering, and technology infrastructure through increased  research capabilities; the potential for current UCCSN research  developments to be reflected in educational programs, thereby  enriching these programs; the number of UCCSN faculty involved in  research; capabilities within community colleges to meet the  educational needs for Nevada's diversifying economy, especially in  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and;  professional development and renewal activities for community  col lege faculty.",
