 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455333  McMahon  A three-year program to develop a CD-ROM-based multimedia package  for the teaching of an introductory course in materials science and  engineering is proposed.  It is intended that this package will  serve most of the purposes of the lectures in a traditional course  so that the classroom time can be devoted to the activities  normally carried out in tutorial or recitation sessions.  The  motivation for this is the increase in teaching effectiveness of  such sessions compared to traditional lectures. The package will be  built around animations created with Multimedia Director and  ancillary programs and video segments showing excerpts from  videotaped laboratory experiments created in a separate project, as  well as videotaped lecture demonstrations.  The techniques  necessary for the creation of the animations and for computer-based  editing of video tapes have been developed at Pennsylvania during  the past year, and the equipment and software necessary for this  are already available. The first two years of the project will be  devoted mainly to creation of animations and video segments and to  evaluating them by classroom use. They will be exported to other  institutions via CD-ROM for their use and evaluation.  The  development of the technique of integrating these with text and  voice into an interactive teaching package will also be carried out  in the first two years, and the third year will be devoted to  completing this package and evaluating it in classroom use so that  final adjustments and modifications can be made during the period  of the project.  The teaching package will be based on a new  textbook, now being published, which is part of the development of  a new approach to the subject.  This is a departure from the  traditional type of course in that it reorganizes the subject into  two large case studies, one on structural materials, using the  bicycle, and the other on device materials, using the WalkmanTM.   Experience at Pennsylvania and elsewhere has s hown this to be more  effective that the traditional method in an introductory course,  especially for nonmajors in materials science and engineering.",
