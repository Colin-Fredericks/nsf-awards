The project goals are: to  increase knowledge of botany and zoology; to provide access to  the Internet; to create network communities of students and  teachers from resource-rich and resource-poor schools working  with each other and with scientists from the Arboretum; to  support student investigations; to offer a family science  program; to work with and within the SSI and the Boston USI; and  to disseminate the model to other similar centers.  These goals  are accomplished through summer workshops for teachers, student  field studies, family science programs, and  evaluation/dissemination.  Funding is provided for the teacher  training in the summers (with follow up) and the  evaluation/dissemination.      In its initial stages, the project works with three school  communities adjoining the Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts.   Two-hundred and seventy elementary school teachers receive  courses, field experiences and direct support from the Arboretum.   An additional 150 teachers, primarily from within the state,  receive training through telecommunications and local support.    Cost sharing is estimated at 55%.  ***",
