 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to describe and analyze the grammar  of San Miguel Chimalapa Zoque (MIG Zoque). This is a Mixe-Zoquean  language spoken in southwestern Oaxaca, Mexico. The project will  be the first detailed documentation of MIG Zoque and the first  study of the syntax of any of the Oaxacan Zoque dialects.  Project work involves twelve months of study in Mexico, working  with native speaker consultants to determine the grammatical  structure of the language. Samples of naturally-occurring speech  and narrative texts of various kinds will be recorded,  translated, and analyzed in order to study the discourse  structure of MIG Zoque and to enhance and guide the direct  elicitation process.  The result of the project will be the student investigator's  doctoral dissertation. The project is expected to have  significance for (a) the documentation and description of  Mixe-Zoquean languages, which are rapidly being replaced by  Spanish in all communities; (b) historical work in reconstructing  epi-Olmec, an ancestor of the modern Zoquean languages; (c)  theoretical work in morphosyntax and syntax, by providing current  and usable data on a language with many interesting phenomena at  these levels of the grammar; and (d) the promotion (via the  foregoing) of research on a wide range of languages, especially  those studied in the 'field' and faced with imminent extinction.",
