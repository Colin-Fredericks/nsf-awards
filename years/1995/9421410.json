 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at describing and explaining the morpho-  syntactic changes of Chinese from the third century A.D. to the  present. The investigators have examined a large number of texts,  selecting at least one appropriate item best representing the  vernacular language for each century from the third century A.D.  to the present, and have carried out preliminary investigation  into the diachronic change of a number of morpho-syntactic  structures. A total of twenty-three texts have been chosen, and  they constitute the source of empirical data for the project.       On the basis of the empirical data from the selected  vernacular texts, the PIs will describe the diachronic  development of a dozen morpho-syntactic structures in Chinese  over the three-year course of this project. The ultimate goal of  the project is to prepare a historical grammar of Chinese  covering seventeen centuries of morpho-syntactic change. On the  one hand, the grammar will serve as a reference tool for  linguists as well as sinologists specializing in Chinese  literature, history and cultural studies, on the other hand it  will provide the first overall view of the diachronic drift of an  isolating language which has endured two thousand years without  changing its prototypical isolating status.",
