 "awd_abstract_narration": "Auchincloss  9553445    Teaching Traineeships in Physics for Undergraduate Women is a  two-year pilot project in the Department of Physics and Astronomy,  in cooperation with the Women in Science and Engineering Project.   Women students, who are to be become co-instructors in the physics  laboratory courses taught by graduate teaching assistants, are to  be recruited from the top-scoring sophomores and juniors (not just  physics majors) who have taken the introductory laboratory courses.   The undergraduate trainees will participate in a special two-week  training session during the summer, as well as in training sessions  throughout the academic year.  Each trainee will be paired with a  graduate teaching assistant (TA), and assigned to a specific  laboratory section.  Most instructional duties (except grading)  will be shared equally by the lead TA and the trainee (e.g., the  graduate and undergraduate TAs will alternate in presenting the  15-minute introductions to the laboratory exercises).  Thus, the  trainees can acquire valuable experience as well as have visible  classroom responsibility.    The proposed traineeship effort aims to improve the long-term  retention of college women in science, fulfilling the immediate  need of recognizing achievement and encouraging further commitment  to science of talented undergraduate women science majors at an  early stage.  By design, this project also increases the number of  women instructors in physics laboratory courses, creating a more  gender-equitable environment than now exists for all students in  introductory physics, and providing female role models for  first-year women students.  The project should positively impact  the instruction in physics labs, by increasing not only the  number of instructors in each laboratory section, but also the  number of competent instructors, through the training and  supervision which will be provided through the project.  Thus, the  project expects to have a positive impact upon the quality of  college  science education, as well as upon the trainees. The latter  are to be recognized for their prior academic achievement, and  through participation in a proven teaching program, increase their  skills and leadership abilities. The teaching process involves them  as significant members of the Department and strengthens their  preparation for graduate work in science or science education.   Additionally, these women trainees serve as peer-mentors and role  models to the undergraduate women and men in their laboratory  sections, conveying through their presence the message that  \"science is for everyone.\" It is anticipated that after the pilot  effort is completed, the traineeship program will be  institutionalized and supported with Physics Department funds.    The demonstrated competence of the trainees and the increased  satisfaction ratings from students in the labs should provide an  incentive for other departments with large enrollments in  laboratory courses to create similar traineeship opportunities for  undergraduate women.    ***",
