 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402055  Freeman    This experimental research program is designed to explore the synthesis and gas sorption, transport, and permeation properties of a new class of highly soluble wholly aromatic polyamides, having either ridded rod, possibly mesogenic, backbones or semi-rodlike backbones and structural elements which could be precursors for further reactions such as crosslinking or the attachment of pendent rigid or flexible groups.  These fundamental studies are directed toward developing an expanded and more subtle repertoire of structural modifications useful for the rational tailoring of super-membranes and super-barriers.  Central to the thesis under consideration is the notion that the proposed primary chemical structure variations could markedly influence polymer suprastructure (i.e. polymer chain packing), polymer-penetrant interactions, and, in turn, strongly affect gas sorption, transport, and permeation properties.    An experimental program is proposed involving controlled synthesis of highly soluble wholly aromatic polyamides having substituents which could be used to crosslink the polymers or attach rigid or flexible side chains.  The chemical structure, physicals properties, and gas transport properties of these polymers would be characterized to determine explicitly the influence of side and main chain molecular architecture and side chain stiffness, plus the potential for crosslinking, on the overall sorption, transport, and permeation behavior.    This research program would benefit from collaborative interactions with researchers at the Hoechst Celanese Corporation, a world leader in the production of high performance, high barrier liquid crystalline polymers.  This collaboration would involve several visits per year by principal investigators and students associated with the proposed program to Hoechst ,elanese facilities.  Moreover, Hoechst Celanese personnel would visit NC State several times per year to coordinate the objectives of our research program with theirs.    In  addition, computer modeling and synthesis will be provided by Spanish researchers at the Instituto de Ciencia Y Tecnologia de Polimeros of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) in Madrid, Spain.  This group, under the direction of Dr. Javier de Abajo, has worked very closely with the PIs during the past several year.  This collaborative research program has already resulted in approximately 10 research publications related to the synthesis and gas transport characterization of polymers similar to the polymers described in this proposal.  The exchange has stimulated several visits by PIs from both sides and students.  The collaboration would be expanded in the proposed research program to take advantage of the extensive computer modeling capabilities and expertise of our Spanish partners as well as their extensive experience in the area of novel polymer synthesis.   ***",
