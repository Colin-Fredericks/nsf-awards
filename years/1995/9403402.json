 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beale       The investigator undertakes four projects related to  incompressible fluid flow.  The first continues work on numerical  methods for the motion of inviscid fluid interfaces, such as water  waves.  In previous work, convergent methods of boundary integral  type have been developed, using a new approach for the analysis of  fluid interfaces.  In this project, methods of more general  applicability are designed that still maintain full numerical  stability.  In a related project, improved analytical understanding  is sought for existence and regularity in exact solutions of the  fully nonlinear equations of water waves.  Instabilities in exact  vortex rings with swirl are studied, comparing predictions from a  short-wave asymptotic analysis with direct simulation using vortex  methods, in which computational elements of vorticity move with  the flow.  These two very different approaches should allow  detailed treatment of this test case for time-dependent, inviscid  three-dimensional flow.  Finally, the approximation of the  Navier-Stokes equations of viscous flow by fractional time steps  are investigated, in which inviscid flow alternates with linear  viscosity, and artificial boundary layers are generated.       Fluid flow is important in diverse applications, including  aircraft design, industrial processes, and the motion of the  oceans and atmosphere.  Often quantitative prediction is difficult  because of the development of small scales in the flows -- for  instance, local disturbances in the general behavior of the flows.  One role for mathematical analysis is the design of improved  numerical methods.  For complicated equations, such as those of  inviscid fluid interfaces, numerical instabilities have been  difficult to avoid.  Carefully designed methods, such as those  developed here, could be used for better predictions of the  behavior of water waves.  Basic analytical understanding of  solutions is often closely related to the analysis of numerical  approximations.  The com parison of two methods for predicting  instabilities in fluid flow, short-wave analysis and direct  simulation by vortex methods, should help to establish the realm  of validity of each approach.  The use of the two together for a  quantitative study of exact solutions, such as vortex rings with  swirl, is advantageous for better understanding of nonlinear  dynamics in realistic three-dimensional flow.  The fractional step  approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations replaces the full  evolution by two parts of more special character.  Some numerical  methods take advantage of this dual structure.  Better  understanding of such approximations, especially the boundary  behavior, could suggest more accurate versions of these numerical  schemes.",
