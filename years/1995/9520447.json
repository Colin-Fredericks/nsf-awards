 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520447  Bernstein              The Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of  Michigan will purchase a real-time control processor and related  diagnostic equipment that will be dedicated to support research  in engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research  projects, including, in particular:  control of a rotating  actuator, control of noise, control of rotating imbalance,  control of combustion, and control os slosh.         Control-system technology is an enabling technology for many  complex, high performance systems.  In many of these applications  the control system is so essential that the system simply cannot  operate without it.  On the other hand, failure of the control  system can have dire consequences.  Graphic examples include the  Chernobyl disaster and Airbus crashes.  In view of the importance  and risks of control-system technology, this proposal seeks  laboratory equipment in the form of a real-time control processor  and related equipment to allow researchers to carry out a broad  range of experiments in feedback control technology.         The equipment to be purchased under this grant will allow us  to upgrade and expand our current control laboratory facilities.   Multichannel identification and control capabilities will be used  to implement and assess the performance of multivariable  controllers.  Our goal is to develop a vertically integrated  control laboratory in which data is passed seamlessly from  identification experiments to control law synthesis and,,  finally, to real-time code generation for implementation and  testing.  This high degree of integration will be critical for  exploiting and demonstrating the capabilities of new developments  in control technology for a variety of applications.  ***",
