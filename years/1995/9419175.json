The proposal focuses on Src  (the product of the v-src oncogene, v-Src, and its cellular  homolog, c-Src, are known collectively as Src); the working  hypothesis is that membrane binding requires both the hydrophobic  insertion of the NH2-terminal myristate into the bilayer and the  electrostatic interaction of a cluster of adjacent basic residues  with acidic lipids.  There are four specific projects. 1)  Developing a simple model that describes the synergistic effect of  myristate and basic residues on the binding of Src to phospholipid  membranes and testing this model by measuring the membrane binding  of myristoylated and nonmyristoylated peptides corresponding to the  NH2-terminal region of Src. 2) Confirming that the basic residues  in the NH2-terminal region of Src are responsible for the  electrostatic component of protein-membrane interaction by  measuring the membrane binding of native v-Src and c-Src as well as  mutant and chimeric versions of these proteins. 3) Measuring the  effect of phosphorylation by C and A kinases on the membrane  binding of both Src and corresponding peptides. 4) Constructing a  molecular model of a phospholipid bilayer and the NH2-terminal  region of Src, then using the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation  to calculate theoretically the electrostatic component of the  binding.  The project is significant because membrane binding is  crucial to the function of Src.  The biophysical principles that  emerge should be applicable to some other myristoylated (e.g.  MARCKS) and farnesylated (e.g. K-Ras) proteins.  %%%  The overall objective is to understand the molecular mechanism by  which proteins containing myristate, a 14 carbon acyl chain,  interact with biological membranes.
