 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is in the  general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the  subfield of bioanalytical chemistry.  During the tenure of this  three-year continuing grant, Professor Larive and her students at  the University of Kansas will pursue research designed to provide  a detailed understanding of the relationships between peptide  primary structure, three-dimensional conformation, and aggregation.   These studies will involve five specific aims, namely (1) to  understand the importance of primary structure in aggregation; (2)  to perform peptide conformation analysis; (3) to measure peptide  diffusion coefficients; (4) to develop an aggregation model; and  (5) to test the model by examining aggregation under various  conditions of solvent, temperature, pH, and ionic strength.  A  family of synthetic peptides based on systematic alteration of  primary structure of a sixteen-residue sequence will be examined  using a suite of experimental techniques featuring nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD).  The results of these  studies should indicate the relative contributions of hydrogen  bonding, dipolar interactions, and hydrophobic contacts to the  stabilization of aggregates of these peptides.  Also during this  grant period, Professor Larive will pursue an educational  development plan that includes the reorganization and  revitalization of the undergraduate analytical chemistry  laboratory, introduction of an environmental option for chemistry  majors, and increasing the involvement of undergraduates in  research.    Peptide and protein aggregation is a fundamentally and practically  important problem.  By exploring the effects of solution conditions  such as solvent, pH, and ionic strength, this CAREER research  project will produce a foundation of experimental results which  will be useful in controlling aggregation of proteins expressed for  research, therapeutic, or commercial purposes.  The educational  developmen t aspects of this CAREER project will enrich and broaden  the undergraduate analytical chemistry curriculum at the University  of Kansas.",
