 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Defense (DoD) has funded the first-year  development activities necessary to create a two-year Community  College Associate of Arts Degree in Environmental Technology.   Kansas State University (KSU), as one of the recipients of the  funding, has assembled faculty teams to write the curriculum and a  media production team to produce and disseminate it.  Although it  was the original intent of the DoD, it is now apparent  subsequent-year funding will not be forthcoming.  Consequently, the  National Science Foundation (NSF) has a rare opportunity to fund a  program in which $840,000 of infrastructure is already in place.   For example, there are 20-plus committed community colleges  prepared to implement the curriculum and develop second-year  courses.  A national consortium of industry supporters, such as  AFL/CIO, Boeing, and Allied Signal Aerospace, Inc., are on-board to  advise on program development.  State-of-the-art technologies, such  as satellite instructional delivery access, CD-ROM development  equipment, and media production equipment, have been purchased and  totally committed to this program.  Current funding from the DoD is  being used to develop curriculum materials, but second, third, and  fourth-year funding is absolutely necessary to implement the  curriculum.  Full development and implementation of the complete  two-year environmental technology program will not occur without  NSF support.  The proposal explicitly demonstrates the  infrastructures already created by DoD's first-year funding, and  clearly emphasizes activities necessary for program completion by  subsequent-year funding from the NSF.",
