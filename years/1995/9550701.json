 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550701  Price       Xavier University (XU) of Louisiana's Alliance for Minority  Participation (AMP) program represents the combined resources,  facilities and faculties of 13 private, historically black members  of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) in the Tennessee area:   Bennett, Fisk, Knoxville, Lane, Lemoyne-Owen, Oakwood, Philander  Smith, Rust, St. Augustine's, St. Paul's, Shaw, and VA Union.  With  strength in the natural sciences and in undergraduate research  capacity, the XU AMP's goal is to double, within five years, its  combined science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) graduation  rate.  Improving SEM student retention rates, particularly among  students with strong intellectual promise but poor academic  preparation, will be a primary objective, as well as increasing  enrollments in the physical sciences and mathematics.       The AMP's goal and objectives will be accomplished by:  three,  new, shared bridge programs for entering freshmen; new entry level  physical science and math courses patterned after those that are  successfully offered by Xavier; improved articulation within dual-  degree engineering programs; and expanded opportunities for paid  and mentored undergraduate research experiences each summer in  industry, graduate institutions, and external research laboratories  for bridge program participants as they become sophomores, juniors  and seniors.       Working collaboratively, 12 Campus Coordinators will seek and  implement articulation agreements for students with selected  graduate institutions; effect share access to on-line academic  resources for students; organize undergraduate research  conferences, and develop academic support strategies in the context  of each participating campus and its students.  In addition, UNCF  will contribute funds for scholarships and academic supports to the  program, as well as its fund-raising and media expertise.       Over five years, the program will impact 4,712 students, all  of whom will be African Americans, raisi ng the number of graduates  from the 1994 figure of 388 to 816.  The increase in SEM graduates  will represent a seven and one-half increase in the national  production -- from institutions that enroll just one percent of the  Nation's African American college students.       Dr. Leonard Price, past Chair of XU's Chemistry Department,  and a distinguished African American educator and researcher, will  be Principal Investigator.  Dr. Willie E. May, Chief of the  Chemistry Analytical Division of the National Institute of  Standards and Technology, will be Chairman of the AMP's Advisory  Board.  William H. Gray, III, President of UNCF, will serve as  Chairman of the AMP's Governing Board, which initially will be  composed of the presidents of the participating institutions but  expanded to include national educational and SEM experts and  officials.       Ongoing program assessment will inform the AMP's advisors and  administrators and the program.  It will be comprised of:  data  gathering to monitor progress toward the goals, and evaluation to  determine the effectiveness, quality, and acceptance of the  program's various components.",
