 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416634  Bronk    The dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) pool is emerging as a  dynamic component of marine nitrogen cycles.  Though DON can  represent the largest pool of fixed nitrogen in marine  systems, the lack of suitable methods has kept information  on its utilization largely limited to a few individual  organic compounds such as amino acids or urea.  Despite the  lack of knowledge on utilization of the bulk of the  undefined DON pool, bacteria are considered the primary  users of DON in marine systems (with the exception of urea).  Recent work in phytoplankton enzymology, however, suggests  this assumption needs to be reevaluated.  Some phytoplankton  are now known to posses cell surface oxidases which allow  them to cleave amino groups from amino acids, primary  amines, and potentially other organic compounds.  The  phytoplankton known to posses these oxidases are smaller  autotrophs which could potentially be included in the  \"bacterial\" size fraction in traditional size fractionation  experiments.    This Row Planning Grant project will combine the powerful  tools of flow cytometry and newly developed 15N tracer  techniques to discriminate autotrophic from heterotrophic  uptake of DON.  The objectives of this Planning Grant are to  (1)  refine existing cell sorting techniques for separating  autotrophs from heterotrophs in large enough numbers to  allow the measurement of 15N atom % enrichments and thus  allow the measurement of DON uptake rates by autotrophs, and  (2) to obtain preliminary data on uptake of DON by  autotrophs in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific to be used  in support of a full scale NSF proposal.  ***",
