 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511365  Edward Keller    Saccadic eye movements are among the most rapid and accurate  movements that humans are capable of executing, but the  mechanical system producing eye movements is relatively simple in  comparison to limb movements. Therefore, the saccadic system has  served as a model system for gaining insights into the general  problem of how the brain generates motor control. This project is  to examine how two-dimensional sensory information from the  visual system is turned into the highly distributed neuronal  control signals from the brain that move the eyes to produce  highly efficient examination of our surroundings, for example,  during reading. These scientists will use artificial neural  networks and optimization techniques to model how movement  commands are developed in neural structures in the brain such as  the nonlinear maps of visual space and maps of the motor space.  Saccades are controlled by internal feedback about eye position  during a movement, but not direct visual input, because the  visual messages are too slow to provide compensation during the  saccade. These scientists are testing their hypothesis that  shifts in the populations of active cells in these maps in the  brain are driven by the internal feedback signal and actively  control the trajectory of the eyes during the movement. Their  work will help us to understand both how eye movements and other  kinds of movement, such as fine motor control or human gait, are  controlled by the brain.",
