 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421043  Hochstrasser    This research is focused on two main areas arising from  recent technological advances in optical and infrared  femtosecond pulse generation and near-field microscopy.  Linear and nonlinear infrared properties of materials in the  teraherz and the vibrational fundamental region are now  accessible with time resolution in the 40-160 fs regime.  These methods will be used to determine directly the nuclear  responses, over a wide frequency range, to charge  reorganization in conjugated polymers, charge transfer  complexes and their crystals. Impulsive excitations of the  nuclear motions leads to wavepackets whose motion in time  can be used to characterize the potential surfaces involved.  The vibrational energy dynamics also will be studied  directly. A complete study of the higher exciton states of  materials with confined excitations on linear chains of  polysilanes will be conducted to understand the excited  states of such chains in which the electron and hole are  more separated. The second area of the proposed research is  concerned with the dynamics and electronic properties of  organic nanoscale systems using near-field methods. The  materials to be characterized include: self assembled  monolayers of proteins (on semiconductors) that can undergo  energy and electron transfer with single protein spatial  resolution; polysilane films and stretched films in which  linear chain excitations can be separately examined;  aggregates of cyanine dyes having coherence lengths larger  than the tip size of the near-field microscope; and organic  nanoparticles that can be separately examined and their  confinement properties characterized.  %%%  The proposed research is in two main areas arising from our  recent technological advances in optical and infrared  femtosecond pulse generation and near-field microscopy. The  first involves characterization of the femtosecond  vibrational and electronic responses of materials in the  infrared region of the spectrum from close to zero  frequency  to 8000 cm-1. The second is the determination of optical  properties of nanoscopic and low dimensional organic, bio  and polymeric materials by means of the newly developed near-  field picosecond time resolved microscopy. This work is  important because: 1) infrared properties of materials,  particularly organic and biomaterial are not widely explored  yet, and 2) it allows examining nanoenvironment in materials  on the scale of single, isolated molecule.",
