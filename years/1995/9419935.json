 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are requesting matching funds for the purchase of five centrifuges  and associated rotors to use in plant biochemistry and molecular  biology research being carried out by eight investigators in the  Institute of Biological Chemistry at Washington State University. Our  current roster lists 85 graduate or postgraduate researchers and  technicians. These full-time scientists, together with about 20  undergraduates, share 4 ultracentrifuges and 7 high speed centrifuges.  The demand on available centrifuges has increased to the point where it  is often difficult to schedule a centrifuge or rotor and we currently  depend on an adjacent department for access to two special use  centrifuges. The need for centrifuges and rotors has increased  considerably over the last six years due to the addition of Drs. Kahn,  Browse and Lewis, the growth of other research groups and the extension  of several programs into molecular biology. In addition, there are  commitments to add two new faculty positions within the next 2 years.  These new groups will place further demands on our centrifugation  capabilities.    The Fellows of the Institute have research programs of national and  international prominence in the broad areas of plant productivity,  plant metabolism, plant protection, and signalling and recognition  processes in plants. The principal investigator studies plant gene  regulation, especially during the development of complex plant tissues.  Other programs investigate the synthesis of plant storage molecules  such as lipids, starch and storage proteins, symbiotic nitrogen  fixation, plant \"secondary\" compounds such as terpenoids,  phenylpropanoids, cyclitols and oxalate, plant structural materials,  molecules that are used to carry information between plant cells and  the mechanisms by which the cells alter their gene expression in  response to these signals. The research is heavily dependent on  centrifugation to isolate and purify specialized cells, cell  components, cell walls, organelles, membr anes, proteins, DNA and mRNA.  Our centrifuge inventory is outdated and inadequate--the average age of  our ultracentrifuge rotors is 12.6 years and only one is less than 10  years old. In addition to upgrading our existing centrifuges,  acquisition of new types of centrifuges and rotors will allow  procedures and a number of specialized methods to be carried out much  more efficiently and will permit the investigation of new research  areas.",
