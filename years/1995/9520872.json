Increasingly, indigenous peoples are turning to international law in efforts to achieve greater self-determination.  This project will involve a preliminary evaluation of the capacity of international and human rights law to address these efforts.  It will be based on a case study of one American Indian nation's involvement in the international legal arena as part of a worldwide movement.  The case study will draw upon fieldwork in the local, national, and international contexts in which this group works.    %%%%  The last several decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in the use of international and human rights law to resolve conflicts.
