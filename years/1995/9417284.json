 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417284  Manghnani    This award supports the participation of eight U.S. scientists in a  U.S.-Japan seminar on High Pressure-Temperature Research on Earth  and Planetary Materials, to be held in Hawaii from January 23-26,  1996.  The co-organizers are Dr. Murli Manghnani of the University  of Hawaii and Professor Yasuhiko Syono of Tohoku University. The  main purpose of this seminar is to enable the exchange of information  and ideas on the recent experimental and theoretical results in high  pressure-high temperature research in mineral physics.  Recent  progress, future problems, evaluation of theoretical issues related to  experimental results, pressure calibration scales at high temperature  in international use, as well as the applications of recent research  results to the Earth and planetary interiors will be discussed.    This meeting is the fifth in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in this  field held over a period of 20 years.  Although a core of individuals  has provided continuity from meeting to meeting, participants in the  seminars have changed through the years to reflect an appropriate  pairing between U.S. and Japanese participants and the progress of the  research.  The U.S. participants provide a broad cross section of  expertise and geographical representation in the overall area of  ultrahigh pressure-temperature techniques, and were selected on the  basis of being the most active researchers in the U.S. Therefore, this  proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
