The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Eric E. Lowenthal to work with Dr. Paul  Ratnasamy of the National Chemical Laboratory in Pune,  India.    The initial research under this award will focus on the  evaluation of Ti- and V-metallosilicates, specifically, the  larger pore materials, V-NCL-1 and amorphous  titanosilicates, for the catalytic, gas-phase partial  oxidation of propylene using molecular oxygen diluted in an  inert gas such as argon or helium.  Experiments to assess  the activity and product selectivity of these catalysts, as  well as to collect reaction data suitable for micro kinetic  analysis of relative reaction rates will be carried out in  fixed-bed microreactors.  Product identification and  analysis will be carried out using a combination of gas  chromotography and mass spectrometry.  The production of  deeper oxidation products than epoxides such as alcohols,  aldehydes, and ketones will be of scientific and industrial  interest.  Such products could indirectly establish the  nature of the surface intermediates in the propylene-oxygen  reaction network on these metallosilicate materials.  The  nature of the partial oxidation product slate could direct  readily implemented catalyst or reaction condition  modifications. ***",
