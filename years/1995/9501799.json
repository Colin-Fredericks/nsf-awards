 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project will investigate operating system and  application issues in a network that includes mobile and  wireless hosts.  Recent advances in wireless technologies  and light-weight computers make it  attractive to build  networks that combine traditional workstations and servers  with portable computers. But portables will not achieve  equivalence to  stationary hosts unless the portables can  remain continuously connected  to the  network, even when changing locations or  communication devices.    The project,  called MosquitoNet, will  increase the  connectivity of mobile hosts using the  following approaches.    (1) Enable portable computers to move seamlessly from  one  communications medium to another; for example, from an  Ethernet connection  to a wireless modem, without rebooting  or restarting applications.    (2)  Determine the feasibility of hiding the resulting changes  in throughput,  latency and other network characteristics  from applications.    (3) Design a  simple interface to expose these changing  characteristics to applications as  necessary.    (4) Examine communication device usage patterns for use in  implementing battery life extension policies.    (5) Develop new file data  consistency algorithms for use in a  distributed mobile environment where  disconnection is  allowed but not mandatory.    The educational component of the  CAREER project will  modernize and vitalize the teaching of operating systems  and  distributed systems at the Stanford University. In  particular a new course  on wireless and mobile computing  will be introduced along with the introduction  of  new  teaching tools, topics and projects into the current  curriculum on  opepating systems and distributed systems.",
