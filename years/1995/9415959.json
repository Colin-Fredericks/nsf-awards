These actions  occur both prior to certain impacts (e.g., hurricanes), and after  others  (e.g.,  earthquakes).  The project,  whose  primary  data  source   will  be  interviews  conducted  following   six   major  disasters, will provide a new empirical basis for both theory and  applications  in preparedness for such disasters as  earthquakes,  hurricanes and floods.  The project will fill an important gap in  knowledge, since no prior comparative work has been published  on  this  topic,  and will also provide a new empirical  base  for  a  variety of training tools for both emergency managers and private  firm executives.  ***",
