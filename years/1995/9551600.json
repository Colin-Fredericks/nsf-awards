 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal increases the conceptual understanding of students  in the introductory algebra-based physics course, the  introductory calculus-based physics course, and the survey of  physics course (for non-science-majors) and makes clearer at an  earlier stage the connection between the scientific method and  the physics lab.   This is accomplished by introduction of  Workshop Physics, Tools for Scientific Thinking, Real-Time  Physics, and Microcomputer-Based Laboratory curricula.   Twelve  Macintosh Quadras provide the heart of the new physics  laboratory, and a host of probes interfaced with the computers  enables the students to gather and reduce data for further  analysis.   Students in the algebra- and calculus-based physics  courses learn the greater percentage of their physics from these  labs, eliminating to a large extent the lecture portions of these  courses.   The curricular materials are being locally modified to  restructure the lecture and laboratory presentation in the survey  of physics course for non-science-majors.",
