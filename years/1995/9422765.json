 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422765  Beck  The purpose of this research is to develop a theoretical and  empirical foundation for the liquidity demand for money.  This  research extends the investigator's previous work on the theory  of the value of money.  In that work money was modelled as a call  option on capital gains opportunities in securities.  Two stages  of research are planned. The first is to incorporate the  liquidity value of money in a simple intertemporal general  equilibrium model to derive the liquidity demand for money  function.  This macroeconomic model will be used as the basis for  extensions to more realistic applications in future research.   The second stage is to estimate the money demand function implied  by the theory.  Since the function changes over the range of  interest rates, regime-switching time series techniques will be  investigated.  Evidence will be obtained on the validity of this  theory of liquidity demand.  The results of this study will  determine the feasibility of modelling the liquidity demand for  money based on this theory; they will also serve as a foundation  for future research on other applications of the option value  approach to pricing liquidity.  ***",
