 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523113  Espinosa  The proposed research deals with a combined experimental and  theoretical approach using impact loading to study the influence of  microstructural features on failure of ceramics.  The experimental  approach uses novel plate and impact experiments where the  magnitude and duration of stress pulses can be selected so that the  damage event is stable and its evolution can be monitored under  well defined deformation histories.  As a result, damage evolution  rather than final accumulated damage can be identified.  These  results will form the basis for comprehensive understanding of the  processes occurring during inelastic deformation and formulation of  physically based constitutive equations.  Interferometrically  measured velocity histories will be used in the examination of  formulated models.  Correlation between measured and numerically  computed velocity histories will be accomplished by performing  numerical simulations of the experiments with inelastic models  accounting for the observed failure mechanisms.  ***",
