Politically, they sought to shift  control of the government from aristocrats to commoners,  especially the commercial class.  In the realm of economics, they  repudiated the protectionist policies of mercantilism. They  believed that free trade and democratization,l beneficial in  their own right, would also reduce the incidence of war.  Their  views continue to inform theoretical and policy debates.    The relationship between democracy and international conflict has  received careful attention in recent scholarship on international  relations; a wide range of formal and empirical studies have  established that democracies rarely fight each other, even at  relatively low levels of violence.  The relationship between  economic interdependence and international conflict, however, has  received less systematic attention.  During the past year the  investigators have conducted new analyses on the period 1950-1986  that incorporate a measure of economic interdependence derived  from bilateral trade flows.  Following closely earlier analyses  of the effect of democracy on conflict, the researchers found  that economic interdependence also has important effects in  reducing conflict.    In this project the investigators extend this line of research by  estimating a model to clarity the reciprocal influence between  trade and international conflict.  They also evaluate the  pacifying influence of democracy and economic interdependence  while controlling for the expected utility of the use of force.   In the process the researchers explore whether democratic  countries are more likely to trade with each other than with non-  democracies, check the implications of new measures for joint  democracy and economic interdependence., apply new sensitivity  checks on the findings, and extend the dataset into the 1990s to  assess the impact of the recent dramatic spread of democracy in  the post-cold  war world.  ***",
