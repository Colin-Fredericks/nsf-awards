 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports a collaboration by Dr. Paul S. Russo, of the Chemistry Department at Louisiana State University (LSU) and Dr. Zuhal Kucukyavuz  and Dr. Savas Kucukyavuz of the Chemistry Department at the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey.  In this collaboration they will study the phase stability and dynamics of ternary polymer solutions.  The specific classes to be investigated will be systems where rigid rodlike polymers and flexible polymers are mixed together in a common solvent.  Such systems represent precursors to molecular composites wherein a random coil polymer is strengthened by the fibrous, rodlike polymer.  Light scattering studies will be conducted on specially selected prototype systems, with special attention given to `fuzzy rods` made from polypeptides with long alkyl sidechains.  The long sidechains impart good stability to the fuzzy rods, which will be studied in tetrahydrofuran when they scatter strongly.  The random coil component will be polydimethysiloxanes, which scatters only weakly in tetrahydrofuran.  Polydimethylsiloxanes will be prepared and characterized at the METU in Ankara.  Light scattering measurements will be performed at LSU in Baton Rouge.  Scope :  The collaboration to be supported in this project is useful to the US and to Turkey because it allows the two scientists to use their complementary capabilities to enhance the effectiveness of their research.  Dr. Russo is currently supported by NSF's Division of Material Research for the primary research.  The funds provided by INT will be used for the incremental costs resulting from the collaboration.",
