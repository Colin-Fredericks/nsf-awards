 "awd_abstract_narration": "The polar regions are the areas of the earth where the effects of  increased ultraviolet radiation first can be detected.  Indications  of increased ultraviolet radiation have been reported in both polar  regions.  Increased ultraviolet radiation can have severe effects  on humans, as well as on marine and terrestrial ecosystems.  The  Arctic, with a population of millions of people (including  indigenous populations) may be the first populated area to be  affected.  Some major changes may have to occur in northern  societies and settlements, especially those harvesting marine and  terrestrial ecosystems.  In a few years this issue may become a  concern for media, with the public and politicians asking the  science community what we know and what should be done.    The International Arctic Science Committee, of which the United  States is a member, has initiated a process leading to a report  summarizing our present knowledge, and a science plan covering  effects on humans, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and possibly  effects on northern societies and settlements.  This award will  provide partial support for a small workshop of experts to  summarize the results of a 1994 open scientific meeting on the  effects of ultraviolet radiation in the Arctic.  The workshop is  co-sponsored by the Scientific Committee on Problems of the  Environment.  The report will summarize the current state of  knowledge and help prioritize research topics in this important  field of Arctic research.",
