 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9550003  *BOWEN*  The University of Washington was awarded a three-year grant in  1992 from the National Science Foundation to undertake activities  to recruit and retain students with disabilities in science,  engineering, and mathematics (SEM) programs.  The project is  called DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and  Technology).  DO-IT has helped high school students with  disabilities realize their academic and career potential, and  transition to college studies in SEM; SEM faculty have become  more receptive and capable of including students with  disabilities in their courses; and parents, service providers,  and the public have become more aware of the potential  contributions and special needs in SEM fields of individuals with  disabilities.    Specific DO-IT activities proposed for continuation include: (1)  summer study programs which allow high school students with  disabilities to explore SEM fields and learn college transition  skills and strategies; (2) a mentoring program that matches high  school students with disabilities with successful role models in  SEM academic programs and careers; (3) Internet access for  communication and information retrieval; (4) disability awareness  presentations to faculty; (5) transition and adaptive technology  workshops; and (6) dissemination of program and disability-  related information through electronic resources, printed  materials, and videotapes.  DO-IT efforts are proposed to be  extended to:  (1) make undergraduate campus SEM programs more  accessible to individuals with disabilities; (2) help students  with disabilities successfully complete college; (3) help  students transition to employment and graduate studies; (4)  increase outreach efforts to students with disabilities; (5)  identify factors leading to college completion and employment in  SEM; and (6) increase dissemination activities.",
