 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320782  Sabbagh   This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will support the development of an advanced  computational model for electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation  (NDE).  The model permits the calculation of the interaction  between a probe and a flaw that is located within a workplace.   It is based on a currently existing model that is being developed  by Sabbagh Associates, but will be extended to include the  capability of modeling flaws located near edges and corners, as  well as to model arrays of probes.  The project will also  integrate recent research in the areas of volume-integral and  boundary-integral equations in computational electromagnetics,  including the use of vector boundary elements and Whitney forms.    The result will be an advanced commercial software package that  can be used in fields as diverse as nondestructive evaluation,  medical imaging, geophysical prospecting, and materials  evaluation.",
