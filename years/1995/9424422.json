 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424422  Gera    This award supports a 9-month Postdoctoral Fellowship for  Dr. Dinesh Gera, Research Assistant Professor at West  Virginia University.  This fellowship opportunity will  enable Dr. Gera to begin a collaborative research effort  with Professor Yutaka Tsuji of Osaka University. The  investigators propose to apply a Discrete Particle  Simulation (DPS) technique to predict the motion of a large  number of particles in various cases such as dense flows and  disperse phase flows. The purpose of this collaboration is  to develop the DPS technique for fluidized beds in order to  provide quantitative agreement with actual phenomena. The  DPS technique was developed by Prof. Tsuji's group and many  researchers are now to applying this preliminary model in  their simulation techniques.    As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Gera will have the opportunity  to become familiar with research techniques and equipment at  Osaka University while contributing to the overall research  effort. After becoming acquainted with their simulation  techniques, experimental equipment, and procedures, Dr. Gera  intends to continue his research efforts at West Virginia  University. The 9-month visit by Dr. Gera will help him to  establish a personal and professional link with a leading  researcher in Japan. The publications resulting from this  project will be beneficial to researchers in the \"multiphase  community\" in the United States, Japan, China, and Europe.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the  Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international collaboration.  ***",
