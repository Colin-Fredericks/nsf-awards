 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project advances knowledge about how to give  computer  users  convincingly real haptic (sense of touch) interaction  with  computers.  While there has been some progress in this  area,  chiefly  through the use of back-driven  robotic-like  manipulators,  this  is a substantially new  approach  which  promises   a  qualitative  leap  in  improvement   of   such  capabilities: A user interacts with the computer by grasping  arigid   tool  whose  behavioral  description  is  computed,  employing  this tool to interact with computed  environments  which   are   semantically  meaningful  in  terms   of   the  application.   At  the  same time,  the  environment  exerts  realistic forces and torques on the tool's handle which  are  felt  by  the  user.   The vision is one  of  providing  the  computer  user  immediate, high-fidelity, convincingly  real  interaction  with  computed  environments.  The  new  haptic  interface approach is based on a recently developed magnetic  levitation technology, and on recent strong advances in  the  art of physically-based simulation.  The magnetic levitation  technology  uses  Lorentz  forces  to  stably  levitate  and  control  a  rigid  body (which includes the  handle  through  which  the user interacts) in six degrees of freedom, giving  a  new  and heretofore unexplored physical basis for  haptic  interaction.   The  new  simulation  methods  are  based  on  special-purpose  techniques  that  promise  to  be  simpler,  faster,  and  more  robust than their generic  counterparts.  Robust  realistic  physical simulation, coupled  with  high-  bandwidth  six-degree-of-freedom force reflection,  has  the  potential  to greatly improve the state of the  art  in  the  feel,  performance, and capabilities of virtual  environment  systems for use in a wide range of human activities.",
