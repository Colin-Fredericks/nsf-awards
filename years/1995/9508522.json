This research is a continuation of studies of a class  of materials that so far had been virtual y unexplored considerable  technological utility. These include titanium nitride for wear  resistant coatings on machine tools, aluminum nitride as a high  thermal conductivity ceramic, and silicon nitride in numerous  applications where hard impervious films are needed and can be  deposited by low temperature chemical processes, as well as in bulk  ceramics. This research will address the development of general  methods for the preparation of small single crystals of the new  phases to facilitate crystal structure determination, and the  examination of materials that contain continuous networks of  transition metal nitrogen bonds in one, two and especially three  dimensions. The continuous network compounds are expected to  exhibit a wider variety of physical properties and to be  mechanically and chemically more robust. The synthetic methods to  be used include preparation from oxides in flowing ammonia, growth  of crystals from metallic fluxes, and high pressures and at  temperatures from 500 to 1700  C. The structures of the compounds  prepared will be determined by x-ray diffraction, and the  electrical, magnetic and thermal properties will be determined. In  some cases chemical properties, such as catalytic activity or redox  chemistry at low temperatures (i.e soft chemistry such as  intercalation) will also be examined. The chemical and structural  behavior of these materials will be compared to related compounds  such as oxides, sulfides or phosphides.   %%%  This research team has pioneered the study of ternary metal  nitrides and discovered many new phases. The structure of some  nitrides have shown that both the structural features and  properties of some of them are rather unique. Yet there are many  more systems left to investigate.  These include compounds that are  stabilized by alkali metals other than lithium, or by rare earth  metals. There remain significant challenges in the preparation of  single crystals and in compounds that are rich in the transition  metal. The proposed research outlines approaches to these  challenges and propose to continue the attack on this previously  neglected family of materials. The expectation is that some of  these materials will exhibit chemical or physical properties that  may prove as useful as, or more so than, some of the binary  nitrides. The hope is that some materials will exhibit novel  phenomena that will lead to exciting science and perhaps even new  technology.",
