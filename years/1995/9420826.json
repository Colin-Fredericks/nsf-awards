 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of the   research of Dr. Charles Doubleday.  Both computational and time-resolved   experimental studies of the dynamics of bimolecular reactions which have   low or zero enthalpies will be carried out.  Specific computational   studies will  focus on reactions of singlet ethylene and methylene with   ethylene, water and ammonia, as well as the competition between   combination and  disproportionation in the reaction of methyl and ethyl   free radicals. Ab initio calculations of reaction potential curves will   be combined with variational transition state theory to derive reaction   rate constants. Experimentally, picosecond pump-probe spectroscopy of   intramolecular entropy-controlled reactions of biradicals will be   explored. The dependence of the transient decay trace on temperature and   solvent viscosity will be determined.  Entropy-controlled bimolecular reactions such as carbene trapping ,   reaction of ylides with olefins, singlet oxygen trapping, radical   recombination, cycloadditions and excited-state quenching are common in   organic chemistry. This research will advance our understanding, both on   a theoretical and experimental level of the dynamics of these important   processes.",
