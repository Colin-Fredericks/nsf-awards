 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502470  Goel  The primary objective of this  project is to develop an innovative  composite structural system  utilizing open web steel joists  encased in advanced fiber  reinforced concrete materials for  improved economy and performance  for seismic resistance.  Analysis  and practical design procedures  will be formulated.    It is widely recognized that  innovative uses of two or more  different materials generally leads  to more efficient systems for  resisting seismic forces.  Recent  studies show that structural  systems consisting of composite  members made of open web steel  joists encased in fiber reinforced  concrete hold great promise,  especially for seismic resistance.  In such members composite action is  achieved through interlocking  effect between concrete and open  web steel joists without shear  connectors, and the use of fiber  reinforced concrete eliminates the  need for conventional reinforcement  which is quite labor intensive.  Connections are made through steel  plates sticking out of the encasing  concrete.  Therefore, this system  can be suitable for cast-in-place  as well as precast concrete.    The research will begin by testing  half to one-third scale beam-column  specimens under combined axial load  and reversed cyclic bending.  The  test results will be  used to  develop analytical models for the  member behavior.  This work will be  followed by analytical studies of  the selected theme structure.  The  last phase will include testing and  analytical work on critical  subassemblages taken from the theme  structure.  The focus will be on  study of beam-to-column connections  behavior and development of  recommendations for connection  details in order to achieve desired  performance.    This is a project supported under  the year 1 program of the Civil  Infrastructure Systems (CIS)  solicitation NSF 94-154.  ***",
