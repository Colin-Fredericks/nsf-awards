 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502154  Carey       The investigator is studying operator algebras.  More  specifically, he is studying what are known as Steinberg symbols,  a generalization of multiplicative commutators in such algebras.  Steinberg symbols are factored by means of a Koszul complex  construction, and this gives rise to a new invariant, the joint  torsion.  This invariant is related to a local or maximal ideal  index in the setting of commutative operator algebras, and it  provides new understanding of the principal function in the non-  commutative case.  Similar constructions involving higher algebraic  K-groups will also be investigated.       The study of Wiener-Hopf integral equations began more than  sixty years ago in connection with physical problems such as the  diffraction of electromagnetic or sound waves.  A natural operator  W arises.  The investigator's contributions began with the  introduction of a naturally paired operator U for which a  combination of the two operators known as the determinant took on  a particularly simple and useful integral form.  Using this  determinant, he found that the study of the Wiener-Hopf operator W  could be deepened, that new solutions could be found to the  original integral equations, and that the study of functions h(W,U)  of the pair of operators could be put into a new geometric context.   This was an early step in development of the hugely successful new  area of modern mathematics sometimes known as \"non-commutative  geometry.\"  Now non-commutative geometry has drawn together several  diverse areas of mathematics, and \"algebraic K-theory\" figures  prominently among them.  In the context of algebraic K-theory, the  further analysis of the structure of the determinants mentioned  above has led to a new object called the joint torsion of the pair  {W,U}.  This object in turn is linked to geometry in still another  way and occurs in the study of differential equations and in the  study of dynamical systems.  ***",
