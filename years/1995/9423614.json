 "awd_abstract_narration": "Will democracy survive and flourish in Russia?  Perhaps no question in   contemporary politics is as important as the fate of Russian democracy.    To the extent that democracy is consolidated in Russia, world politics is   likely to be more peaceful, more humane, and less costly.     In addition to the strategic importance of this question, the transformation   of Russia raises important scientific questions.  What factors contribute to   the consolidation of democratic transformations, and how are these likely    to change in the near future?  What role do ordinary people (in contrast to   elites) play in the processes of change?  To what degree do Russian   citizens support democratic institutions and processes; to what degree are   they willing to trade freedom and liberty for security and economic   prosperity?  What factors contribute to the development of political   tolerance--a crucial ingredient of democracy--and how might tolerance be   fostered?  To what extent does the existence of distinctive subcultures   within a society make the development of democratic institutions and   processes more difficult?  Change in Russia produces a veritable   laboratory for the analysis of democratization  processes.    This project seeks answers to these questions.  In particular,  the project   extends existing research on the political culture of Russia through a new   survey on the opinions of ordinary citizens.  In conjunction with earlier   surveys, analysis of changes in Russian culture will be conducted.  On the   basis of both longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis, the project will   attempt to predict the likelihood of a democratic consolidation in Russia.    Ultimately, the project seeks to contribute to theories of democratization   by focusing on the all-important case of Russia.",
