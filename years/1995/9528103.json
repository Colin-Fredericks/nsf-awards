The IETF activities are an outgrowth of efforts  started by the US Government during the late 1970s to manage the  evolution of the Internet.  Under a Cooperative Agreement with the  National Science Foundation, the Corporation for National Research  Initiatives created and provided a functioning IETF Secretariat,  and has been helping to organize and support these activities which  involve thousands of individual participants and contributors from  the US and abroad.    To ensure the continued evolution of the Internet and its  contribution to the emerging NII, CNRI proposes to provide the IETF  Secretariat for a period of three years.  The continuation of the  Secretariat with US Government funding will provide stability and  continuity to the IETF during important transitions of the Internet  involving significant architectural change and increased commercial  activity.    CNRI also proposes to create a Planning Group, inclose consultation  with the Government and the IESG (IETF Steering Group), to develop  a plan for generating long-term IETF Secretariat funding.",
