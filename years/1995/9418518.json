 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418518  Metaxas      This award will support expenses to enable Dr. Panagiotis Metaxas  from the Computer Science Department at Wellesley College to  travel to Australia, once each year over a two year period,  to conduct cooperative research with Dr. Adonios Symvonis of the  Basser Department of Computer Science at the University of  Sydney.  The study will focus on the development of an  interactive system for visualizing the execution of graph  algorithms to be entitled \"GraVis\".    Existing visualization systems do not allow user interaction in   any significant manner.  The systems are static in the sense  that the users cannot manipulate the observed algorithms without  considerable reprogramming and a thorough knowledge of the  system.  The collaborative activity will be restricted to   graph algorithms. The proposed GraVis system will permit  interactivity in that the user will be able to dynamically  alter both the algorithm and the data to receive visual  feedback from the changes.  The project brings together the  complementary skills of the investigators, the American in the  area of visualization and graph theory and the Australian  with expertise in packet routing algorithms for interconnection  networks.  The visits to Australia will also provide the  opportunity for Dr. Metaxas to establish links with the strong  Australian graph drawing community, an area which is of  considerable importance to scientific visualization.",
