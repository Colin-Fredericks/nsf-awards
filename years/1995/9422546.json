 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of gender inequalities across metropolitan labor markets.  Existing theory suggests that a principal cause promoting gender equality is the growth of women's labor force participation.  Participation rates are themselves consequences of the demand for female labor, especially of the degree to which a labor market has high concentrations of female-dominated occupations.  A high demand for female labor reduces other aspects of gender inequality through market, normative, and political mechanisms.  This research will test the normative linkages by using survey data aggregated to the area level.  The political linkages will be tested with data from Equal Employment Opportunity complaints and from other more general indicators of women's political mobilization.  Testing these ideas requires combining area and individual data into three contextual analyses.  First, area measures of labor demand, norms, mobilization, and occupation will be related to the size of the gender coefficient in a standard earnings function predicting hourly wages.  Second, the demand, normative, and political contexts will be related to the gender composition of a worker's occupation.  Third, a standard labor supply analysis will be extended to include a measure of the occupational composition of the area's labor force.  A final analysis will summarize all the contextual relationships within a single framework with areas rather than individuals as the unit of analysis.  %%%   This research differs from earlier work on gender differences in the rewards to human capital by emphasizing the role played by the economic, social, and political environment in which women find themselves.  Only some of the progress towards gender equality that we have witnessed in recent years can be understood as the result of the changing characteristics of individual women.  This project will systematically examine how differences in labor markets, normative climate, and political mobilization might explain more of the variation in  gender equality than do studies based on individuals alone.  Thus it will strengthen our understanding of socio-political factors that shape the rewards men and women receive for the human capital they possess.",
