The service is being  used to explore applications for ATM services with unpredictable  (no-guarantees) Quality Of Service (QOS).  An initial contribution  was submitted to the Enterprise Network Roundtable (ENR) user group  of the ATM Forum describing the feasibility of a video multicast  application over Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) services.  Our  contribution proposes to implement a new, optional and selective  multilevel Forward Error Correction (FEC) method in the application  layer based on information priority levels versus having a fixed  FEC implementation in the lower layers.       Preliminary research has consisted in software simulation and  initial implementations of PET systems using deterministic  algorithms like polynomial and linear independent equations over  finite fields.  These algorithms are quadratic in complexity and  the message-size/packet-size ratio limits its application to  recovering IP packet losses only.        Proposed work includes: 1) exploring firmware implementations  and the use of probabilistic algorithms to achieve faster software  implementations required to recover IP packets and ATM cell losses  in real-time MPEG-2 and JPEG video streams, where delay is a key  issue for interactive applications;  2) exploring mechanisms based  on user priorities for network routers to discard/filter large  amounts of packets that could cause congestion in low performance  networks and receivers during video multicast transmission by high  performance workstations, 3) realizing performance analysis based  on benchmark studies consisting of tests and measurements done in  heterogeneous wide area network (MBone/Internet/ATM) scenarios; and  4) in collaboration with researchers at UC Berkeley and local  industries, investigating integrating PET systems into specific  applications such as MPEG-2.  ***",
