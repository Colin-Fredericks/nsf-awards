 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504264  Connolly       Connolly will be studying obstructions to topological rigidity  such as those provided by the group UNIL of S. Cappell.  He will be  investigating the problem of fitting a boundary onto a stratified  space with a tame end.  He will also be using these to attack the  Quinn Rigidity Conjecture (ICM, 1986).  He wishes to take the new  \"continuous control\" K-theory and use it to create a Surgery theory  which is adapted to these problems.  He is also including  4-dimensional smooth manifolds in his project (Gauge Theory).       In this project Connolly will be attempting to show that:  Arithmetic Groups are Topologically Rigid.  In less epigrammatic  terms, this means that the extreme symmetry exhibited by some of  the fundamental geometries of nature (these geometries are called  Locally Symmetric Spaces by mathematicians and physicists), should  eventually be shown to be based on purely topological properties of  their fundamental groups.  In highly oversimplified terms, it means  that anything that is vaguely like a torus (or a Klein bottle)  should be topologically equivalent to a torus (or a Klein bottle).  An example of a topological equivalence is given by a circle and  ellipse; they are not congruent figures in the sense of Euclidean  geometry, but they are topologically equivalent, because a little  stretching of the one produces the other.  ***",
