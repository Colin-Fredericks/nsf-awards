 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500878  Slaman       Slaman intends to study computability and mathematical definability.  This research will contribute to developing a complete understanding of   the degree-theoretic structures associated with relative definability,  such as the global structures of the Turing degrees D and the Turing   degrees of the recursively enumerable sets R.  Missing ingredients   necessary to this understanding include determining whether the   universal-existential theory of R is decidable, characterizing when a   relation on R or D is definable within that structure, and  calculating the automorphism groups of these structures.  Secondly,   Slaman plans contributions to the proof-theoretic understanding of   second-order arithmetic.  In that context, one considers formal axiom   systems which postulate that the universe (of sets or of reals) is   closed under definable operations.  For example, one considers the   collection of axioms that states that the reals are closed under   relative computation of arithmetic definability.  Slaman plans   systematically to study the combinatorial set-theoretic properties of the   continuum in this context.  He is particularly interested in   conservation questions: When do closure properties of the continuum   have nontrivial consequences for first-order number theory?       The algebraic structure of definability is well represented by the  Turing degrees, a classification of sets of integers in which two sets   that can be computed from each other are considered equivalent.  Slaman   will study the Turing degrees in several settings, to address fundamental   questions about their critical features.  The necessity of noneffective   means, such as the existence of sets which are not computable, can also be   demonstrated proof-theoretically; this motivates Slaman's program for the   systematic investigation of the combinatorial set-theoretic properties of   the continuum (i.e., of an infinite set of size equal to that of all real   numbers).  He is particularl y interested in questions which relate the set   theory of the continuum to other important sets.  When do certain properties   of the continuum have bearing on elementary properties of the integers?  ***",
