The metastable states were   studied previously based on the physical level only. It seems   now that there are ways to treat these intermediate states of random   systems rigorously. Concerning the escape time, it is  planned to work   on proving the Aizenman-Lebowitz conjecture, which relates the time in   question with the energy the system needs to create a droplet of   critical size, which droplet then grows and covers the whole space. A   related question is the shape of the critical droplet, and the   aim here is to show that it is given by the Wulff construction.       The research is centered around the questions arising in the field of   systems with random evolution. Such questions are relevant for our   understanding of the results of computer simulations of complex   models.  The questions here are two-fold:  the typical behavior of   the systems in question before they have time to equilibrate, and how   long this equilibration time really is. The hope to answer to both of   the questions for certain systems.  ***",
