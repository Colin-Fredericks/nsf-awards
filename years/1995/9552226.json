 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the Botany Department is microscaling the  labs of upper-division courses that feature analytical  biochemistry as a key component of the lab assignments.   This  project mostly affects Plant Physiology, but Plant Genetics,  Plant Growth and Development, and a newly approved thesis program  for botany majors also benefit.   These courses serve mainly  botany majors and biology teaching majors.    Performing labs on  a microscale, rather than a conventional scale, allows the Botany  Department to address several problems.    The cost of reagents  on a conventional scale is prohibitive; microscale labs reduce  the amount of chemical waste generated.   Student lab technique  improves, as students are more careful when handling chemicals in  small amounts rather than in large quantities.   Finally,  microscale labs can be completed more quickly than full-scale  ones, allowing students to analyze and interpret, not just  collect, their data while they are still in class.   This project  funds the purchase of a microtiter plate reader with supporting  computer hardware and software for data collection and analysis.    The plate reader is used in place of a spectrophotometer for  microscale labs.   The plate reader also gives students the  opportunity to use computer-interfaced laboratory equipment.    This project also shows application of the microscale approach in  a subject area other than organic or inorganic chemistry.",
