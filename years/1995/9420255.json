 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anderson    Under the direction of Dr. Douglas Anderson, Mr. Brian Robinson  will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will obtain  radiocarbon dates on materials associated with 33 Moorehead  burial tradition sites from coastal locations in Maine. While the  existence of this tradition has been known for many years and it  has been determined that sites range from ca. 8,500 to 3,700 B.P.  most individual occurrences are very poorly dated. Mr. Robinson  has discovered that materials at many of these sites include  small amounts of charcoal; therefore the AMS technique will allow  their age to be determined.     The Moorehead tradition is known for its elaborate red ocher  human burials which are grouped into clearly defined cemeteries.  Archaeologists have focussed attention on this phenomenon because  such a degree of elaboration is rare among hunters and gathers  and suggests complex levels of social organization among this  Archaic period people. Mr. Robinson believes that he can use the  geographical distribution of cemeteries and their relationships  both to each other and to important natural resources to  reconstruct both social and ecological aspects of this tradition  and to determine how these changed over time. However to conduct  such an analysis it is necessary to obtain chronological control  over individual sites and this research will accomplish this.    This work is important for several reasons. It will increase our  understanding of how peoples at a simple level of cultural  organization adapted to their social and natural environment. It  will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and will  assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
