 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410501  Stahl  This research will develop an alternative  theory of  strategic thinking that would allow for a population of  players with a variety of thought processes, would be  empirically testable, and would yield more accurate  predictions of human behavior. The analysis of the  experimental data is expected to answer the following  questions, among others:       - How well does the model predict relative to  alternative theories?       - How robust is the determination of the type of a  specific player         from that player's choices? Is the tpye of  identification invariant         over a variety and number of games, and is it valid  for predicting         out-of-sample behavior?       - Can extra-ordinary subjects be detected?       - Assuming that players are given complete information  about the past         choices of the population, is it reasonable to assume  that the         various types would incorporate that information?  The study is significant because it provides results that  would enrich our understanding of individual decision making  in strategic settings.",
