The  goal of CAPS is to develop the scientific basis for the improvement of short term  forecasts (less than 24 hours) of severe convective weather.        The purpose of this project from the Colorado State University is to work in   conjunction with CAPS scientists to produce high-quality, gridded analyses from the   Oklahoma adaptation of the local area prediction system developed by the National   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  These gridded analyses will be used by  CAPS scientists in diagnostic studies of convective phenomena; as background fields  for high-resolution Doppler-retrieval procedures; as initial conditions for  high-resolution numerical models and four-dimensional data assimilation procedures  in order to test the capabilities of the CAPS Advanced Regional Prediction System.   Additionally, these gridded analyses will be used by a variety of scientists in the  study of severe weather.  ***",
