 "awd_abstract_narration": "Persistent programming languages provide a simple mechanism to  make data persistent without the impedance mismatch that occurs  when storing  data in a database.  As a result, persistent  programming languages greatly  facilitate the development of  software that uses persistent data. A serious  problem exists when  maintaining programs written in persistent programming  languages.  The storage format for persistent data is derived from the  structural representation of the data's type as defined in the  program. When  the representation is changed, the software is no  longer able to access  existing persistent data.    This research addresses the problems of type  evolution .  It is  developing algorithms to recognize complex type changes, to  assist the software  engineer in assuring that persistent data  conform to modified semantics of the  software, and to assist in  identifying and updating code affected by structural  changes to a  type. The approach relies on persistent types defined as abstract  data types. Type changes are identified by comparing the  interfaces to the  types, the structural representations of the  types, and constraints attached to  the types. The algorithms are  being incorporated into a tool that provides  computer-aided type  evolution support. The primary goal of the tool is to  manage the  complexity of type evolution and provide assurance that evolution  issues are addressed by the software engineer while not  restricting the ways in  which the software engineer modifies  type definitions.  A secondary goal is to  automate data evolution  for a collection of well-understood type changes. The  combination  of flexibility, automation, and concern with semantic issues  is expected to provide advances over existing type evolution support  systems.  Experimentation is using histories collected from the  development of real  systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms.",
