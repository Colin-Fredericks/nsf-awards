 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Seattle Community College seeks funding from NSF's  Advanced Technological Education program to make major improvements  in electronics and engineering technologies curricula By  collaborating with industry, professional associations,  institutions of higher education, and secondary schools, the  college proposes to develop model ATE programs that raises  standards and performance levels for technicians in industrial  applications.  Since its opening in 1970, the college has offered  comprehensive electronics and engineering technologies programs,  along with technical specializations in biomedical technology, CAD  for industrial applications, industrial power control,  communications technology, digital computer electronics, and  computer networking.  To comply with the new standards developed  for technicians by the American Electronics Association designed to  raise skill and knowledge levels, faculty propose significant  changes in the college's approach to technological education.   Spanning a period of five years, 1995-2000, the project focuses on  three major components:         (1)  Faculty Development.  A rigormus faculty enhancement       program is planned to prepare faculty for curricular reform.       Participants in a summer institute in 1996 and 1997 will       include electronics and engineering faculty, secondary school       teachers, and representatives of industry.  Building a       foundation for preparing technical workers, the institute will       cover a range of topics that include AEA standards, industry       practices, collaborative approaches to teaching, use of       interactive courseware, and competency-based instruction.  The       professional enhancement program also promotes faculty's       return to industry for updating their knowledge and skills.       (2) Curriculum and Instructional Materials.  Comprehensive       curricular reform requires development of Tech Prep career       pathways in electronics and engineering technologies with       Sea ttle Public Schools, pre-college level workshops in applied       academics for students deficient in basic skills, integration       of science and mathematics into technical programs, and new       and revised curricula in electronics and engineering.        Included in the project is faculty's collaboration with       industry on training modules that can be used in the classroom       as well as at the work site.  These modules will focus on       basic skills and on specific, typically complex technical       topics such as object-oriented design and documentation.        Faculty will also coordinate curricula for improving       articulation between two- and four-year institutions and for       establishing new degree options for NSCC's students.         (3) Laboratory Improvement.  Over the five-year period,       faculty will integrate into the curriculum a new learning       laboratory where automated work environments can be simulated       and state-of-the-art systems demonstrated.  The integrated       systems laboratory will be designed to provide students with       an overview of systems involved in taking a product from       design and pattern layout to a tested and finished product.",
