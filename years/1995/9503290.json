The investigator and his colleagues propose to investigate some of the probabilistic and analytical properties of this process. This process locally exhibits many features of the solutions to a class of stochastic partial differential equations. As such, our proposed analysis would have ramifications in the study of hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations. Also considered will be the properties of the graph of the Brownian sheet viewed as a non-smooth random surface.  The problems of interest include certain questions involving transport problems on some random erratic fractures and surfaces. Idealized versions of such objects appear in recent investigations in the engineering and  physics literature.    The proposed research involves a systematic study of a class of random processes which arise in several areas of mathematics as well as in physics and engineering. Such problems include but are not limited to transport problems, wave phenomena and turbulence. The underlying common theme in many such problems is a mathematical object called the Brownian sheet.  With only a few exceptions, the geometry of the Brownian sheet is a largely unexplored area; primarily due to the fact that there are not many general methods for its study. Among other works, it is the goal of this proposal to make some attempts at remedying this situation.",
