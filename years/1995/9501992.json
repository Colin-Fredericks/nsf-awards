 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Christopher C.  Cummins, Chemistry Department, Massachusetts   Institute of Technology, is supported by the Inorganic,  Bioinorganic,   and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division under a   Faculty Early Career Advancement Award to study radical bond-forming   reactions of inorganic compounds and to contribute to several aspects of   the MIT teaching program. A major portion of the research is directed   toward the design and synthesis of new metal complexes that will undergo   clean radical reactions with a variety of inorganic substrates. Examples   include Ti(III)-amido species which will react with early   transition-metal oxo-complexes to yield heterometallic bridging oxo   compounds and with nitrido complexes to form metal-nitrogen-metal units.   The teaching plan  has several goals including the design of a new course   in inorganic chemistry which is based on Nobel Lectures, the institution   of an informal seminar series, and service as an undergraduate academic   advisor.  In many chemical compounds each electron is paired with another. In some,   however, this pairing is not complete and compounds which contain one or   more unpaired electrons are called `radicals`. While radicals are known   to be very reactive, they have not been extensively explored as   precursors for inorganic substances. The purpose of this study is to   prepare stable metal containing radicals and utilize them to develop new   routes to important classes of inorganic compounds. The teaching portion   of the project is designed to improve the effectiveness of the chemical   education program, mostly in inorganic chemistry, at MIT.",
