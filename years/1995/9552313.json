Students from science and  nonscience curricula have been conducting exercises to learn more  about genes and their expression through the genetic  transformation of E. coli with plasmids containing the genes that  are responsible for bioluminescence.  When transformed colonies  are observed in a darkened room, their bioluminescent glow  elicits \"wows\" and \"oohs\" from observers, adding to the  excitement associated with learning about new biotechnologies.   Each year the project affects approximately 2500 college students  including 150-200 preservice teachers.  Additionally, each year  48 precollege students (grades 8-12) and their science teachers  are exposed to the aforementioned experiments.  Through this  project, sufficient equipment is funded to continue the current  transformation experiment and to reduce team sizes such that all  students are able to get \"hands-on\" experience.  In addition,  implementation of additional exercises in restriction  endonuclease digestion, gel electrophoresis, and gene regulation  is possible.",
