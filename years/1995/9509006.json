 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509006  Holsinger    Much progress has been made in understanding the evolution of plant mating systems since Thomas Knight proposed in 1799 that \"No plant fertilizes itself for a perpetuity of generations.\".  In these two centuries, however, most studies have shared one significant feature with Knight's work--an emphasis on the fitness consequences of inbreeding.  To botanists inbreeding depression is an obstacle that must be overcome; to geneticists it is the only force that can oppose the otherwise certain spread of a selfing allele.  As a result, experimental and theoretical analyses of inbreeding depression have dominated the study of plant mating systems for many years.    The mass-action model recently developed by Dr. Holsinger shows that the dynamics of pollen transfer may have an impact on the evolutionary dynamics of plant mating systems as great as that of inbreeding depression, and it shows considerable promise as a comprehensive framework for analyzing the impact of individual differences in pollen transfer dynamics.  It is also the only approach in which mixed mating systems are evolutionarily stable for a broad range of parameter values, unless the range of possible selfing rates is constrained.  The work proposed here will extend existing mass-action models in ways that allow determination of which aspects of the reproductive process have the greatest impact on the evolutionary dynamics of plant mating systems.",
