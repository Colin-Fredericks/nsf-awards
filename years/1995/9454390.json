Sixty leader teachers, from grades seven through nine,  will participate in a series of two six-day academies each summer,  a three day winter short course and ten follow-up meetings during  the academic year. Workshop content and pedagogy will be merged so  that teachers will learn in a format that their students are  expected to use. The science content will be guided by local needs,  national science education reform efforts and the emerging NRC  standards. Reflecting its comprehensive nature these teachers will  also learn assessment techniques, applications of technology and  leadership skills and strategies. Other middle and  high school  science teachers in the participating districts will be included in  the project through intensive workshop experiences lasting one  hundred and five hours. These second tier workshops sill be  conducted by the leader teachers. The Anchorage School District  will be the lead district. The extraordinary contrast between urban  centers and road-accessible remote rural communities will be  alleviated by partnering the resources of each using electronic  networks.",
