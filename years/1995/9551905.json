These problems have contributed to  students in Human Physiology laboratories becoming observers,  rather than active participants in laboratory experiments.  The  goal of this project is to provide more investigative and  cooperative learning experiences for students by: 1) restructuring  the curriculum to foster inquiry and teamwork; and 2) equipping  them with computer controlled data acquisition technology.   Students are learning science and critical thinking by actively  participating in hands-on laboratory exercises, working in small  groups to gather data, using computers to analyze the data, and  discussing and presenting their findings.    Computer workstations with accompanying data acquisition hardware  and software, and a computer network are being employed to  accomplish these goals.  In restructuring the curriculum to include  the new equipment, care is being taken to design a user-friendly  environment that encourages teamwork and active learning,  especially for under prepared students lacking a technological  background.  A thorough critique of this project and the results of  its evaluation will be presented and published nationally.",
