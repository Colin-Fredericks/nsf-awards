Lansing, MI 48824   Project Abstract  During the past few years, the investigator and  his colleagues have achieved significant progress in the  modeling, analysis, and computation of superconducting phenomena.  The proposed work of the   investigator and his collaborators  includes the further development and refinement of their previous  work on mezoscale models (in particular, the Ginzburg-Landau  model and its variants), as well as new computational and  analytical explorations into the macroscale (homogenized) models.  At the mezoscale level, the investigator continues the  development and implementation of efficient algorithms for  treating a variety of interesting phenomena involving the motion  of vortices in type-II superconductors, especially the high  critical temperature layered superconductors. At the macroscale,  the investigator proposes to develop enhancements of existing  models that can account for inhomogenieties and for applied  currents and voltages and to develop and implement discretization  and solution algorithms for determining approximate solutions for  these models. The types of phenomena the investigator and his  colleagues wish to simulate include vortex liquid and vortex  glass structures, pinning by normal impurities and thickness  variations, motion and de-pinning due to  thermal fluctuations  and applied currents and voltages, resistivity caused by motion,  and critical currents.      Superconductivity is one of the grand  challenges identified as being crucial to future economic  prosperity and scientific leadership. With the advent of modern  computational technology, scientists, engineers, and  mathematicians who wish to design superconducting devices and/or  who wish to study the physics of superconductivity are in need  robust and efficient algorithms and codes for the numerical  simulation of superconduc ting phenomena. The investigator and his  colleagues are aimed at meeting such a need. Useful tools will be  developed not only for the use of physicists and material  scientists interested in studying superconducting phenomena at  the vortex level, but also for those involved in the design of  superconducting devices.",
