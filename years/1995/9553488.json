 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553488  Heber    This pilot after-school program at Chabot Observatory & Science Center seeks to involve and  excite adolescent girls about science, through astronomy-related activities, including their own  research and production of a new planetarium program about women's contributions to the field.   Dissemination is to include distribution of the planetarium show product, sharing information  about the project process with other education organizations, and a teacher enhancement program  to foster replication elsewhere.  The concept for this project came from teachers of science who  have expertise in astronomy.  They saw an opportunity to combine an existing, but modest,  volunteer program with a broader effort serving the community.      This project targets middle and high school girls at the point in their schooling where an interest  in science and related careers is most vulnerable to negative influences.  It involves them in an  innovative and creative project, honoring the contributions of women in science, and shedding  light on the skills which fostered those contributions, while developing in participants the very  skills which can influence their own career opportunities.  In this project, both the product--the  planetarium show and video, and the process--skill development as a means to the end product,  are equally important and encouraged.  After completion, the 40 girls and two teachers directly  trained will offer a model to thousands of others who can use active learning to tell their own  stories of scientific achievement.  ***",
