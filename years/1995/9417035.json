 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417035  Etzel    Post main-sequence stars, having exhausted the hydrogen fuel in their  core, undergo core contraction, thermonuclear ignition of hydrogen in a  thin shell, and expansion of their outer layers.  When such a star is  in a close binary system, evolutionary expansion causes it to fill its  so-called Roche surface, a tear-dropped shaped lobe with a cusp pointed  at the other star.  Matter flows along the surface of this star (the  \"loser\"), through the cusp (where the gravitational forces are equal),  and is collimated in a stream that sends mass to the other star (the  \"gainer\").  This evolution by mass exchange occurs on a time scale of  one million to ten million years, some 100 to 1000 times faster than  the rate of evolution when the star is on the main sequence path of  stellar evolution.    Nature has conspired to make the details of mass flows and accretion  processes especially observable in Algol-type binary star systems.   Research on these systems will improve our physical understanding of  these processes.   The research effort will be concentrated on studying   long-period Algol systems in which the transferred mass supplies a  flattened accretion disk rotating around the \"gainer\".   The viscous  dissipation in the disk allows matter to spiral inward to be accreted  by the \"gainer\", supplying mass and angular momentum to that star.  The  mass, structure, composition, viscous heating, and instabilities of  accretion disks will be studied using the strong hydrogen-alpha  wavelength emission lines and infrared wavelength absorption lines of  oxygen produced in these disks.  A diagnostic model to predict line  profiles will be developed.  The orbits of binary star systems are  viewed nearly edge-on, so the stars eclipse each other. The \"losers\"  also partially eclipse the disks, and the disks partially eclipse  losers, adding greatly to the observed spatial resolution of the  images.  Multi-color photometry of the stellar light variations and  spectroscopic observations of  stellar radial velocities will provide  data to calculate stellar masses and radii, which will set the  gravitation stratification in the accretion disks.     Equatorial accretion of matter from the disk onto the \"gainer\" leads to  rapid rotation of that star. Unless the angular momentum transport to  the star is very efficient, the surface rotation of the \"gainer\" should  be differential.  The detection of the differential rotation will be  sought by observing spectral line profiles as eclipses of the gainer  proceed and various portions of the stellar surface are eclipsed or  exposed.  Results from using other techniques that gauge the average  rotation of the stellar envelope, will be combined with the  differential rotation data to shed light on the ultimate mass and  angular momentum assimilation by \"gainers\".    Estimates of the rate of mass transfer in some systems will be made.   It will be possible to judge critically from photometric solutions  whether \"losers\" truly fill their Roche surfaces.  In a significant  number of cases, the Roche volumes are not filled.  Some mechanism  other than simple lobe overflow must therefore drive mass transfer and  evolution in these systems.  Magnetic activity on \"loser\" surfaces, and  cool stars in related systems, will be studied.",
