 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last decade, McLean Hospital, affiliated with the Harvard Medical School, has been one of the world's most productive sites for neuroscience research.  For the most part, laboratory research at McLean is done at the Mailman Research Center (MRC).  Constructed in 1945, the MRC currently provides laboratory support and space for 24 investigators, 26 post-doctoral students, 7 graduate students and additional undergraduate and graduate students during the summer.  At present, neuroscience research is performed in the Biological Research Laboratory facility.  Researchers engage in programs of related projects studying the cytostructural elements essential for normal neuronal growth and development and signal transduction mechanisms mediating neuronal plasticity in development and aging.  However,  due to its antiquated support facilities, coupled with significant building code modifications and requirements, the facility no longer provides adequate laboratory space.  Infrastructure utilities, including HVAC, electrical, plumbing, water filtration, and acid neutralization systems are in desperate need of replacement. High technology instrumentation and techniques required to conduct many of the extremely complex analytical tasks cannot be sustained in the presently configured space.   This award will provide partial funding for the replacement of the Biological Research Laboratory.  Upon completion, modernized research space will be available to support investigations in neurodevelopmental, molecular and structural neuroscience.  The research programs will benefit by an improved infrastructure that will be capable of supporting advanced techniques and by  furnishing  a clean environment required for operating the instrumentation utilizing these techniques.  This renovation project will provide the neuroscience program with a laboratory environment designed to complement modern research procedures required to meet high technology research protocols.",
