 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college is integrating cell culture techniques into  functional biology laboratory curricula by developing a tissue  culture facility.   The introduction of these techniques is vital  to improving student comprehension of lecture material through  hands-on laboratory experiences.   Course work affected includes  Immunology, Cell Biology, and Developmental Biology; in addition,  the equipment enables students to perform a wide variety of  senior research projects in these areas.   The college's goal is  to provide in vitro models designed to enhance biology students'  understanding of immunity, cell physiology/biology, and molecular  biology.   A thorough understanding of these areas is critical  for undergraduates pursuing medical and research careers.   The  major equipment obtained through this project includes a laminar  flow hood, a climate controlled (CO2) incubator, a refrigerated  table-top centrifuge, a microplate reader, and an inverted  microscope.",
