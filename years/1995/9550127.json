 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550127  Bollwinkel    The University of Northern Iowa, the Geographic Alliance of Iowa,  and the Environmental Issues Instruction (eii) program, in  conjunction with the Iowa State Department of Education will 1)  develop a structure for involved personnel, 2) establish evidence  of broad support, 3) form a list of consultant resources, 4)  evaluate curricular assumptions, and 5) outline a development and  institutionalization plan.  Once these activities are done, they  will develop and submit proposals for support to implement their  plan.    To accomplish their goals, they will develop both a steering  committee (6 members) and a planning committee (17 members) drawn  from a broad base of partners (formal, informal, and general  public), identify stakeholders, and evaluate various assumptions  they have about developing a global change curriculum model,  activate participation in a communication network, outline a plan  for training trainers, and establish a list of consultants.  The  results of this work will be dissemination by means of the network  of approximately 1000 teachers trained in environmental issues.    Cost sharing is $6500 (%) and comes from funds and in-kind  contributions made by the Geographic Alliance of Iowa and the  University of Northern Iowa.",
