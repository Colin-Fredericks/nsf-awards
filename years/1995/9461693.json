 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes the development of a rapid prototyping system addressing the needs of both designers and manufactures. An effective rapid prototyping system is capable of producing components suitable for the testing of both form and function. By testing components early in the design phase dimensional errors as well as structural deficiencies may be identified and corrected. The ability to transition rapidly from prototyping to production can also dramatically reduce time it takes to introduce new products to market. Research efforts to date have focused on either the needs of the designers or manufactures. This novel proposal describes an interactive rapid prototyping approach, called Direct Rapid Prototyping and Process Generation, that allows for the rapid realization of prototype components from their CAD descriptions with the simultaneous generation of a CNC tool path program and process plan. Using a joy stick a machinist can direct a CNC machine tool controller to accurate|y machine a prototype component. Process data generated during this interactive machining cycle is then used to create an idealize part program for use by a subsequent production cycle.",
