 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research will examine sources of conflict and dynamics of change in international species protection policy, by examining Project Tiger, an effort to save the Bengal tiger by the government of India, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the World Conservation Union (IUCN), and a cadre of wildlife biologists and ecologists from India, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Species Survival Commission (SSC).  The award will allow the dissertation student to spend eight months in India collecting administrative, archival and interview information from three Project Tiger sanctuaries.  The early 1970s saw the exclusion of villagers from new tiger sanctuaries, a policy consistent with the views of many ecologists and with established forestry policy in India.  This strategy caused conflict among the groups that make preservation policy as well as between villagers, park wardens, and tigers.  Over time, the policy was reevaluated and new strategies and policies have emerged.  This research uses a logic of rule analysis in conjunction with an issue-processing approach to understand the dynamics of policy change.  It sees policy failure as the result of conflict over principles, with the desire to resolve conflict providing a catalyst to change the principles so as to allow changes in policies and institutions.  The project identifies and examines situations where rules conflict and then change so as to allow resolutions to develop.  It provides a picture of a stage by stage process where changes in the description of a problem and the solutions to that problem can be identified and tracked, helping to identify not only the shifts in policy but also the locations where changes in institutions might be expected to occur.  Understanding these dynamics can challenge or support theoretical perspectives, illuminate the relationships between the state and society in the context of policy change, increase understanding of the role of scientific advisors in policy reformulation, and advance knowledge of institutional change.",
