The long-term goal for the three phases is to determine the sustainability of various natural or semi-natural land uses on tropical sites of differing soil quality and topography. Sustainability is defined as land use in which rates of nutrient and soil mass loss are less than rates of nutrient input and soil formation. This is important because of increasing conversion of species rich forests to agricultural land throughout the tpopics. in many tropical areas, agriculture is typically short-lived, and fields are then abandoned. Abandoned fields and tropical moist forest tend to have negative and positive net soil mass and nutrient balances, respectively. Thus, at the landscape scale, forests can offset losses from adjacent fields. Therefore, landscape scale sustainability requires restoration and regeneration of natural forest vegetation. The near-term goal of this project is to document patterns of abandoned pasture succession, and identify factors potentially limiting the rate of forest regeneration. To do so, rates of succession on different soil types and conditions will be quantified, and seed rain, seed bank, seed germination, seedling establishment and sapling growth will be measured. These factors will be combined to understand limitations to colonization and growth of species for the restoration of tropical forest communities.    Given the rapidly increasing rates of deforestation and population growth in many tropical areas, the ability to rapidly restore vegetation to abandoned cropland becomes increasingly important. This study will provide valuable population-level data at the landscape scale to guide experimental approaches to large-scale restoration of abandoned agricultural land in the tropics.",
