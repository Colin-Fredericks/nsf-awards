 "awd_abstract_narration": "Corbett  9510278    Synthetic explorations will be pursued for novel materials  among the metal-rich halides and chalcogenides of the early  transition metals and the physical characterization of these  materials. The studies will feature the unique group of  highly reduced compounds in which metal cluster and  condensed cluster phases are stabilized by strongly bound,  interstitial elements. The cluster hosts will include  scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides, the halides will be  chlorine, bromine and iodine, the chalcogenides sulfur,  selenium and tellurium. The interstitials in halides will  feature the transition metals. Further characterization of  the apparently metallic lanthanides-based compounds and of  the nature of their electronic and magnetic transitions will  be emphasized together with searches for other phases  showing unusual properties and new structures and bonding.  Physical properties of interesting phases will be defined by  crystal structure, conductivity, magnetic susceptibility,  and photoelectron spectroscopic measurements and augmented  by extended-Huckel (band) calculations. Particular emphasis  will be given to the nature of the bonding and the physical  properties and to new horizons in solid state chemistry.  %%%  The need for new materials is well recognized. The long  range objectives of the present program are to expand the  boundaries of what is possible in the solid state, to  understand and conceptualize the results as to stability,  structure, bonding and properties and, ultimately, to  provide sufficient information and experience to allow some  systemization and reasonable predictions. Several new and  exciting directions are proposed. The new emphases include  binary, ternary and quaternary (interstitial) compounds of  lanthanum, an element that has been investigated very little  but which appears to exhibit some distinctive and remarkable  compounds  ***",
