 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413040  Wake, D. B.  The Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California  at Berkeley, has operated the Hastings Natural History  Reservation since 1937.  Hastings is located in the Santa  Lucia Mountains, a coastal mountain range in central  California.  Over 900 ha of the natural community mosaic is  protected for research and teaching use.  Hastings supports  many ongoing research projects; in 1994 Hastings will  provide housing and facilities for about 40 field studies.  In 1989, funding from NSF provided a modern laboratory  space.  Recent private donations, support from NSF, from the  Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and the Berkeley campus has  allowed significant upgrading of Hastings' facilities.  Housing for 34 researchers has been added or renovated since  1988.  A new domestic water storage, treatment and  distribution system has been installed.  Over the past six  years, use at Hastings has increased dramatically and  reached maximum seasonal use level determined by facility  capacity and an ongoing management plan.  Funding from the  UC-Natural Reserve System allowed purchase of hardware and  software for a geographic information system (GIS)  A GIS at  Hastings will be of great value to our resident and visiting  researchers, neighboring landowners, and the management  staff.    This project will provide for the acquisition of a global  positioning system (GPS) to incorporate existing data on  vertebrate populations and genetics into our GIS.  Other  administrative uses include location of the reserve  boundaries, updated maps of reserve buildings and utilities  and to conduct vegetation and habitat mapping.  A modern GIS  and GPS capability will continue to attract new researchers  and will expand the research and training opportunities for  current investigators.",
