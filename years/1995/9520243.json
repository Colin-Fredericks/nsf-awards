Average Reward Reinforcement Learning    Reinforcement learning is the improvement of performance of an  agent due to rewards and punishments.  Most studies of the  phenomenon so far have assumed that the learning proceeds  through maximizing the discounted total reward from the  environment. Discounting tends to favor the sacrifice of higher  long-term rewards in favor of short-term rewards.  On the other  hand, performance is often better enhanced in real situations  by the use of average reward per unit time.   One such  application is the scheduling of automatic guided vehicles  (AGVs - robots used for material handling tasks in flexible  manufacturing systems), where optimization of discounted total  reward will influence the robots to serve machines that are  close and neglect those far away, leading to stoppage of the  more distant machines, and perhaps to the halting of the entire  manufacturing system.  The objective of this project is to use  the AGV scheduling problem as a means of studying reinforcement  learning methods that optimize average reward to avoid such  pitfalls,  leading to a better understanding of the factors  that influence performance under automated average reward  reinforcement learning.",
