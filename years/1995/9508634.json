These   programs will strengthen the links between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of   doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both academia and industry.   Jose Nathan Kutz received his doctoral degree from Northwestern University and   will work under the direction of Philip Holmes at Princeton and Paul Wright and Pierre   Hohenberg at AT&T. The research will deal with optical fiber technology and nonlinear   wave propagation and pattern formation in spatially extended systems.  The common   mathematical ground linking these areas is the use of nonlinear partial differential   equations in modeling wave and pulse propagation in active and disordered media.  In   particular, equations of nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) and Ginsburg-Landau type   frequently arise.",
