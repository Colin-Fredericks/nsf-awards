 "awd_abstract_narration": "A force concept approach to introductory physics laboratories  seeks to address the lack of conceptual understanding that  students retain as they exit from introductory courses.   The  project hopes to aid students in building operational definitions  for the concept of force and provide them with direct, personal  experience with the measurement of force.   The goal is that each  student (a) learn about physical phenomena in a hands-on way, (b)  overcome conceptual difficulties, (c) learn the procedures  involved in drawing scientific conclusions, (d) experience  working with laboratory equipment including computers, and (e)  use writing and critical thinking as tools to gain understanding.    They use computerized force sensors, motion sensors, and field  sensors to gain direct experience with forces and fields and the  resulting motions of objects subject to these.   The target  audience includes students from biology, prepharmacy,  premedicine, prephysical-therapy, architecture, preservice  teaching, sciences, math, and engineering, including students who  later major in physics.",
