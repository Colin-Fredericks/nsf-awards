This  project will introduce and examine a new paradigm for the  teletraffic analysis of communication networks which is based on a  system theoretic approach that is well rooted in the field of  control theory.  This approach has the following features:       1) it is based on a dynamical system viewpoint for the  workload distribution in the system;  2) it provides both exact  solution and approximate solution (with less computational effort);    3) it is unifying in the sense that the method is capable of  solving most of the proposed teletraffic models in a unique and  simple framework, including fluid flow approximations, queues fed  with different correlated and bursty arrivals, general Markov  chains of M/G/1 or G/M/1 type, etc.;  4) the method can be viewed  as a \"bridge\" between the matrix analytic methods and spectral  decomposition techniques where it avoids the need for a large  number of iterations (especially in heavy traffic) encountered in  the methods of the former type and the ill-conditioned root finding  problem (especially when individual source characterization is  complex) of the problems of the latter type;  5) the method can be  easily implemented using traditional analog filtering theory; and  6) the method can also be implemented using known and effective  algorithms extensively used in the field of control theory for the  solution of Riccati equations.   ***",
