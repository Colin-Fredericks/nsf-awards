 "awd_abstract_narration": "MILLERO  9400784    This project will continue the study of how ionic interactions  affect processes in seawater and other natural waters.  In the next  two years efforts will be directed at how ionic interactions affect  the rates of oxidation and reduction of metals and nonmetals in  seawater. Measurements of the rates will be made in seawater as a  function of pH, salinity, temperature and composition to elucidate  the effect of the ionic components of seawater. Studies of the  products and intermediates of the reactions will be made (when  possible) in an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of the actions.  During the next two years it is also planned to continue  measurements on oxidation of H2S with the oxides of Fe(II) in  seawater. The measurements will be made as a function of pH,  temperature, and salinity.  The disappearance of H2S and the  appearance of Fe(II) will be measured. It is also planned to  determine how the products S, SO3 2-, and S2O3 2- are affected by  pH, temperature, and salinity.  Studies will also be initiated on  the reduction of Fe(III) with H2S03 and the oxidation of Fe(II)  with O2 at nM levels in natural waters.  New thermodynamic modeling  will be carried out on the carbonate system and the state of Fe(II)  and Fe(III) in seawater. These studies will hopefully lead to a  consistent set of stability constants and Pitzer interaction  parameters that can be used to characterize these systems in  natural waters.",
