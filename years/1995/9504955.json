In the first area the main goals are to extend the work of Baum and Petrie  (1966) and the investigators to underlying continuous state and time Markov  processes and Markov random fields; and to study methods which achieve  computational savings without sacrificing efficiency.  In the second area,  the goal of the investigators is to produce a unified approach to testing  and model selection between and within models arising in biostatistics,  econometric and elsewhere.  In the third area, the goal is to study m out  of n with and without replacement bootstraps for various purposes including  setting critical values in difficult testing situations.            The goal of this research is to develop statistically sound and  computationally feasible estimates, tests, and error bounds in some types  of complex models for data that arise, naturally in a number of important  fields.  Applications of hidden Markov models include speech recognition by  machine and estimation of genomic sequence characteristics, of significance  in biotechnology.  Applications of semiparametric models include  transportation choice and other aspects of civil infrastructure studies.  Reliable resampling methods, our final area of study are essential for  calculating error bounds and thresholds for the complex procedures we are  developing and in fact are an essential part of the procedures as a whole.  Their implementation is possible only in our age of ever more rapid  computation.",
