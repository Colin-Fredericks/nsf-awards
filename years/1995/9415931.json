 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to study the variability of plasma irregularities  that occur during spread F conditions in the equatorial zone.  The  work will be done at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory using the new  JULIA system, which is being installed there.  Jicamarca has been  the primary source of radar observations of spread F plasma  irregularities since they were first systematically observed there  over two decades ago.  However, the impracticality of operating the  complete Jicamarca radar at regular intervals for large stretches  of time has led to a rather sporadic record of spread F  observations.  The low power JULIA system that is being implemented  will allow more routine observations to be made.  The work will  include the development of experimental radar modes especially  suited to spread F investigations and designed to make the best use  of the Jicamarca antenna and the JULIA signal processing hardware.   Software to manage the data acquisition as well as on-line data  diagnostics will be written.  Finally, a process for routinely  collecting data, processing it into a compact form, and  transmitting it to the CEDAR database will be established.  A  complete, long-duration record of plasma irregularities over  Jicamarca during spread F would offer invaluable insight into the  onset conditions, dynamics, and transport processes related to the  underlying plasma instabilities.",
