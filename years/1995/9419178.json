 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is supported by the  Inogranic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for  development of a novel synthetic route to functional  metalloproteins.  Dr. John Caradonna of the Department of  Chemistry, Yale University, will use a combinatorial approach to  construct proteins with active metal sites inside host proteins  of known structure.  Effectively, reaction initiates a search for  the constellation of backbone positions that satisfies the  geometry of the active site without affecting the host protein's  tertiary structure.  The mutant proteins constructed would be  tested for enzymatic activity.  The initial experiments will  attempt to synthesize the iron site of superoxide dismutase, so a  successful outcome could lead to a powerful tool in reducing  tissue damage resulting from  superoxide.  One immediate result  will be the ability to test the effect of secondary protein  topologies on the chemistry of metalloproteins.    The active sites of metal-containing enzymes consist of metals  bound to proteins folded in a certain pattern.  By devising a  means of adding the metal without disrupting the folding pattern,  this research could lead to a method of synthesizing  metalloenzymes that are functional, and thus ready for use in  biological investigations and applications.  In the process, the  effect of protein structure on activity of metalloenzymes will be  studied.",
