 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two day invitational workshop is being held to examine critical issues relating to  environmental technology education.  The workshop involves postsecondary educators  in the fields of mathematics, science, environmental education, and technology as well  as employers, secondary school educators, and government representatives.  Forum  participants, working in one of six technical groups, are identifying and prioritizing  issues and developing recommendations concerning Environmental Technology  education at two-year colleges.  Each working group is being directed by a technical  working group chair recognized as an expert in a particular area.  The working groups  are addressing issues in the professionalization of environmental technician education;  curriculum and program development and implementation; preparation, credentials,  professional advancement, and continuing education of faculty; human resources  including recruitment, retention, and placement of students; current and future  employment needs for environmental technicians; and preparation of secondary school  students for successful entry into postsecondary environmental technical education  programs.    The workshop report is being distributed to academic institutions and the private sector  as well as local and federal government staff interested in environmental technology  education.  Planning and implementation of the forum is a cooperative effort involving  the NSF Advanced Technology Environmental Education Center (ATEEC), the  Hazardous Materials Training and Research Institute (HMTRI), the American  Association of Community Colleges (AACC), and the National Science Foundation  (NSF).",
