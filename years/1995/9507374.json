 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507374  Bagnara      The proposed research is directed toward understanding the cellular and molecular basis for pigmentation patterns (e.g. dorsal, ventral, spots, stripes, mottling, etc.) of vertebrates of all classes.  It is based upon the premise that local pigmentary patterns are expressed under the localized influence of trophic or inhibitory factors (molecules) that are found in the skin manifesting the circumscribed pigmentary pattern.  Thus, the common dorsal/ventral pattern would result from the enhanced expression of melanophores (-cytes) dorsally under the influence of a localized melanization stimulating factor (MSF) while the pale ventral surface would result from the inhibition of melanophore (-cyte) expression by a ventrally located melanization inhibiting factor (MIF).  Presumably, localized action of MSF leads to a localized expression of dark pigmentation while the opposite holds for MIF.  MIF has just been purified from leopard frog skin (Rana forreri) and a monoclonal antibody has been raised against it.  The monoclonal antibody against MIF is being used as a probe to both further purify MIF and to detect its localization in the skin.  In fact, MIF has been essentially purified and characterized biochemically.  It is Dr. Bagnara's primary objective to clone and sequence the gene for MIF with an eye toward comparing it with the protein product of the agouti gene.  The latter is responsible for the agouti pigmentation pattern of mammals.  In addition, he proposes to examine the mechanism of action of MIF on the process of melanin synthesis.  In particular, he wishes to test the effects of MIF on the specific enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the black pigment of the skin, hair, and feathers.  ***",
