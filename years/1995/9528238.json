 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528238  Howell  This proposal describes research in Microelectronical Systems (MEMS) with particular emphasis on the development of an approach to perform computer simulation of complex MEMS systems.  The object of the research is to investigate the concept of applying a generalized complaint mechanism design theory of MEMS.  The basic idea is to develop a \"computationally compact\" method to model MEMS structures using the theory of complaint mechanisms to simplify the description of MEMS structures.  The idea is in contrast to several existing approaches:  (1) a finite-element technique which requires extensive computation time and (2) a solid-mechanics equation method based upon the assumption of linear systems.    In the complaint mechanism approach a pseudo-rigid body model is constructed which embodies the nonlinear features of the system in a compact formalism.  In this proposal the compliant mechanism theory is verified experimentally with the fabrication of test MEMS structures.  These structures will use a 3 polysilicon process with micromachining at Brigham Young University and MCNC.  A simplified theory which allows the design of MEMS will be of great importance to the scientific and engineering community working in these areas.  ***",
