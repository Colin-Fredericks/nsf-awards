Ideally,  one  would  determine  primary production as the sum of the products  of  phytoplankton  taxon  specific  biomass  and  growth  rates.  Although   this   approach   is  currently   not   possible,  phytoplankton biomass and growth rates can be measured using  the  chlorophyll-labeling  method,  which  as  introduced  a  decade  ago.  Taxon specific growth rates can, in principle,  also  be  determined from the 14C labeling  of  carotenoids.  However,  these potentially powerful methods have been  used  on  a  limited  basis because a mechanical understanding  of  what  is  being  measured was lacking.  This  research  will  study  the  14C  labeling  kinetics  of  chlorophyll  a  and  carotenoids  in  nitrogen  limited  continuous  cultures  of  microalgae  grown  under constant light to  extend  previous  research   to  other  carotenoids,  groups  of  algae,   and  conditions of nutrient-limited growth.  The study will  also  determine pigment-labeling kinetics in algae grown  under  a  diel  photocycle  and  algae subject  to  growth  irradiance  changes to assess the limitations of the method when  it  is  performed under conditions of uneven growth.  The results of  this  study will aid other members of the research community  in the interpretation of the pigment labeling experiments.",
