Special cases have been proved directly, and by numerical calculations. Another conjecture concerns integral inequalities which extend the well-known van Den Berg-Kesten Conjecture (rumored to have been proved recently) and suggest interesting new applications. Special cases of the new aonjecture have already been established using FKG type and rearrangement inequalities; numerical calculations seem to support these extensions. d) Limit theorems for dependent random variables, with the goal of obtaining convergence rates in terms of meaningful characteristics  of the dependence structures, using Stein's method and classical approaches.    The assumption of statistical independence of sampled measurements is basic to much of classical data analysis. It is relevant when one can assume that the data arises from repeated controlled experiments in which there is no carryover of errors between repetitions. However,  situations with more complex data are ubiquitous. The proposed research centers on the study of certain aspects of samples  which consist of observations (random variables) which are not independent,  and various models for dependence structures. Such structures are also  relevant in various models in physics, and certain issues arising in   percolation theory, for example, are also studied. Another aspect of this  research is relevant to statistical large sample theory. A good portion of  statistical theory is based  on approximations which are valid only for  large samples. Methods for such approximations for dependent data are  investigated, in order to determine the validity of the theory in complex situation. The quality of the approximations is important in deciding how  large samples must be in order for large sample approximations to be valid.",
