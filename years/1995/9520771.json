 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520771  Understanding  the  mechanisms  that  lead  to   differences  between  individuals  of  related  species  is  one  key  to  understanding   the  pattern  and  process   of   biological  diversification.   Such mechanisms can  include  changes  in  gene  sequences,  changes  in the expression  of  particular  genes   during  growth  and  development  and  environmental  influences.   This  research is aimed at characterizing  the  development  of  pigment patterns  in  a  group  of  closely  related  species.  Collaboration with scientists in Thailand  will provide essential data and enhance research efforts  in  both  countries.  Analysis of growth rates  and  changes  in  patterns  during development will be used to test models  of  pattern formation.  The distribution of color patterns  will  be   compared  with  phylogenetic  relatedness  and  habitat  choice,  to determine the evolutionary sequences of  pattern  changes  and  the  importance of  adaptation  to  particular  ecological  circumstances in controlling pattern  formation.  The  results of this research program will shed light on the  developmental mechanisms that result in changes  in  pattern  formation,  and on their ecological significance.   It  will  aid  in  understanding the origin and persistence of between  species biological diversity.",
