 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cdc28 kinase in budding yeast, and its homologs (cdks) in  higher eukaryotes, function as key regulators to allow progression  through the cell cycle.  The proteins that regulate Cdc2 are  targets for oncogene action.  A genetic screen was undertaken to  identify additional proteins which regulate cell cycle progression.   This screen identified a novel, essential protein kinase, Pdl3.   Mutations in PDL3 affect cell cycle progression through G2 or M and  bud  morphology.  Additional data are consistent with a model where  Pdl3 is required for the activation of Cde 28 kinase.  The primary  goals of these experiments are to:  characterize biochemically the  activity of the kinase, define the function of Pdl3 in cell cycle  control, and identify other components which interact with Pdl3 in  control of morphology and cell cycle progression.    Interactive activities at SUNY Stony Brook include:  teaching two  courses for women in the Project WISE program; teaching a graduate  course in the cell cycle; and acting as advisor to undergraduate  and graduate students doing research in the lab.",
