Nitrogen fixation,  sulfate reduction,  methanogenesis and the availability of many trace elements  are but a few of the processes which are mediated by either  anaerobic bacteria or enzymes which are active only under  anaerobic conditions. There is paradoxical evidence that  anaerobic processes occur in the water column with chemical  signatures of anaerobic microbial activity such as methane  peaks present in marine waters.  Where are these anaerobic  microbial assemblages?  How can anaerobes or anaerobic  processes occur in a well-oxygenated water column.    Microbial assemblages associated with the digestive systems  of marine zooplankton may be important microenvironments for  anaerobic processes in the water column.  From a  microbiological point of view, the gut represents a high  nutrient, low oxygen environment within the high oxygen but  low nutrient environment of the water column.  Nitrogen  fixation and methanogenesis are two of the metabolically-  demanding processes which require large sources of carbon  and energy that could be supplied in the digestive tracts of  marine zooplankton. The primary goal of this ROW planning  award is to select a model organism for a physiological and  ecological study of anaerobes and anaerobic processes in the  gut microflora of marine zooplankton.  One of the immediate  objectives is to survey the gut contents of marine  zooplankton in order to estimate the abundance and  variability of bacteria found within the gut of a variety of  zooplankton and select a suitable candidate species for  further study.  The key to success in this study of gut  anaerobes and anaerobic processes will be the use of strict  anaerobic technique, a procedure which has not been  routinely used in other studies of marine anaerobes.  ***",
