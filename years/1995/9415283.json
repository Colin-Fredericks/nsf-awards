 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415283  Lander  The objective of this proposal is to develop an optimal filtering  methodology based on the concept of the A posteriori Wiener  filter applied to a time frequency representation of a noisy  signal, and to quantify the performance characteristics on high  resolution electrocardiographic signals.  Frequently, in the  analysis of biological and other repetitive signals, it is  necessary to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.  Ensemble  averaging is universally used to reduce noise for estimating  these signals.  A posteriori Wiener filters are a class of  optimal filters which can be applied to any ensemble of  deterministic, repetitive, noisy signals.  They have the  potential to improve very significantly upon the performance of  ensemble averaging, with applications in many areas of signal  processing.  In practice, optimal filters have yet to realize  their full potential with biological and other signals.  This is  due to their nonstationarity for which no adequate mathematical  description exists.    The work carried out as described is expected to produce  fundamental knowledge in the field of biomedical signal  processing, and has considerable intrinsic scientific merit  beyond the specific application proposed for investigation.  ***",
