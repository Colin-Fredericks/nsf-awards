 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in biophysical modeling between Xiao-Jing Wang of the University of Pittsburgh and David Hansel of the Ecole Polytechnique, Paliseau, France.  The objective of their research is to  undertake biophysical modeling of 40 Hz oscillations in neurons and neural systems.  They will address:  rhythmogenesis; network mechanisms underlying synchronization and large variability; and the intermittent nature of 40 Hz oscillations.   Rhythmic activity in mammalian brains at the 30 to 50 Hz oscillation rate has been shown to coincide with increased focal attention and may have important functional roles in perception and information processing.  The proposed collaboration focuses on these physiological and cognitive issues by combining unique abilities of the investigators. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in biophysical modeling. This is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in the dynamics of large neural networks.  Their joint effort will advance our knowledge of the physiological and biophysical mechanisms underlying neuronal cooperative rhythmically and its role in the organization of mammalian brain activity.",
