 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504259  Mohney    This Research Planning Grant focuses on studies to understand  fundamental materials science aspects of thermally stable electrical  contacts to group III nitrides, primarily Gallium Nitride (GaN).  Thermodynamic calculations will be used, along with x-ray diffraction  and electron probe microanalysis of bulk phase equilibria samples, to  determine key features of the solid phase diagrams in the Metal-Ga-N  systems.  This investigation will aid in the selection of thermally  stable contact materials.  In addition, because of the high vapor  pressure of N2 over GaN and the presumed role of N vacancies on the  carrier concentration in GaN, the gas phase equilibria are expected to  exert a greater influence on the thermal stability and electrical  properties of contacts to GaN than they do for contacts to the other  III-V semiconductors.  Both novel and conventional methods to control  the GaN point defect concentration and the contact/GaN barrier height  will then be evaluated for their potential to engineer the electrical  properties of those contacts that are already attractive from the  standpoint of thermal stability.  These methods will include attempts  to manipulate the N vacancy concentration immediately beneath the  contact/GaN interface to influence the n-type carrier concentration.  The role of the work function of the contact material on the barrier  height and subsequent performance of the contact  will also be  evaluated.  %%%  While this project will focus primarily on the development of  electrical contacts to Gallium Nitride, it will also be of benefit for  future design of contacts to other group III nitrides, and will  contribute to a greater understanding of materials issues for these  semiconductors.  During the planning period of the project, at least  two model systems will be selected to test ideas for controlling the  electrical properties and stability of contacts to Gallium Nitride.  The planning period will aid the PI in accomplishing enough  prelimin ary work to show the promise of ideas or to modify them based  on the data acquired. Thus, support during the planning period will  aid the PI in preparing a more competitive full proposal.  ***",
