U.S. involvement in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) offers significant opportunities to help inform change during this critical time.  TIMSS results will test and to advance the theoretical underpinnings of systemic reform by providing empirical analyses as well as new methodologies.  The request for funding contained in this proposal is for data analysis and dissemination activities.  In particular this proposal asks for: 1) continuing support for the U.S. National Research Center; 2) the development of an analytical strategy for linking the intended curriculum (curriculum analysis) to the curriculum implemented by teachers in the classroom and finally to what students learn; 3) the analysis of the U.S. TIMSS data and writing of the corresponding reports with an eye toward informing current policy initiative and reform efforts and 4) public relations and dissemination activities designed to make these results available to various constituencies especially the general public and business communities.  Two current policy initiatives are important to this proposal: (1) t he National Educational Goals and (2) content-driven systemic school reform.  This proposal states our purpose to perform the work that not only is grounded in the comparative education tradition and also will enable the TIMSS data to address central policy questions of interest to the United States and disseminate the knowledge gained to interested national audiences: policy makers, researchers, educators, business and community leaders and parents.                         ;                                     Oh     +'  0                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       The results of these policy initiatives and supporting research have been an emerging movement towards content-driven systemic change and the formulation of national education goals.
