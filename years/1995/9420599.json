 "awd_abstract_narration": "MCB-9420599  Boorer    The cloned H+/hexose transporters from Arabidopsis (STP),  H+/sucrose transporters from spinach (SoSUC1) and potato  (StSUC1) and a H+/amino acid transporter from Arabidopsis  (NAT2) will be expressed in Xenopus oocytes.  Their  transport kinetics will be investigated using the 2-  electrode voltage-clamp and the cut-open oocyte vaseline gap  methods to determine the external and internal transport  reaction steps of the transporters.  The dependence of  maximal rate of transport, imax, and the apparent affinity  K0.5 for ligands on voltage and the concentration of ligands  will be determined.  Measurement of reversal potentials and  the simultaneous measurement of the flux of labelled  substrates and H+ currents will be used to determine the  stoichiometry of transport.   Analysis of the presteady-  state kinetics will provide unique insights in both partial  reaction steps of the transport reaction cycle and the  number of transporters in the membrane.  This kinetic  information will be used to formulate and examine transport  models to describe the kinetic properties of the sugar and  amino acid transporters.  Mutant transporters which have  been tested for function by complementing yeast amino acid  transport mutants will be expressed in oocytes and a  detailed kinetic characterization of the transporters will  be undertaken. This will allow transport models to be  tested.  For SoSUC1 and STSUC1 specific interactions between  transported substrates and inhibitors of transport will be  investigated and the optimal 3D structure  for recognition  by the transporter determined by energy minimization and  molecular model building.  In the long term, a concensus  structure for transported analogues may be used to target  the sucrose transporter in the design of novel herbicides  and pesticides.  Also, the mutants transtporters will be  used to alter the partitioning of carbon and nitrogen in  transgenic plants which will, in turn, lead to the  introduction of favorable agron omic traits into crop plants.  %%%  The goal of this study is to understand the molecular  mechanisms underlying the transport of amino acids and  sugars into and out of plant cells. Amino acids and sugars  are essential nutrients and are transported into plant cells  via H+-coupled cotransporters which are integral membrane  protiens that couple the uptake of substrates to the  electrochemical gradient for H+ generated by the H+- pumping  ATPase.  These transporters play a vital role in the  partitioning of assimilates between source and sink tissues  which is a major determinant of crop yield.  The approach  will be to express the cloned H+-dependent hexose, sucrose  and amino acid transporters in Xenopus oocytes and to use  electrophysiological and radiotracer flux techniques to  characterize the biophysical properties and kinetics (ligand  specificity, ligand stoichiometry, voltage-dependence,  reversiblity) of these cotransporters.   These studies will  be combined with molecular biological techniques to  characterize mutant transporters which will allow the  identification of specific amino acid residues involved in  H+ and substrate-binding  and transport mechanisms.  ***",
