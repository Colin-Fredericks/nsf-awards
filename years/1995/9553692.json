The Alliance also represents K-12         school systems, a major state university, community-based         organizations, government agencies, labor, business, and         industry interests in southeastern Michigan.    Overall Goal of the Project         1. Develop a SCANS based model for manufacturing program,         which will map the standards in each of the three disciplines:         product design, industrial controls, and manufacturing.         Specific tasks to be accomplished will be involve:          identification of skill standards which relate to engineering         technologies, organize workshops to review skill standards,         create model competencies, study professional organization         certification procedures, and provide access to the         information on curriculum, and certification via WWW SMARTE         alias.           2. Establish pilot enrichment programs for students that will         begin preparation for coursework in the technologies as early         as elementary school grades. This would result in holding at         least one two-week intensified summer institute for the local         public school students, and at least two workshops at         community college sites to encourage elementary and middle         school students primarily minorities and females into         technology fields.           3. Develop curriculum in product design, and this curriculum         will be shared with faculty and teachers of the conso rtium         through a \"hands-on\" workshop.",
