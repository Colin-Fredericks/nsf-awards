 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500827  Law  Ions  in solution frequently form electrical double layers at surfaces  which  modify  the surface phenomena of wetting and adsorption.  These  surface  effects  are  important  in  many  physical,  chemical,   and  biological  processes such as lubrication, catalysis, and  fluid  flow  through  biological membranes and porous media. This project will  use  the  techniques  of elllipsometry and neutron reflectometry  to  study  wetting and adsorption in critical ionic mixtures. These mixtures  are  known  to  exhibit  either mean field or Ising behavior  in  the  bulk  depending  upon  the dielectric properties of the solvent.  This  bulk  behavior is still not understood from a theoretical point of view. The  liquid/liquid and liquid/substrate surface properties of such mixtures  have  never  been studied before and this project should  enhance  our  understanding  of  the complex interaction between  bulk  and  surface  ionic processes  %%%  Ions in solution frequently adsorb at surfaces and modify the physical  characteristics of the surface. This effect can be important  in  many  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  membrane  processes   such   as  lubrication catalysis and fluid flow through biological membranes  and  porous  media. The adsorption of ions is determined by the  underlying  properties  of the bulk liquid solution. In this project, the  surface  properties  of  critical ionic mixtures will be studied,  using  light  reflection  and  neutron  reflection  techniques,  near  the  critical  temperature where the bulk properties of these solutions vary  rapidly  with temperature. This proposal will enhance our understanding of  the  complex interplay between bulk and surface ionic processes.  ***",
