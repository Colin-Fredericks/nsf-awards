 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9423707    The goal of this project is the synthesis, characterization, and  surface chemistry of well defined, ultra-thin (less than 10 nm)  oxide films. Ultra-thin oxide films will be prepared on  refractory single crystal substrates and characterized using an  array of surface science techniques, including low energy  electron diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy, X-ray and  ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and, ion scattering  spectroscopy,  reflection absorption Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy, high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy,  scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy, and  temperature programmed desorption. Ordered, oxide surfaces in  thin film form will be prepared on single-crystal, refractor  metal substrates. This approach will be extended to include a  variety of oxide and mixed-oxide types. A methodology utilizing  these highly ordered, stoichiometric oxide thin films offers a  promising new strategy for studying the surface chemistry of  these materials in ways precluded utilizing the bulk materials  and traditional  techniques.    %%%  This study impacts the basic science of oxides and various  practical technologies such as environmental waste remediation,  device fabrication, and catalysis. Because of the highly  insulating nature of many oxide materials, their surface  geometrical and electronic properties, in general, have received  much less attention than, for example, metal surfaces. To date,  extensive work on the chemisorption and catalytic properties of  oxide materials have been conducted, however, the microscopic  reaction mechanisms occurring on oxide surfaces are still not  well understood. The principle reason for this is that these  studies have been performed primarily on powder samples.  Therefore, the information represents an average of the various  crystal faces exposed in addition to a variety of defects which  are inevitably present in the powdered samples. On the other  hand, high-purity single cr ystals of many oxide materials have  been difficult to obtain and studies of these insulating  materials have often encountered the difficulties associated with  surface charging, sample heating and cleaning. Therefore, there  is a clear need for the synthesis of high quality, thin oxide  films. Structural and chemisorptive properties of oxide materials  can be obtained by preparing well-defined, thin oxide films whose  properties are identical to their single-crystal bulk  counterparts, thereby facilitating surface chemical studies of  these materials under controlled conditions.",
