 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423689  Zucker    Professor Zucker will study locally symmetric spaces via methods  of algebraic geometry. In particular he wants to study the  relationship between various Hodge structures and cohomology of a  locally symmetric variety. He will also study extensions of  intersection cohomology to a class of real analytic varieties  with a view to proving a version of the decomposition theorem.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-  century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding  application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical  computer science, and robotics.  ***",
