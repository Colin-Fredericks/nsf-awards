 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is  directed towards identifying those factors which limit the sensitivity and accuracy  of atmospheric pressure plasma based mass spectrometry. During the tenure of this  three-year standard grant, Professor Paul Farnsworth and his students at Brigham  Young University will investigate the processes under which an ion beam is  extracted from an inductively coupled plasma source, and directed into a mass  spectrometer for analysis.  Two techniques will be used to characterize this  process. The first involves placing a nickel mesh in the path of the ion beam for  a fixed time period prior to removal for analysis by scanning electron microscopy.  The second approach is based on laser induced fluorescence of selected ionic  species within the ion plume. These studies will allow a much more accurate  picture of the ion beam extraction process, and should permit the design  of highly  efficient inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers.     Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is rapidly becoming the method of  choice for low level determinations of elemental composition for a wide range of  samples in areas ranging from the environment to biotechnology. At present, the efficiency of  ion transport in these devices is the limiting factor in their performance. Paul Farnsworth and  his students at Brigham Young University are characterizing the ion extraction processes.  The  results from these studies could allow a new generation of spectrometers with improved accuracy  and higher sensitivities to be designed.",
