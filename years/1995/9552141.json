 "awd_abstract_narration": "A modeling and simulation laboratory that will contain a  network of 25 Pentium 90MHz microcomputers equipped with C++,  MATLAB and the simulation language SIMSCRIPT is being  established.  A computer-based approach to teaching mathematical  modeling is being developed with special emphasis on computer  simulation using a simulation language.  The laboratory and new  teaching approach revitalizes the applied mathematics program.   It represents a departmental effort to improve the education of  ethnically diverse students and, in the process, makes them  better prepared for employment.       A new introductory course is being developed that is  designed to help students become comfortable with the use of  personal computers to solve quantitative problems and discover  principles and concepts via experimentation.  Students use  interactive software, including MATLAB, as well as write programs  of their own. The course prepares students for the revised  2-course sequence in modeling.         The first of these courses focuses on deterministic models.   Models of systems, particularly ones that are difficult  mathematically, are introduced in class, and software  implementing the models is ppovided.  Students will then use the  computer to draw conclusions about the model and the system they  are studying.  The second course in the modeling sequence  introduces computer simulation of stochastic systems and covers  techniques of effective simulation modeling.  It also covers the  implementation of these models on personal computers using the  industry-standard simulation language SIMSCRIPT.         All three of these classes are held in the laboratory.   Instructors demonstrate the software and models by broadcasting  computations to workstations.  They are also able to view work in  progress at any of the computers in the network.  A computer is  available for each student.  Students will experiment with  models, explore their ramifications, contrast results with the  system they are studying,  and modify models as required.  They  will also be able to easily generate professional quality reports  and present their results.  In the process, students will gain  experience that will serve them well in their future careers.  It  is expected that several other courses, particularly those in  numerical analysis and statistics, will be taught in the  laboratory with similar beneficial results.",
