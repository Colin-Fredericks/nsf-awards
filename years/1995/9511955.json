The project develops and tests models that incorporate  family behavior, endowment inequality within and among families,   and interactions between family resources and opportunities for  post-secondary schooling.  The project investigates issues of  bias and potential bias in estimates obtained using standard  cross-sectional, sibling and twins  estimators,  the role and  importance of measurement errors, and the effects of unmeasured  shocks differentiating human capital investments among siblings,   net of endowment differences.  The models will be applied to a  newly-collected large-scale survey data set describing identical   twins, their spouses, their children and their parents using a  questionnaire designed specifically to elicit information  relevant to the project s objectives within family and life-cycle  contexts.      More specifically, the project will yield estimates of (1)  endowment effects on human capital investments - measured by time  in school, school quality, and work experience - and financial  transfers between adults and their parents, (2) how such effects   varied across cohorts with different college and labor market  opportunities, (3) differences in such investment determinants  across men and women and by family background, and (4) the  consequences of these interactions among endowments, family  behavior, family resource constraints and schooling opportunities  fort the distributions of earnings and income.  The  investigations will also help determine the value of twins data  in social science research, which is currently imperfectly  understood.  The project will also produce a public-use data set   from the new survey data.",
