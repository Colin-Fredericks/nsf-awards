Based on  the Russian materials \"To Create the Universe,\" the course is CD-ROM-based, with an accompanying \"mini-textbook,\" a manual on small-scale laboratories, a teacher's guide, and a teacher-training workshop kit.  The topics include  the design of atoms and molecules of the first 36 elements and a study of their properties.  The materials embody design challenges to be completed with powerful software and computer applications.  This software, including both commercial and newly developed programs, offers flexible and motivating situations so students can design new structures and experiments related to abstract concepts in chemistry.  Students learn these concepts by interactively controlling computer visualizations and animations of dynamic atomic and molecular behavior.   National leaders in curriculum development for chemistry in the US and in Russia are involved in design and preparation of materials and guidance is provided by a prestigious international advisory board",
