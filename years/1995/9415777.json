 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative  research in inorganic and organometallic chemistry between  Kenneth J. Balkus, Jr. of the University of Texas at Dallas  and Fethi Bedioui of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de  Chimie in Paris. The objectives of their research are to  prepare novel, microporous materials and  to evaluate their  electrochemical activity.  They will synthesize and modify  zeolites.  Related metal oxides research  will involve  electrochemistry and electrocatalysis with novel zeolite  host-guest materials.  Zeolites are important new materials  with applications, for example,  in diagnostic  pharmaceuticals and in chemical sensors.  This project will  advance our understanding of the reactivity of zeolite  composites and their homogenous properties.  This  collaboration takes advantage of complementary resources and  expertise.  The U.S. investigator and his group at the  University of Texas are experts in the synthesis and  characterization of catalytic materials and will prepare the  new materials. This will be complemented by French expertise  in electrochemical analysis.",
