Criteria for model selection among mixtures and  convolutions of exponential distributions are proposed and shown  to be asymptotically close to Bayes procedures.  The performance  of the criteria are compared to that of complexity based model  selection criteria.  The methodology is then applied to data from  ethological science.  The case of mixtures of multiple regression  models and logistic regression models is also considered and  applied to the problem of testing for son preference in Vietnam,  using data from the Vietnam Living Standard Survey.      In many modeling situations, a single model is not suitable for  all the data.  For example, when investigating whether there is  significant statistical evidence of son preference (preference for  boys over girls) in countries such as Vietnam, the problem is   complicated by the fact that some families display son preference  and some do not.  In ethological science, an area of behavioral   science concerned with detailed observation and recording of the  behavior of one or more individuals, interesting questions arise  as to whether a behavior can be split into consecutive activities  or is a mixture of several activities.  These problems can be   addressed by modeling with statistical mixtures.",
