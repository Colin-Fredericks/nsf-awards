 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Prof. Richard Saykally of the Department of Chemistry of the   University of California at Berkeley will engage in continuing studies of   the structure and dynamics of weakly bound molecular complexes.  Special   emphasis is paid to the dynamical aspects.  The experimental data will be   obtained by ultra high resolution laser spectroscopy and their analysis   will be accompanied by rigorous theoretical modeling  in order to obtain   highly detailed intermolecular potential energy surfaces.  Specifically,   the data from which this information is extracted are   vibration-rotation-tunneling  (VRT) spectra.  Extensions to hydrated   proton complexes and amino acid complexes will be made possible by   continued developments in the technology of VRT spectroscopy.  Since   intramolecular interactions are known to be non-additive, the emphasis   will be on trimer and higher order complexes.    The structure and dynamics of condensed phase matter, other than metals   and semiconductors, is largely determined by the weak interactions   between strongly bound molecules.  This research serves to obtain a   better molecular level understanding of the intermolecular interactions   that govern the behavior of condensed phase systems, including those of   biological importance.",
