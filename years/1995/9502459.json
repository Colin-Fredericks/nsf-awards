 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502459  Weiss  Positron  annihilation  induced  Auger  Electron  Spectroscopy  (PAES)  utilizes   a  fundamentally  new  process  in  which  the  excitations  necessary for Auger spectroscopy are created by positrons annihilating  core  electrons  and  not,  as  in  conventional  Auger  methods,   by  collisional  ionization. PAES is uniquely sensitive  to  the  critical  topmost atomic layer of solids due to the trapping of positrons in  an  image  potential  well  just outside the surface before  annihilation.  Experiments are proposed which will capitalize on this ability of PAES  to  determine  the elemental content of the topmost  atomic  layer  in  achieving an understanding of catalytically important ultrathin  metal  fillm systems, including neodynium on copper, and copper on palladium,  as  well  as to study surface segregation in alloys such as  platinum-  nickle  and platinum-gold. The fact that PAES measurements can be made  using  energy  doses many orders of magnitude less than  those  needed  with  conventional Auger techniques will be utilized to study  fragile  adsorbed layers and chemically unstable systems including hydrogen and  organic molecules on metal surfaces.  %%%  Positron  annihilation  induced  Auger  Electron  Spectroscopy  (PAES)  utilizes  a  fundamentally  new process  in  which  the  input  energy  required  for the emission of so-called Auger electrons from  a  solid  results from the annihilation of positive electrons (antimatter)  with  negative  electrols  in atomic cores rather than  from  collisions  of  energetic   incident  electrons  with  the  core  electrons,   as   in  conventional  Auger  methods.   PAES  is  uniquely  sensitive  to  the  composition of the critical topmost atomic layer of solids due to  the  trapping  of  positrons just outside the surface before  annihilation.  The  proposed experiments will capitalize on this sensitivity of  PAES  to  determine  the elemental content of the topmost  atomic  layer  to  advance   undertanding  of   catalytically  important  ultrathin   film  materials,  such  as  copper on palladium, and to  study  the  surface  segregation of constituent elements in alloys such as platinum-nickel.  In  addition, the fact that PAES measurements can be made using energy  doses  hundereds  of times weaker than those needed with  conventional  Auger  methods will be utilized to study fragile adsorbed  layers  and  chemically  unstable coverings such as hydrogen and organic  molecules  on metal surfaces.  ***",
