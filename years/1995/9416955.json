 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416955  Hoagland  A \"strong\" flow field can substantially deform the usual coiled  conformation of a long flexible polymer.  This investigation will  use laser light scattering to measure the molecular deformation of  dilute polymer chains (MW<10 million) dissolved in a flowing  solvent. Experiments will focus on opposed jets and orifice flows,  geometries where the flow field best approximates uniaxial  elongation.  Variables characterizing the chain, solvent, and flow  strength will be adjusted systematically to test polymer/flow  models from the literature.  When flow-induced tension in the  backbone becomes sufficiently large, the chain breaks, generating  two fragment chains of potentially unequel molecular weight.  The  breadth of the fragment distribution reflects the chain  conformation at the instant of fracture.  Gel electrophoresis will  be employed to examine the distributions produced in various steady  and transient laminar flows capable of chain deformation and  fracture.  Turbulent drag reduction has often been explained using  polymer/flow models that presuppose full chain extension; a study  of chain fragments created in drag reducing flow will allow this  hypothesis to be tested.  %%%  Flow-induced molecular deformation and chain fracture have been  observed in nearly every application or environment where polymer  solutions are found.  A list of polymer technologies that would  benefit from an improved understanding of polymer/flow interaction,  and especially of flow-induced chain extension, includes the  following:  control and stabilization of bulk elongational flow  properties (foods, coatings), filtration and processing in porous  matrices (biopolymer manipulation, oil recovery), lubrication of  sliding surfaces (memory devices, motor oils), and solution  spinning (flow-induced crystallization of natural proteins,  preparation of high modulus fibers).",
