 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elucidation of the detailed molecular structures of proteins and  viruses by x-ray crystallography has provided a wealth of  information concerning relationships between structures and  activities. Although the number of known protein structures is  now quite large, the number of virus structures known is still  rather small, as a result of the enormous amount of human,  experimental and computational resources consumed in such an  investigation. A step that is particularly crucial in determining  virus structures, and some protein structures, is a computational  procedure called electron density modification.  It is not  uncommon however, for this procedure to converge to an incorrect  solution.  This is referred to here as stagnation.  It is then  necessary to collect additional experimental data, usually from  heavy atom derivatives.  It is not always possible to prepare  derivative crystals of sufficient quality, in which case  determination of the structure is precluded.  Even if derivative  crystals of sufficient quality can be prepared, their  preparation, and the subsequent collection and processing of the  additional diffraction data, can consume one or more person-years  of effort.    This proposal is concerned with developing new density  modification algorithms that are less prone to stagnation.  These  new algorithms will be based on techniques that have proved  successful in overcoming stagnation problems in other areas of  image reconstruction such as in astronomy, and will be adapted  here for use in macromolecular crystallography.  The algorithms  will be implemented as computer programs and applied to the  determination of virus and protein structures that are currently  under investigation.  The algorithms will be designed so that  they can be implemented on massively parallel computer  architectures, to take full advantage of emerging computer  technologies.    The impact of successful completion of the project will be  substantial.  (1) It will provide a route for the determ ination  of structures that are resistant to solution by current  techniques.  (2) It will offer the possibility of true ab initio  structure determination of icosohedral viruses.  (3) In cases  where structure determination is currently possible only by the  slow and tedious collection and analysis of heavy atom derivative  data, it will reduce the effort involved (by as much as one or  more person-years per structure) by decreasing the amount and  quality of derivative data required.  The effect will be a more  rapid, efficient, and cost-effective determination of  macromolecular structures, and a larger pool of structures  available for study.",
