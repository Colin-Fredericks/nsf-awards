The compound has a first-order phase  transition  where  the  lattice  constant and valence change  discontinuously  with  no  change  in  symmetry. Additional,  novel  thermodynamic  properties are encountered in the series of compounds obtained by  substitution  of  silver for indium. The principal  investigators  have  succeeded in the difficult task of growing single  crystals  of  these  materials  which will exhaustively  characterized  via  resistivity, susceptibility, thermal expansion, elastic constants  and neutron scattering as a function of temperature, pressure and  magnetic  field. The equation of state will be determined  in  an  effort to understand the basis for the phase transition in  terms  of  electronic and magnetic properties of these highly correlated  electron, or \"heavy fermion\",  materials.  %%%  Non-Technical  Abstract:  A  small number  of  metals  exhibit  a  property  analogous to the condensation of a gas to a liquid:  as  the  temperature  is  lowered below a critical  temperature,  the  density  changes  discontinuously,  with  no  change  in  crystal  symmetry.  There is an accompanying decrease in the  strength  of  the  magnetism  of the metal. The investigators in  this  project  have  recently  learned  how to grow  large  crystals  of  a  new  intermetallic compound displaying the condensation behavior.  The  project  involves  a  thorough investigation  of  the  structure,  magnetism,  and  electronic behavior  of  the  compound  and  its  alloys.  The goal is to understand the nature of the interactions  between  electrons  which drive the condensation,  in  particular  there  seems to be subtle interplay between the magnetism of  the  material  and its cohesi ve energy. Such studies will improve  our  understanding of the conditions under which electrons  in  solids  help  to coherently bond the atoms in the crystalline state.  The  results may provide important information for the entire field of  metal physics and magnetism.",
