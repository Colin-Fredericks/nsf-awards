 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505813  Fischer    The ovule is a fundamental unit of plant reproduction that  generates the female gametophyte, mediates fertilization processes,  and support the development of the embryo. The long term goal of  this proposal is to understand the genetic circuits that control  the early development of the ovule by analyzing two Arabidopsis  genes, BELL1 (BEL1) and OVULE MUTATION2 (OVM2), that were cloned in  Dr. Fischer's laboratory. The BEL1 gene product plays a role in the  specification of ovule identity. bel1 mutant ovules are often  transformed into carpel like structures, isolation and sequencing  of the BEL1 gene indicates that it encodes a homeodomain  transcription factor. It is thought that the BEL1 gene prevents the  carpel developmental program from over-riding ovule development by  negatively regulating expression of the floral homeotic gene,  AGAMOUS(AG). The OVM2 gene product is needed at distinct threshold  levels to control ovule and female gametophyte development,  respectively. With no active OVM2 protein, both ovule and female  gametophyte development are dramatically suppressed, whereas a low  level of OVM2 protein results in nonfunctional ovules that  specifically lack a female gametophyte. Isolation and sequencing of  the OVM2 gene indicates that it is related to the floral homeotic  gene APETALA2 (AP2). Thus, BEL1 and OVM2 genes are important  regulators of ovule and female gametophyte development, with  mutations resultilg in homeotic conversions and deletions of  organs. To understand their mechanism of action, the critical steps  that control early ovule development, and the relationship between  ovule and floral developmental programs, experiments will be  carried out to: 1) Determine the temporal and spatial localization  of BEL1 and OVM2 activity, 2) Determine the genetic relationships  between ovule and floral regulatory genes, 3) Carry out a molecular  analysis of BEL1 and OVM2 function, and 4) Carry out a genetic  screen to identify new genes that control  megagametogenesis.  ***",
