 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520752    Atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected to double within  the  next   80   years  due  to  burning  of  fossil  fuels   and  deforestation of tropical rainforests.  Analyses of  ancient  air  trapped  within ice have shown that atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  may  have been as low as 50% of the  current  level  approximately  20,000 years ago.  We know that  many  plants  increase  growth  and  reproduction when  grown  under  high  carbon  dioxide  and decrease growth and  reproduction  when  grown  under  low  carbon dioxide.   We  know  very  little,  however,  about  the  evolutionary responses  of  plants  to  changing  levels  of  carbon dioxide.  That  information  is  needed  to:  a)  accurately predict  plant  responses  under  future  scenarios of high carbon dioxide, b) understand  how  plants survived during low carbon dioxide levels of the past  and  c)  determine the processes by which plants  evolve  in  response  to  changing  levels  of  carbon  dioxide.    This  research will use the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a  model  system to study the evolutionary responses of  plants  under  low  and  high  carbon dioxide.   It  will  determine  whether  individual  plants show  variation  in  growth  and  reproduction under low and high carbon dioxide  and  examine  the  response  of  populations to  selection  for  increased  reproduction  under low and high carbon  dioxide.   It  will  test  to see whether such selection produces plants with  an  adaptive  advantage  and  determine what  physiological  and  developmental  processes are associated  with  evolution  of  plants  in  response to carbon dioxide.  This research  will  increase our understanding of the processes by which  plants  adapt  to changing carbon dioxide levels over geologic time,  and  improve  our  ability  to predict  and  understand  the  changes  that plants may undergo due to human-caused changes  in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.",
