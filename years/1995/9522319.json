 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522319  Jain     A laboratory-oriented hands-on curriculum for data communications and computer networking will be developed. This will enable students to experiment with various communications/telecommunications and networking concepts using a workstation, a PC, or a network of workstations. They will be able to design new protocols, verify them using protocol engineering tools, implement them, and visually see the impact of their actions. Data message flows, packet losses, control/routing message flows, virtual circuit setups, link failures, bit errors, etc. will be seen by the students at a slow (visible) speed. Multimedia and sound effects will be used to show abnormal conditions such as errors and losses. Various nodes of the simulated network will be programmable to run automatically or be under manual control of students. The manual control will allow the students to see the effect of unpredictable actions.     The major features of this project include the following: 1) Hands-on laboratory-oriented curriculum requiring students to develop protocol modules and experiment with their designs. 2) Integration of traditional concepts. 3) Use of a distributed gaming/simulation environment to allow experimenting with unpredictable behaviors. 4) Use of multimedia visual techniques to show the effects of various actions 5) Application of protocol engineering principles to protocol development.  ***",
