In recent years, neurobiologists have made  impressive progress in two related areas: one concerns the  biophysical and molecular mechanisms of synapses and the second  concerns the mathematical and logical operations which formally  describe what whole systems of nerve cells do. In the study of  how the visual system works, algorithms successfully model visual  tracking and fixation, binocular vision, and motion detection.  Future progress in understanding more about the visual system  depends upon integrating the biophysical and algorithmic  approaches. This will require detailed information about the  structure and dynamic properties of neurons involved in  particular computations. Many visual systems can compute the  direction and velocity of moving targets. Recent studies indicate  that directional motion detection is achieved through synaptic  operations embedded in the structure of the neuron's receptive  field. The same directional mechanisms were independently found  in visual neurons in higher vertebrates and in the crayfish. The  mechanisms depends upon spatial and temporal asymmetries of the  excitation and inhibition within the receptive field.  This project focuses on experimental and theoretical studies of  the synaptic mechanisms which support directional motion  detection. Physiological measurements will quantify the  characteristics of the synapses which form the directional  mechanism. The simulations will determine if the measured  properties of the synapses are sufficient to support the  directional mechanism.",
