This is a special interagency competition involving NSF, DOE, NASA, and USDA. The work to support all aspects of the review is needed as this special competition is in addition to the normal programs normally run in the Division of Environmental Biology.  The announcement generated 150 proposals, and the interagency review and decision making requires communication and coordination between representatives of the four primary agencies and additional agencies interested in global change research. Friday Services Systems is experienced in supporting such review efforts, and their cost-estimate for the work was deemed cost-effective and responsive to the statement of work provide by NSF. Their services will help insure a careful, thorough, and effective evaluation of the submitted proposals.",
