 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics at Stanford University plans to purchase computer equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. It also proposes to hire a part-time systems administrator to help maintain and to use effectively this equipment.  The computer system in the Mathematics Department at Stanford University is currently adequate only for communication and manuscript preparation.  It is completely inadequate for any serious mathematical computation or visualization projects.  There are several members of the department who have computationally or graphically intensive projects which cannot be performed in the current computer environment.  To correct this situation we are proposing to purchase appropriate equipment.    The inclusion of this equipment into the system and the increase of mathematical activity that they would generate would necessitate support personnel.  The department currently employs a very part-time systems administrator to help with communications problems.  This would be insufficient support for the  expanded computer environment.  The PIs will obtain an additional 25% time systems administration position to supplement the current arrangement.  This position would be responsible for integrating the new equipment and software into the existing system and then would provide support for its maintenance and use.  This would include helping people with their programming needs for research projects.  The equipment will be used for several research projects in mathematics, including in particular:  Evolution Equations in Geometry, Ben Andrews and Brian White. Computational Aspects of Number Theory, Daniel Bump. Hyperbolic Geometry and Geometric Topology, Steven Kerckhoff. A Wavelet-based Seismic Analysis and Simulation Environment, George Papanicolaou.",
