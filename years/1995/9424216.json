New optically active materials will be synthesized, engineered,  and  characterized through the Laser Heated Pedestal Growth method  in  which  non-linear  optical  processes  can  be  accurately  controlled  through  compositional  changes  in the  samples.   In  addition,  the  dynamical  processes  of excited states induced by  narrow  band  non-  equilibrium  phonons  and  magnons  in  ordered  materials   will   be  investigated.   These  studies  will  provide  better  insights   into  relaxation and transport properties in solids.  %%%  Studies of the optical spectroscopic properties of materials which are  luminescent  or emit light are being carried out. The materials  being  studied  are employed in a wide variety of communications and  display  technologies. The project involves methods whereby new materials  with  better properties can be synthesized and improved as a result of their  optical  characterization.   In order to  improve  these  materials  a  fundamental  understanding  of  the interactions  between  the  atomic  centers responsible for emitting light and their surroundings  in  the  solid  host  must  be  arrived  at;  these  processes  often  lead  to  dissipation and relaxation of the optically excited atomic  state  and  need  to  be suppressed to improve material efficiencies.  The optical  studies proposed here are expected to provide basic insights on  these  interactions.  ***",
