 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455588  Ross  The objective of this project is the design and development of an  infrastructure around which formal laboratories in computer science  can be implemented. The central component of the infrastructure is  a software system called DYNALAB, for DYNAmic LABoratory. DYNALAB  will run on Macintosh and IBM-compatible personal computers, as  well as X-terminals connected to central computers. Students using  DYNALAB have access--through a user interface oriented towards  complete novices--to a comprehensive, easily modifiable, and  extendible library of programs and experiments, including  experiments in program structure (e.g., iteration, selection,  recursion, execution-path determination, parameter passing  mechanisms, functions, procedures, and so forth), black box  determination of algorithms, time complexity, space complexity,  program verification, and others. A sophisticated program animation  component allows the execution of programs both forwards and in  reverse, while displaying dynamically and in interactive fashion  the pertinent aspects of program execution, such as the currently  executing statement, values of variables, pointer references, and  statement and memory cell counts (for time and space complexity  experiments). Algorithm animation components also allow abstract  graphical representations of algorithms to be presented on a screen  in forward and reverse modes for algorithm and data structure  studies. Finally, concept animations are included for the study of  fundamental computer science concepts, such as compiling,  multitasking, intractability, and so forth. The desirability of  formal laboratories in the computer science curriculum is well  documented, but few institutions ha e incorporated them for lack of  laboratory resources. It is expected that DYNALAB will be widely  adopted as a tool around which computer science laboratories can be  designed.",
