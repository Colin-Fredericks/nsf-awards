 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504282  Bonahon       Francis Bonahon studies low-dimensional topology and  hyperbolic geometry.  One of the fundamental tools in these two  fields has been the notion of measured geodesic laminations.  The  space of measured geodesic laminations is a certain completion of  the space of simple closed curves on a surface.  Bonahon has  developed a differential calculus on this space of measured  geodesic laminations and is applying his techniques to study  3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds.  For instance, this has enabled  him to analyze the degree of differentiability by which the  geometry of the convex core of a hyperbolic 3-manifold varies as a  function of the hyperbolic metric.  He is currently working on the  problem of classifying hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifolds up to  isometry.       Many problems in topology, geometry and mathematical physics  involve the consideration of all simple closed curves on a surface.  Here, a surface can be something as simple as a plane from which we  have removed a finite number of points (to be thought of as  obstacles); a simple closed curve is a curve in the plane which  avoids the obstacles, ends at the same point where it started, and  does not cut itself in between.  The problem is to understand when  it is possible to deform one such curve into another without  crossing the obstacles.  This is analogous to considering all  possible ways to wrap a string around a certain number of vertical  pegs.  To study these curves, it is useful to go one step higher in  abstraction by considering `generalized curves' which occur as  limits of curves.  This is a typical process in mathematics,  analogous to the one by which, to understand all rational numbers  (such as 2/3 or 47/23), one has to consider all real numbers (such  as pi or square root of 2).  Bonahon is developing a differential  calculus on the space of generalized curves, analogous to the  classical calculus on the space of real numbers.  This enables him  to compute derivatives for certain natu ral functions on the space  of simple closed curves and to obtain estimates on their  variations.  ***",
