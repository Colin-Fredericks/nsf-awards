 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is focused on the theory, structure and design  methods for the perfect-reconstruction (PR) /ncar-perfect-  reconstruction (NPR) filter banks and their applications in signal  conversion, detection and adaptation.  High performance filter  banks with high attenuation are needed in many applications such as  audio compression algorithms, high-bandwith high-resolution A/D  converters, wideband signal detection systems and adaptive  filtering algorithms.  The design of these filter banks are very  difficult because of the nonlinear relations between the parameters  and the objective function.  New structures and design methods will  be investigated.  They will open up new classes of filter banks,  some of which are addressed in the project.  They are the  biorthogonal cosine-modulated filter bank, the infinite-impulse-  response (IIR) cosine-modulated filter bank, and the nonuniform  filter bank.  These filter banks will be used in several  applications such as high-performance A/D converter, nondestructive  evaluation, echo cancellation and adaptive noise cancellation  systems.    The education part consists of writing an undergraduate textbook on  the theory and design methods of filter bank wavelets, establishing  an internet site for the storage of design programs and  coefficients of filter banks and developing a new course on time-  frequency and time-scale analysis.",
