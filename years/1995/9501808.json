 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  OPP-9501808    This program would provide an organized opportunity for  undergraduates in a relatively isolated geographical area to gain  research experience in environmental chemistry and biochemistry.  We have proposed a diversified approach centering around  environmental and biotechnical applications of chemistry and  biology in which students work with committed faculty.  This  research focus, spotlighting chemical and biochemical components  of environmental and ecological studies specific to high  latitudes, is appropriate for undergraduates.  Core disciplines  in chemistry and biochemistry are well represented with projects.  Research projects include environmental chemistry, molecular  evolution, bioinorganic chemistry, molecular biology of marine  organisms, and atmospheric chemistry.    The program will recruit undergraduate students who are majoring  in chemical or biological science, and encourages women and  minorities such as native Alaskans who are attending the  University of Alaska to apply.  We wish to continue our cross-  cultural approach in which Alaskan students exchange scientific  and social perspectives with students from the lower 48.  A  summer seminar series by both local faculty and visitors is  included in our program to increase the exposure of the students  to a wide range of chemistry and biochemistry.  Ethics and honor  in science discussions are also held weekly and outside speakers  will be invited.  Evening workshops on graduate school admission  and selection, as well as discussions of career opportunities  will be held.  We also will develop an improved follow-through  and tracking of students to monitor what careers the students  pursued.",
