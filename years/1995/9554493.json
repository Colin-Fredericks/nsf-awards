 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554493  Coble    The Oceanography Camp for Girls (OCG) was developed jointly by the University of South  Florida's Department of Marine Science (USF DMS) and the Pinellas County School System to  encourage career interest in the sciences for young women posed to enter high school.   Oceanography was chosen because of its inherent interdisciplinary nature, requiring a familiarity  with the four \"hard\" sciences--biology, chemistry, geology and physics, as well as a foundation  in mathematics.  As such, the camp reflects the areas of study in which women are most often  underrepresented, and allows young women to use the knowledge gained from hands-on  activities and to apply it to a tangible marine environment in their own \"backyard.\"  This  environmental \"bridging\" is accomplished via cruises aboard a research vessel for data  collection, field trips, and in-depth, practical laboratory explorations.  The uniqueness of this  educational program derives its focus, not only from real-world environmental studies and  awareness, but also from one-on-one mentoring of middle school girls by women who are  already established in scientific fields.  This project would significantly expand and refine the  camp experience.  Annually, the OCG has reached only 30 young women residing in Pinellas  County.  The target population beyond Pinellas County allows a new population of young  women residing within a six county radius to benefit from this experience.  Additional  components of the expansion and refinement of this program include:  1) modification of the  program format to accommodate a residential component, increase interactions between student  role models and camp participants; 2) addressing the numerous leaks along the education pipeline  to directly improve access and retention of women in the sciences; 3) providing teacher training  to enhance science education at secondary levels; 4) increasing collaborative efforts between  public and private research facilities statewide; and 5) serving as a m odel program for others,  offering training materials to pilot similar programs regionally.    The demonstration of the provision of services to female students includes:  a summer science  program, use of technology in instruction, technical assistance, development of a curriculum  addressing needs and interests of female students, improvement of individualized instruction in  the classroom, collaborations between secondary schools, university and governmental  organizations, and dissemination of information gathered over both short-term and long-term  review processes.  The target population for this program is young women who have  successfully completed seventh grade.  This is a critical time when girls experience a loss of  self-confidence and need positive encouragement in their pursuits of math and science.  The  rationale is that the camp experience will motivate participants to select more math and science  courses and seriously consider the sciences as a career option.  ***",
