 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to secure funding for a phosphorimager to be shared  among the members of the Center for Molecular Parasitology at Case  Western Reserve University. This group, within the Department of  Molecular Biology and Microbiology, is a newly formed division  consisting of four current (increasing to eight) principal  investigators. Each of the member laboratories is involved in research  examining different aspects of RNA processing. Briefly, this research  includes studies examining cis- and trans-splicing in nematodes, the  characterization of similarities and differences between cis- and trans  splicing systems, protein factor involvement in cis- and  trans-splicing, mechanisms of RNA editing in the slime mold, Physarum  polycephalum, developmental regulation of RNA editing in Physarum  polycephalum, molecular analysis of signal recognition particle in the  fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and splicing mechanisms and  factors in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.          As the molecular tools employed in the analysis of RNA processing  have become increasingly more sensitive, the traditional film-based  autoradiographic approach to isotope detection has become limiting. The  acquisition of a phosphorimager would allow us to gain access to new  technology that would directly impact not only our ability to perform a  majority of our experiments where signal strength is a critical issue,  but it would also allow for the Center as a whole to increase its  productivity by drastically decreasing the time required between the  performance of an experiment and the analysis of data. The system's  multi-user capabilities would be enhanced through the incorporation of  a package of peripheral equipment (detailed in the Description of  Instrumentation) aimed at maintaining the base phosphorimaging unit as  a data acquisition point with all subsequent data analysis performed at  remote, existing computer locations. This also allows for several  students, postdoctoral fellows and technicians t o analyze data  simultaneously. If funding for this equipment is provided by the NSF  through a Multi-User Biological Equipment and Instrumentation Resources  Grant, then multiple laboratory groups (presently four, but expanding  to eight) will gain access to current technology that will allow for  experiments to be conducted that otherwise would be difficult or  impossible to analyze.",
