 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses problems in in two major areas:    (1) Theorem Proving:  Automated  deduction  is being used to derive mathematical theorems   whose proofs would not  be feasible without computer  assistance. Two facets of this   research are:  1a.  Search Strategies.  This is part of a continuing  effort to   improve current  theorem proving technology.  Specific investigations involve:   generation, model generation, and linked resolution.  1b.   Specific Theorems.  New areas of application  are being sought out, and well-  known open problems  involving single axioms for groups and the Robbins  algebra   problem are being  studied.  These two facets are closely related.  Improvements   in theorem  prover  technology can be applied to proving better theorems.   Conversely, proving new  theorems gives a  way of demonstrating the power of the   technology, and failed  attempts to prove a theorem can suggest  ways in which the   technology can be  improved.   (2) Verification:  Here, one uses a computer   program to verify  existing mathematical theorems.  One goal is to develop   verification systems far  enough so that they could  be used as referees for   mathematical papers.  Concentration is on:  (a) The Boyer-Moore prover.  This works   finitistic mathematics, and is probably the best known   existing  verification  system.  The current system includes the ability to do   induction on the ordinal  epsilon_0. Extensions of this prover are being examined,  with an eye to allowing induction on larger  ordinals.  (b) A   prover for set  theory.  Within axiomatic set theory (ZFC), one can develop   all of  mathematics.  A verification system based on ZFC is being designed.  This   system will borrow  features  already used in the Boyer-Moore prover and other   systems, but major  new problems will be addressed.  One problem is how to encode   meta-rules, such  as the scheme for transfinite induction. Another is how  to   allow the user to  extend the system by adding type declarations (corresponding   to informal  mathematical statements such as ``from now on, x,y,z will   represent real  numbers'').",
