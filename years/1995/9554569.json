 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9554569  Calhoun  The present proposal seeks to  enhance the interdisciplinary  training of graduate students in  sociology, history, anthropology,  and political science to be better  able to contribute to understanding  of (a) the social conditions of  democracy (b) the nature of  transitions to democracy and their  consolidation, (c) democracy in  historical perspective, and (d)  cultural and ethnic issues in  democratic development. The UNC  Traineeship program aims  specifically to overcome the  unfortunately sharp divisions  between three major styles of work:  studies of large scale quantitative  data sets; comparative quantitative  and qualitative historical studies  and ethnographic studies of smaller  numbers of cases (including single  cases set in comparative context);  and social and political theory.  All trainees will gain competence  in all three of these major  approaches to the field. The  Traineeship program will be  centered in a two-semester  interdisciplinary course sequence  required of all trainees and  offered annually, and a proseminar  for trainees, other interested  graduate students, and faculty. All  trainees will be eligible for up to  four years of further financial  support from UNC, contingent on  satisfactory progress. Trainees  will be selected by a committee  composed of the Principal  Investigator and faculty from the  four departments. Trainees will  have the option of an international  field practicum in the summer after  their Traineeship year. Programs  are in place with the  Constitutional Commission of  Eritrea, the Ford Foundation and a  cluster of NGOs in India, and  university-based research centers  in Russia and Eastern Europe, Asia,  Africa and Latin America.",
