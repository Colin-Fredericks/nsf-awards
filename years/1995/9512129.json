 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are requesting funds for the acquisition of equipment and for  renovation of a fermentor to expand and upgrade the Fermentation  Facility at the University of Rochester. Although the Fermentation  Facility has been in operation for over 25 years, some of the equipment  has deteriorated, making it difficult and inefficient to prepare large  quantities of yeast and E. coli. The requested new equipment and the  renovation will rectify this deficiency at the University of Rochester.       The following items are requested for the Fermentation Facility: (i)  a BioFlo IV 20 liter fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Inc.);  (ii) the renovation of a 130 liter fermentor that is currently in need  of repair; (iii) a Model Z41 continuous flow centrifuge (New Brunswick  Scientific Co., Inc.); (iv) a Model 58750 sterilizer (VWR Scientific);  and (v) a Labconco Laboratory Washer (VWR Scientific).       The BioFlo IV 20 liter fermentor will partially replace and  supplement three 16 liter fermentors, purchased in 1983, that are in  constant need of repair and are inefficient to operate. The 130 liter  fermentor, purchased in 1976 (Model 1401, Fermentation Design), will be  renotated by the New Brunswick Scientific Co. The continuous flow  centrifuge is required for collection of cells. The autoclave will  replace a older model, purchased in 1969, that barely functions. The  Laboratory Washer will be used for general purposes, including washing  of glassware used for the preparation of precultures.       The total cost of the equipment for the Fermentation Facility is  $152,667; we are requesting $100,000 from NSF, and the University of  Rochester will be provide remaining $52,667.       The Fermentation Facility will be used by at least five members of  the faculty from the University of Rochester, Drs. F. Sherman, E.  Phizicky, T. Platt, A. E. Senior (Department of Biochemistry), and J.  S. Butler (Department of Microbiology & Immunology); and by Dr. G.  Mclendon, (Department of Chemistry, Universi ty of Rochester, and  Department of Chemistry, Princeton University). In addition, the  Fermentation Facility will be available to others at the University of  Rochester.       The Fermentation Facility is housed on the sixth floor of the  Medical School (room 6-5721). The Fermentation Facility will be under  the responsibility of Dr. F. Sherman and will be managed by Ms. Linda  Comfort, who is Laboratory technician working in Dr. Sherman's group.  Each research group will be responsible for operating the equipment for  their own preparations; however, if necessary, the different groups can  consult with technicians having expertise in the use of the equipment.       The Fermentation Facility will be primarily used to prepare large  quantities of normal and mutant forms of yeast and Escherichia coli  strains for a wide range of studies carried out at the University of  Rochester. The following investigators require the Fermentation  Facility to carry out the following studies: F. Sherman, amino-terminal  acetylation and post-translational processing of proteins from yeast;  G. Mclendon and F. Sherman, X-ray structures and physical studies of  mutant forms of cytochrome c of yeast; E. Phizicky, characterization of  components of the tRNA splicing reaction of yeast; T. Platt,  identification and characterization of proteins involved in 3'-end  formation of yeast mRNA; J. S. Butler, identification and  characterization of proteins involved in cleavage and polyadenylation  of yeast mRNA; and A. E. Senior, structure-function relationships of  the FlFo-ATP synthase from E. coli.       All of these studies are funded by either NIH or NSF grants, and all  are parts of projects involving graduate and post-doctoral students. In  addition, the Fermentation Facility will provide training for  undergraduate students, who are hired to operate the fermentors.",
