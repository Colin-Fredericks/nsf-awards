The educational part involves the development  of a Computing Initiative in the Materials Science and  Engineering department at MIT.  The investigator is  contributing towards the integration of the teaching of  modelling and computation in materials into both the  undergraduate and graduate curricula.  He is working with  software and hardware vendors to support this initiative and  is setting up a support structure for the instructors of the  core materials classes.  He is developing a new graduate  course on computational materials science.  The research  component develops methods used to predict phase diagrams  and defect arrangements in multi-component oxides.  This  approach makes it possible to predict defect arrangements in  oxides.  Two applications on which attention is being  focused are stabilized zirconias and order-disorder in the  pyrochlore-forming oxides.  %%%  As part of NSF's new CAREER program geared toward  academically young investigators, this project involves both  educational and research components.  The educational part  supports the development of a Computing Initiative in the  Materials Science and Engineering department at MIT.  The  investigator is contributing towards the integration of the  teaching of modelling and computation in materials into both  the undergraduate and graduate curricula.  He is working  with software and hardware vendors to support this  initiative and is setting up a support structure for the  instructors of the core materials classes.  He is developing  a new graduate course on computational materials science.  The research component develops methods used to predict  phase diagrams and defect arrangements in multi-component  oxides, which are both of scientific and technological  interest.  This approach makes it possible to predict defect  arrangements in oxides.  Such work leads to a better  understanding of the relation between composition, the rmal  treatment, and properties of a system, and therefore  ultimately to better materials.  ***",
