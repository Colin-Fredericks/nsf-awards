 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455822  Schray  A consortium of nine institutions of higher education headed by  Lehigh University is making fundamental revisions of the chemistry  curriculum at all levels for majors in chemistry, for future  professionals, scientists and engineers, for responsible citizens,  and for continuing education students.  The proposed ChemPRIME  curriculum will utilize current, high-visibility, multiple  exemplars to structure the chemistry.  Options in exemplars, depth  and rigor of treatment, learning style format, review, self-  testing, and evaluation create a flexibility made possible by CD-  ROM technology.  Students will create self-customized courses.   Ultimately a single publication will integrate all courses in the  curriculum.  The planning process involves faculty in: (1)  selection of exemplars for introductory and analytical chemistry  courses, (2) definition of basic chemistry content covered in these  exemplars, and (3) combination of exemplars into tracks through the  courses in the traditional curriculum.  The interdisciplinary  nature of many exemplars will promote the integration of chemistry  and related disciplines, while traditional core concepts will allow  reliance on the experience and training of faculty.  The ChemPRIME  curriculum will create courses of unprecedented flexibility  because: (1) different exemplars treating the same basic chemistry  will be interchangeable; (2) depth and rigor may be selected by an  instructor; (3) courses may be incrementally updated; (4) students  will select the presentation optimized for their learning style;  (5) laboratory experiences will be closely linked to exemplars; and  (6) customized courses for new constituencies may be more easily  designed and tested, broadening the impact of chemistry through the  traditional college curriculum.  Evaluation of individual  components and the overall ChemPRIME project will be readily  conducted.  Student access to the developing program through a  network will allow determination of component  use and learning  success via embedded self-testing and traditional methods.",
