 "awd_abstract_narration": "9408649  Lucas         For the first time since explicitly dynamic macroeconomic  models were first developed in the 1930s, we have available a  class of theories that are squarely in the general equilibrium  tradition; built up from assumptions on preferences, technology,  and market structure.  In the ten years since the introduction of  the first real business cycle model, a great deal of useful  theoretical and computational experience has been accumulated,  evidence from a wide range of sources has been brought to bear on  key parameters, and people have begun to apply the standard  methods of neoclassical welfare analysis to macroeconomic  questions.  These are exciting and promising technical  developments, but they have been bound together with a particular  substantive view of the nature of business cycles: that  productivity changes have been the main source of economic  instability.  As a result, macroeconomists who are convinced of  the importance of monetary shocks and nominal rigidities have  made little use of these developments.  This project addresses  the question of how to best integrate the analysis of real and  monetary forces in a general equilibrium framework with well-  specified microfoundations.         This project pursues theoretical research on the business  cycle effects of monetary instability.  A framework is proposed  for a unified treatment of the economy's response to productivity  shocks and of market malfunctions that transmit monetary  disturbances in other sectors of the economy.  The potential of  this framework in accounting for the behavior of production,  prices, and interest rates is described,  Some central questions  are identified, and a program of theoretical, numerical, and  empirical research on these question is pursued.",
