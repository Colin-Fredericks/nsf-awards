 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of new stereoselective syntheses of specifically  fluorinated molecules.  The work studies the reactivity and selectivity of various fluorinated  building blocks and how these factors are effected by the presence of fluorine.  Toward this end  the stereoselective reactivity of fluorinated ketenes, ketene equivalents or products derived from  them will be explored.  Specific aspects include a study of the reactivity of fluoroketenes in  cycloaddition reactions, preparation of fluorinated transition metal organometallic complexes as  fluoroketene surrogates, use of optically pure fluorinated beta-lactams as building blocks, use  of optically pure fluorinated cyclobutanones as intermediates, and use of fluorinated C,O-  disilylketenes as building blocks for the synthesis of fluorinated olefins.    With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. John T. Welch  of the Department of Chemistry at the SUNY Albany.  Professor Welch will focus his work on  the development of new stereoselective syntheses of specifically fluorinated molecules.  This  strategy will use the construction of reactive, functionalized fluorinated intermediates that can  undergo a variety of further stereoselective transformations.  Such systems include fluorinated  ketenes, beta-lactams and cyclobutanones.  The methodology developed will allow the synthesis  of optically pure fluorinated compounds that can be used as probes in a variety of mechanistic  and biological problems, as well as materials applications.",
