 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for research on the design and semantics of  statically-typed object-oriented programming languages.  The project has several  goals.  (1) It builds on and extends the design of the polymorphic,  statically-typed object-oriented  programming language, PolyTOIL, to provide  more power  and expressibility while retaining  type-safety. (2) It investigates  the design of an object-oriented language whose primary  relation between types  is matching rather than subtyping.  This will likely req  uire the development  of a partial type-inference system to allow the programmer to avoid  the  proliferation of bounded type parameters. (3) It seeks to create better  mathematical  (denotational) models for foundational calculi for object-oriented  languages. (4) It  investigates the development of verification  techniques for  object-oriented programming  languages. (5) It applies current knowledge of the  semantics of object-oriented languages to  the understanding  of concurrent  object-oriented languages.    These problems are being attacked using formal  specifications of type-checking rules and  operational semantics.  Subject-reduction-style theorems are being used to prove the safety  of type  systems. Interpreters are being written in order to provide a better  understanding  of the strengths and weaknesses of the systems and in order to  invetigate scaling up of theoretical designs to full-strength programming  languages.  The project seeks to  validate verification techniques by proving  the consistency of an operational and axiomatic  semantics.",
