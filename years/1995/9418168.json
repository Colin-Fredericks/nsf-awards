 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418168  Mahoney  This project will  (1) continue successful geochemical work  related to the Deccan Traps of India, and (2) investigate  the origins of the vast but enigmatic Indian Ocean mantle  domain.  Recent models attribute the Deccan event to impact  of the Reunion plume head beneath a fast-moving Greater  India; however, a study of alkalic intrusions north of the  Deccan by Basu et al.  1993  suggests that the Reunion  hotspot existed at least 3 m.y. before the main Deccan  eruptions.   Propose to analyze a collection of Parh basalts  for Nd, Pb, and Sr isotopes and ICP-MS trace elements, in  order to establish whether they are indeed early Reunion  hotspot products.  Recent investigations have shown that  modern Indian Ocean MORB, has a Pb-Nd-Sr isotopic signature  quite distinct from that of Pacific and North Atlantic MORB.  The earlier history of this immense mantle domain is  uncertain, however, and whether it originated and grew with  the breakup of Gondwana and the opening of the Indian Ocean,  or is an older feature inherited from the East Tethyan Ocean  asthenosphere is unknown.  Propose to analyze Pb, Nd, and Sr  isotopes trace elements and , where necessary, major  elements from DSDP sites in the western Indian Ocean, and  magmatic units of East Tethyan seafloor preserved in the  Masirah, Yarlung-Zangpo, and Baluchistan ophiolites in order  to answer this question.",
