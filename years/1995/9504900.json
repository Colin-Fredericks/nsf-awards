It will also attempt to find an analytic  understanding of the difference between Neumann and Dirichlet  boundary conditions for differential forms on the smooth part of a  complex projective variety.  Finally, it is planned that prior  results of the investigator and Mark Stern concerning pure Hodge  structures on the intersection cohomology of a projective variety  will be extended without recourse to the theory of D-modules.       There are many quantitative approaches to the study of curved  objects, parts of which are not smooth or even, but instead have  corners or cusps.  (Imagine a crumpled piece of metal.)  For  instance, one may ask how these cusps affect the diffusion of heat  within the object; or, conversely, whether observed properties of  the diffusion determine the nature of the cusps.  For very  complicated smooth objects (even those of more than three  dimensions), the effect of the curvature of the object on heat  diffusion within it is fairly well understood.  One goal of this  project is to extend to objects with cusps, the known analysis of  heat diffusion in smooth objects.  ***",
