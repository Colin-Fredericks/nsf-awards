 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506855  Wray    Enormous strides have been made recently towards understanding the  molecular genetic basis for body pattern development in animals.  With the breakthroughs, however, have come new questions. In  particular, the expression of many patterning genes is remarkably  conserved among morphologically distinct animals. Dr. Wray proposes  to examine the expression, function, and evolution of several  patterning genes in echinoderms, a phylum with a highly modified,  radial body organization. His analysis will focus on genes whose  expression is conserved in insects and vertebrates, but likely to  be modified in radial animals. He will first characterize their  timing, spatial domains, and transcript sizes. Genes expressed  during radial body development will be selected for a detailed  comparative analysis among phylogenetically diverse echinoderms.  These data will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of  expression changes during the origin and diversification of the  phylum. He will manipulate the timing of adult development using  environmental cues to test the hypothesis that the timing of  patterning gene expression in this phylum is not \"hardwired\".  Together, these studies will ad d considerably to our understanding  of the developmental and evolutionary significance of genes with  roles in body patterning.  ***",
