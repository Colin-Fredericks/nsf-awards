The primary objective of this project is  to increase the public's awareness of the extent, importance, and  nature of their everyday rememberings.  Exploratorium staff will  use an approach to memory, and cognition in general, that considers  culture and cultural differences as essential to people's thinking  and behavior.    The exhibit area will be about 2000 sq ft in size and will consist  of ten to twelve new activities and six revised interactive,  interdisciplinary exhibits.  Here visitors will have the  opportunity to interact with the exhibits, researchers, scientists,  artists, and other visitors, to explore the nature of memory and  its effect on their lives.  The exhibits will give visitors direct,  experiential insight into the workings of their memories.  Other  major components of the project include multimedia presentations,  printed materials, demonstrations, film programs and a symposium.   A publication Memory and Perception will be a supplemental guide  that can be used by teachers and students at the secondary level.   It will address appropriate themes in the Science Framework for  California Public Schools.  Museum professionals, researchers,  teachers, and evaluators will be invited to participate in a one-  week symposium on Cognition in Science Centers.  The purpose of the  symposium is to develop a conceptual and practical model of what  presenting cognition in an informal education setting means.  A  report will be published and broadly disseminated by professional  museum organizations.  It is estimated that the project will reach  approximately 629,000 visitors annually which includes 69,000  students and 550 teachers.",
