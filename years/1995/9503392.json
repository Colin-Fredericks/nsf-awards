The first of these problems concerns the existence and   intermediate asymptotic behavior of self-similar solutions to the porous   medium equation (a degenerate nonlinear parabolic equation) and to the   Navier-Stokes equations of gas dynamics.  The objective here is to obtain   the asymptotic description of various critical transitions in the flows   involved, such as the closing of holes (focusing) in porous medium flow   or the implosion of shock waves in gas dynamics.  The second problem   concerns the study of the dynamics of of load coupled arrays of Josephson   point junctions. These arrays are modeled by nonlinear systems of   ordinary differential equations, and the object of the study is to   understand the onset of stability and instability of various kinds of   phase locked solutions.  Particular emphasis will be placed on   predicting the loss of stability of phase lock and the dynamical   consequences of such a loss.     Self-similar solutions to partial differential equations are   solutions of a particularly simple structure determined by the underlying   symmetries of the equation.  They often arise in the asymptotic   description of critical transitions in the flow, because these   transitions are characteristic of the equations themselves and do   not depend on the details of the particular flow.  An example of this   phenomenon occurs in engineering practice in connection with coating flows   of very viscous fluids.  The process of filling holes in such flows is   often described by a porous medium equation, and our results will be   useful in developing numerical methods for the study and control of such   processes.  Large arrays of load coupled Josephson junctions are used in   many electronic devices such as  microwave generators and parametric   amplifiers.  In all these devices the most desirable operating condition   is one in which all of the junctions oscillate in unison.    Unfortunately, for various junction characteristics and load   configurations this phase locked state is not stable. It is therefore   important to know how to predict the stability and instability of the   phase locked state in terms of the parameter values for any particular array.",
