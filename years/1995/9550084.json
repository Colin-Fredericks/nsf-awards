 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simmons College  EnviroNet:  Telecommunications Across the Curriculum  This 36 month project provides training, networking and support for K-12 educators enabling them to work on cross-discipline projects.  A total of 150 teachers for 30-40 New England school systems participate in a series of training activities including introductory workshops, two-weeks of summer workshops, two-days of academic year follow-up, one week of summer workshops during the following year, and other activities.    The project is built on the expanded EnviroNet network located the college.  The school projects generally deal with monitoring the environment and have in the past included AcidRain, Ozone, BirdWatch, RoadKill, WhaleNet and others.  Each project has a leader and a scientist/agency that provides expertise.  Each participating teacher is responsible for at least one monitoring project for EnviroNet, participating in EnviroQuest, providing local contacts, and increased telecommunications activities in the school.  Participating teachers are also expected to conduct a half-day workshop for colleagues.  Five graduate students in education visit and work with the teachers during the academic year.    Cost sharing is 56%.",
