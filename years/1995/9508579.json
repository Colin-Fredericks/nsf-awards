 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many realistic image synthesis algorithms have been devised,  but unfortunately they tend to be very inefficient, often  requiring hours or  days of calculation.  As a result, the  visual cues provided by these algorithms  (shading, shadows,  transparency, reflections, etc.) still have not been used  routinely by applications requiring visualization, primarily  because they are  not supported in real-time on current  generation graphics workstations.  However, both increased  performance and greater functionality can be expected  in  future generation workstation. This research project  develops efficient  high quality image synthesis algorithms.  The project will attack several  specific areas.  Continuing  to develop the theory behind rendering so that it  has a  sound basis in physics and mathematics continuing the  development of  fast hierarchial algorithms based on wavelets  for solving the rendering  equation.  Investigating various  hybrid algorithms that combine the best  features of the finite  element and Monte Carlo approaches.  Finally investigating  various issues that result from the need to handle very  large, complex  environements.  The algorithms will be  implemented in an experimental image  synthesis system that  is being developed and they will be tested  on a variety  of  different scenes and environments.",
