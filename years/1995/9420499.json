 "awd_abstract_narration": "Imaginative use of computational mathematics can provide  insight into some of the most difficult questions about nonlinear  partial differential equations.  Among these are problems of  transonic aerodynamics and plasma physics that appear  superficially not to be well posed, but become so when weak  solutions are introduced correctly.  Numerical analysis of the  weak  solutions is a major challenge to mathematics.  The investigator  conducts research in this area of applied mathematics in  collaboration with both graduate students and postdoctoral  assistants.       This project is concerned with the numerical solution of  nonlinear partial differential equations, and the principal  results are codes that work effectively on the latest generation  of computers and have significant technological applications.  Emphasis is placed on research in high performance computing that  brings to bear on previous algorithms the advantages of parallel  architecture.  The investigator collaborates with mathematicians,  physicists and engineers, aiming at successful transfer of  technology to industry.  A principal area of study is the problem  of transport in magnetic fusion energy research.  This phenomenon  can be modeled by a Monte Carlo method that provides good  estimates of the transport.",
