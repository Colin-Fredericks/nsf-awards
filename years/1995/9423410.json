 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the continuation of an investigation of the  transport of chemical trace elements and species from source  regions through the atmosphere to the Greenland ice sheet.  Its goal is to provide information for the interpretation of  the trace element distribution in the long ice core that has  been obtained through the Greenland Ice Sheet Program (GISP-  2) drilling effort.  The ice core will provide a detailed  record spanning 200,000 years.    The project has three specific objectives: (1) the  identification of source regions and atmospheric pathways  for the chemical constituents reaching the drill site,  including the possible changes in air mass characteristics  during transit, (2) the quantification of relationships  between chemical species in the atmosphere and those in the  ice sheet, and (3) the interpretation of the deep ice core  data using this information.  Prior field work has resulted  in the collecting of samples of air, aerosol, precipitation,  and deposited snow, which will be analyzed for various  anions and cations, trace elements, carbon compounds, and  trace gases.  This project will emphasize the deposition  mechanisms.    The first objective will be achieved by measuring  concentrations of chemical species in air and snow, and then  combining this information with meteorological data of other  investigators.  Concentrations of major anions and cations  will be determined by ion chromatography in our  laboratories, while concentrations of trace elements and  other species will be obtained by collaboration with other  groups.  The second objective involves measurement of wet,  dry, and fog deposition, as well as changes that occur in  the snow pack after deposition of chemical species.  The  third objective will be achieved by developing models to  explain the processes influencing air and snow chemistry at  the site in collaboration with GISP-2 researchers who are  actively working with the core data.  The results will be a  better interpretation of the ice c ore data, and the  reduction of uncertainties involved in using the core data  to determine past atmospheric conditions.  ***",
