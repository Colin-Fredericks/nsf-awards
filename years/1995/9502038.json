 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded through the Faculty Early Career Development   (CAREER) Program  of the Chemistry Division, Professor Susan Graul  of   the Department of Chemistry of the Carnegie- Mellon University will study   the thermochemistry, kinetics, and dynamics of gas-phase ion-molecule   reactions.  Reaction cross sections and product angular and energy   distributions will be determined using mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy   spectrometry and guided ion-beam techniques.  Initial studies will focus   on the exothermic bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reactions   of methyl halides CH3X (X=Cl,Br,I) with F- and Cl- ions.  These studies   will be extended to other systems such as the reactions of F- and Cl-   ions with chloroacetonitrile and bromoacetonitrile, and others.    Furthermore, bimolecular elimination reactions will also be investigated.    These experimental studies will be complemented by electronic structure   calculations for relevant reaction intermediates and transition states,   and statistical theoretical modeling of the reactions studied for   comparison with experimental results.  Accompanying the research activity   is a specified education effort appropriate to the development of a full,   balanced, academic career.   The chemistry of ion-molecule reactions is at the forefront of gas phase   reaction chemistry.  As such it plays an important role in the chemistry   of combustion processes, the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, and other   areas. This research will contribute to our understanding of these   processes by providing data suitable for the development of advanced   theoretical, molecular based  models of chemical reactions.",
