 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421847  Fovell        Thunderstorms are of interest because of both the severe weather and the beneficial rainfall that they  produce.  A certain class of thunderstorms, known as multicellular storms, are very common in the Spring/Summer  months and typically are not severe, but bring much needed rainfall.  As their name implies, these storms are  composed of a sequence of individual updrafts ( cells ) and their concomitant precipitation.        While much have been learned about the behavior of multicellular storms, a few fundamental problems still  remain.  One such problem is that the factors that control the periodicity of cell formation and their temporal  behavior have never been determined.  Using an advanced numerical model, the Principal Investigator will attack  this problem.  Additionally, he will investigate how these storm modify their upstream conditions and, hence,  potentially the future evolution of the storm.        A third area of investigation is to study the structure and evolution of sea-breeze fronts and their role in  convective initiation.  While on the surface sea-breeze fronts and multicellular storms are quite different, they do  share dynamic similarities that make these studies related.        If successful, this research will lead to much improved understanding of the underlying dynamics of the  ubiquitous multicellular thunderstorms.  ***",
