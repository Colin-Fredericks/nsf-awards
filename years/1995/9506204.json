The viruses to be  studied include three tobamoviruses, odontoglossum ringspot virus  (ORSV), ribgrass mosaic virus (RMV) and sunn-hemp mosaic virus  (SHMV), and one furovirus, soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV).   Structures of the three tobamoviruses will be determined by  molecular replacement, using the known structure of TMV.  The  structure of SBWMV will be determined using the methods of multi-  dimensional isomorphous replacement developed in this laboratory.  All structures will be refined using molecular dynamics methods, as  adapted in this laboratory for use with fiber diffraction data.   These refinement methods will be developed further.  The  tobamovirus group is the only rod-shaped virus group for which  three-dimensional structures have been determined at the molecular  level.  The structures to be determined will be important in  understanding the molecular characteristics of the group, including  the relationship between subgroups, and will advance understanding  of viral assembly and disassembly, viral-host interactions and  specificity, and vector transmission, as well as the relationship  between structure and the rapid evolution of RNA viruses.    %%%  The structures of a number of rod-shaped plant viruses will be  determined in molecular detail, using the fiber diffraction methods  already used in this laboratory for several viruses of the  tobamovirus.
