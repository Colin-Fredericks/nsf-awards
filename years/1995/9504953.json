Homotopy algorithms for solving sparse polynomial systems           Recently, it has been proved that modeling the sparse structure of a  polynomial system by its Newton polytopes leads to a major computational  breakthrough in solving polynomial systems by homotopy methods. The PI\u0131s \"random product homotopy\" approach proposed in the project intends to construct a start system for the homotopy in random product form with its Newton polytopes  containing those of the target system. On the other hand, the \"polyhedral  homotopy\" based on an elegant formula for computing the mixed volume can find all zeros of a polynomial system by following much fewer, in most occasions  the exact amount of, homotopy curves.             Polynomial Systems occur everywhere in Mathematics, Science and  Technology. Very small systems are easily solved by hand, but larger systems cannot reliably be so solved, if at all. The project aims to implement a portable solver using the latest in polynomial system solving algorithms and  capable of being incorporated into applications programs. Research will be  carried out to advance the state of the art and our understanding of polynomial  systems; additionally, various application areas will be studied, such as  kinematics, control theory, geometric modelling, and biochemistry in  which problems reducible to polynomial system solving arise.",
