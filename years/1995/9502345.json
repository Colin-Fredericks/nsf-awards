 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will create operating system support and a  programming  environment for developing and maintaining long-running  parallel  and  distributed applications that are continually evolving, such  as automated  manufacturing and scientific computation. Supporting changes  at runtime  requires an efficient, dynamic reconfiguration  facility and  an extensible  programming environment.  The scope of the research includes  building  toolkit  at the system level, end-user environment for  developing  applications  including algorithm design, prototyping, and  evaluation of the  efficiency and  usefulness of the facility. The toolkit will  utilize  partial-order semantics  and is based on the  hierarchical  state machine  formalism. The programming  environment is based on a  scalable software  architecture for specifying and  verifying application  behavior.    The educational component of the CAREER  project will develop  advanced and  introductory courses, and computer  laboratories on parallel  processing.  These developments, present  effective  venue for providing  advanced  education and research training to graduate and  undergraduate minority  students and equipping them to meet challenges in a  world  that is  increasingly dependent on distributed computer systems.",
