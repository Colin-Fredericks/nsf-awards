The purpose of the meeting is the presentation and discussion of recent developments in the endocrinology of the juvenile hormones (JH) which regulate growth, development, and reproduction in the insects.  The following topics will be discussed:  1) the evolution of juvenile hormones; 2) JH biosynthesis and metabolism; 3) regulation of transport by JH; 4) regulation of JH production; 5) JH receptors on cells; 6) mode of action and JH-regulated genes; 7) the role of JH in reproduction; 8) new technology in JH research; and 9) recent developments in applied research.  In addition to feature lectures, there will be shorter talks and poster sessions.  The proceedings of the meeting will be published in a double volume of Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology.   This is traditionally a small meeting, with its 80-100 participants coming from the United States, Canada, Europe, Israel, India, China and Japan.  Principal speakers to head each session are chosen from the registrants, with additional speakers and poster presenters chosen on the basis of submitted abstracts.  Participation of students and post-doctoral fellows has always been encouraged.  This conference is unique in its focus and draws scientists working in many different basic and applied scientific disciplines for discussions of the research progress in very important aspects of insect growth and development.  ***",
