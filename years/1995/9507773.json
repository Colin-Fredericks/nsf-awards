Although research has  provided much information on the early development of physical  knowledge, and in particular how infants perceive, explore, and  act on objects, little is known regarding what they perceive of  their own body and how they develop an understanding of their own  physical actions.  Considering that the body is a primary object  of knowledge, self-exploratory behavior in infancy is an  essential aspect of early cognition.  This research will  investigate self-exploration and the perception of self-produced  movements in infants between birth and 6 months.  In the course  of the first six months, infants spend much of their waking hours  exploring their own body, bringing hand(s) to the mouth and in  the  field of view for long bouts of inspection.  Questions  remain as to what determines such behavior and what kind of  perceptual information young infants pick up when engaging in  self-exploration.  This research will examine what perceptual  information young infants are sensitive to and are capable of  detecting while engaging in self-exploratory behavior.  In  particular, the focus will be on the early development of the  capacity to perceive self-produced movements.  A first experiment  will investigate the early capacity to discriminate tactile and  proprioceptive information specifying either self- or non-self-  produced stimulation by neonates, 1-, and 2-month-old infants.   Five other experiments will investigate what 2- to 6-month-old  infants perceive while engaging in the exploration of self-  produced movements.  In particular, these experiments will  document the early development of the perceptual ability to  discriminate between different levels of congruence of  proprioceptive, auditory, or visual feedback accompanying self-  produced movements.  In general, this research wil l provide new  empirical data on the origins of knowledge about the body and  self-produced actions, a fundamental aspect of human perception  and cognition.  It will provide information on the importance of  self-exploration and self-initiated action in perceptual   development, and in particular in the process of discovering the  body and its effectivities.  The collected data will be  potentially useful for the assessment and prevention of hindered  perceptual and cognitive development in children lacking  opportunities for self-exploration and self-initiated actions due  to physical or mental handicaps.    ***",
