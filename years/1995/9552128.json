 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry, the Department of Geography,  Geology, and Planning, and the Department of Biology are  collaborating on an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission  spectrometry (ICP-AES) system.   ICP-AES is a widely used  analytical technique that provides measurement of elemental  composition for many types of sample, including metals and  alloys; geological samples including minerals, rocks, ores, and  soil; water, including groundwater, seawater, and waste water;  and agricultural and biological materials.   The ICP-AES system  is being used primarily for upper-level laboratory courses and  undergraduate research.   Within the Department of Chemistry,  ICP-AES is being employed in instrumental analysis courses to  determine alloy composition and in an environmental chemistry  laboratory course to determine the quantities of heavy metal  levels in field studies of contaminated soil.   In the Department  of Geography, Geology, and Planning, ICP-AES is being used in a  mineralogy course to determine the elemental composition of  minerals, in a hydrology course to measure metal content in  ground water, and in a geochemistry field study project to  measure heavy metal contaminants in the land and streams near  landfills.   In the Department of Biology, ICP-AES is being used  to determine metal concentrations in plants and in freshwater  ecosystems.   The ICP-AES system can also be employed in a  variety of undergraduate environmental research projects aimed at  evaluating the fate of heavy metals contaminants which enter  streams, the levels and distribution of toxic metals in  environmental samples, and levels of industrial pollutants on air  quality.",
