 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523509  Sheble    The Extended Brokerage System (EBS) is a multiple timed period,  multiple commodity implementation of previous research and  development of an electric market exchange.  The present  evaluation of transactions occurs only as a direct sale of  electric production beyond schedule capacity.  The EBS is  directed at evaluation of transactions beyond present schedule  techniques to increase the economic benefit of transactions   between utilities and independent power producers beyond electric  sale only.  The possibility of selling the raw materials is  included if a more economic solution can be found.  The bids for  potential transactions are not based on unit schedules but on a  market assessment of the price of electricity either in product  form or as a raw material (e.g.coal, oil, natural gas).  The net  result should b increased usage of the transmission grid across  the country and a decrease in the cost of electricity to the  consumer.    The EBS is appropriate if the industry is reorganized  horizontally or if some form of the present vertical integration  is maintained.  Since the focus of the on-going deregulation is  to price electricity as any other market commodity, the  development of an electric market place (EBS) is very timely  research and development activity to provide the foundation for  an efficient and comparably fair pricing mechanism.  Only through  open markets can a true price discovery process function to find  the optimal schedule given all constraints and all resources as  outlined in the proposal.   ***",
