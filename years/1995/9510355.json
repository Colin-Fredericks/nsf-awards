Issues that will be studied  include:  (1)  Kondo  impurity  vs  Coulomb blockade in disordered  hopping  and  tunneling  systems, (2) statistics of localized states  and  noise  in  correlated  insulators, (3) lineshape of resonance peaks in correlated  insulators,  (4) direct measurement of resonant tunneling and  hopping  conduction  via  two  different paths, (5) Hall effects  and  magnetic  field  driven metal-insulator transitions in Kondo systems, (6) length  scales  associated with quantum interference in correlated insulators.  The   experiments  will  comprise  linear  and  non-linear   transport  meassurements   in  zero  magnetic  field  and  in   non-zero   field.  Equilibrium  and shot noise experiments will be analyzed in  terms  of  recent  theoretical  developments about  noise  and  the  response  of  correlated  systems  to  shed new light on the problem  of  correlated  electron transport in quantum insulators.  %%%  During the period of this award,  recently discovered behavior in very  short   transistors  that  cannot  be  understood  in  terms  of   the  conventional physics of electronic devices will be explored through  a  variety  of  experiments.  The research will be centered on electronic  quantum  transport (discrete moverment of electrons) in submicron-size  silicon  transistors (one micron =  40 millionths of  an  inch).   One  focus  of  this  effort will be nonlinear effects (the  quality  which  gives  any  transistor  the  ability  to  amplify),  which  are   also  significant for a wide variety of applications.  This research project  will  be a university-industry collaboration among three institutions:  the measurements will be performed at the City College of CUNY and the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the transistors  will  be fabricated at t he IBM T. J. Watson Research Center.  ***",
