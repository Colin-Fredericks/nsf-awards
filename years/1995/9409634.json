 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is develop economic models for  analyzing the design of securities, considering the roles of  market liquidity, security ratings, credit enhancement, and the  distribution of information across investor groups.  Among the  questions to be addressed are: What is the role of security  rating agencies in mitigating the costs of illiquidity, and how  is security design affected by that role?  Is there a useful role  for rating agencies beyond the traditional role of evaluating  default risk?  Do informational asymmetries and other  distinctions among investor groups cause clientele effects in  security design?  The results of this project are intended to  further our understanding of how security market innovation and  rating are affected by information held asymmetrically among  issuers, underwriters, broker-dealers, and groups of investors.   The project may also include results that in will assist security  issuers, underwriters and rating agencies in the efficient  conduct of their businesses.  In addition, the research may also  uncover welfare implications that will be useful to decision-  makers in formulating regulations regarding the use of security  ratings.",
