 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of a long-term program to improve applied  optics teaching and research in the Physics Department.   This  project improves introductory and intermediate lectures and labs  and, also, undergraduate research opportunities.   The first  project goal is to improve instruction in the many courses  involving light spectra through the purchase of a portable  user-friendly rapid-scan spectroscope.   A computer display or  LCD projector makes each spectrum visible to classes of up to 80  students.   In elementary and intermediate course lectures and  labs, sunlight, tungsten and fluorescent lamps, laser sources,  and gas tube sources can be quickly compared.   Filters can be  examined, including UV absorption by clear glass versus clear  plastic versus sunglasses, for example.   For intermediate to  advanced project and research work by physics majors,  holographically formed filters can be characterized, gas-tube  spectra measured, and emission, absorption, and reflection by  solids studied.   This experience lays the foundation for some  physics students to participate in a new research lab emphasizing  spectroscopy of semiconductor surfaces that has been established  in the Physics Department.   A second project goal is to  strengthen the department's capabilities in electronically based  interferometry.   Two existing student and faculty research  programs, one on holographically based measurement of surface  roughness using scattered laser light and the other on  holographic interferometry applied to musical acoustics are   strengthened by the introduction of electronic fringe  measurement.   A computer-interfaced CCD camera is obtained for  this part of the project along with the upgrade of an optical  table used both for course work and for musical acoustics  research.",
