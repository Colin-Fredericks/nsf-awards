 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks a theoretical foundation for specifying  and  verifying object-oriented programs, and a practical foundation  for the use  of formal methods with the programming language, C++.    The project is  extending the model theory and proof theory of  abstract data types to help  characterize when one abstract data  type is a behavioral subtype of another.  Previous work has given  sufficient conditions for behavioral subtyping among  abstract  data types with immutable objects.  These conditions are based on  type specifications, as reflected in algebraic models of these  specifications.  Behavioral subtyping allows modular  specification and verification of programs,  using static type  information without using case analysis for each subtype.  Separately, one proves that the subtype relationships satisfy the  semantic  conditions of behavioral subtyping.    An important problem is to find necessary  and sufficient  conditions for behavioral subtyping for abstract types whose  objects have time-varying state (i.e., that are mutable), since  these types  occur frequently in practice.  Needed are ways to  prove behavioral subtype  relationships from type specifications.  This research would  extend the work on  modular specification and  verification to languages with mutation and  non-determinism.    The practical work is aimed at providing the fast-growing  community of C++ programmers with a foundation for the use of  formal methods  with this language. Essential to systematic  development of code, program  verification, code reuse, and other  formal development activities, is a formal  specification  language.  This project advances Larch/C++, and interface  specification language tailored to specify C++ modules.  Tools,  including a  type-checker for Larch/C++,  are being developed, as  are a suite of teaching  materials, and tutorial and larger worked  examples.",
