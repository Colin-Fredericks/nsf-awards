The finely-  laminated sediments in these lakes preserve an exceptional record  of high-resolution lake-level variations over the last 10,000 to  13,000 years, possibly the most complete and detailed Holocene  paleoclimatic record within the Indian Monsoon region.  The lakes   lie in the arid/semiarid Thar Desert at the boundary of the region  dominated by summer monsoon rainfall (Singh et al., 1990), and are  thus particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the strength of the  monsoon.  Analysis of these lacustrine records will address   how  the decadal-scale variations in the monsoon respond to longer-term  shifts in the monsoon paleoclimate, providing a high-resolution  record that covers a sufficiently long time scale to fully capture  the natural range of variability in the monsoon system, information  that is essential for understanding near-term future climatic  variations in the monsoon region.  This is a collaborative project between researchers at Central  Washington University and the of University of Arizona (see  accompanying proposal).  The methodology involves reconstructing  decade- to century-scale changes in lake levels, salinity, and  sediment influx in three shallow, closed-basin lakes through a  combination of (1) detailed stratigraphy and sedimentology of  finely laminated sediments, (2) evaporite and clay mineralogy, and  (3) radiocarbon dating.  Potential application of microfauna, trace  elements, stable isotopes and pollen toward this problem will be  explored and tested, but will not be a main focus of the study.   These data, along with modern data on precipitation, water-table  elevations , evaporation, and temperature, will be used to  construct hydrological lake-budget models and quantify th e changes   in hydrologic and climatic parameters necessary to produce the lake  fluctuations.  The analyses will concentrate on the high-resolution  variations preserved in the primary stratigraphy during extended  periods of high, low , and transitional lake-level conditions.  We  will emphasize specific periods of interest, including (a)  internals of high variability  and changing conditions, such as  wet-dry transitions, (b) short-lived, shallow lakes in the late  Holocene that reflect minor climatic fluctuations and/or extreme  events in the last 4000 years and (c) periods of particularly high  (e.g. 4000-6000 BP) or low lake levels.  Analysis of the high-  resolution paleohydrological variations will add a new dimension to  broader-scale reconstructions of Holocene paleoclimates in  monsoonal regions of India, Asia and Africa.",
