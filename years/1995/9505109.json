Previous research  by Jacquier, Polson and Rossi (1994) has shown that this methodology is   better than the usual statistical methods, such as generalized methods of   moments, for the case of normal univariate stochastic variance. This research  utilizes Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques and hierarchical modeling to  construct and implement a methodology for inference which incorporates  multivariate stochastic variance and nonnormality. Within this methodology,  it is straightforward to examine the effects of alternative assumptions  such as different error distributions on the resulting inferences. In addition,  the project develops an outlier diagnostic procedure to be used in the presence  of stochastic variance.      This research develops a general methodology for analyzing time series data,   such as stock prices, interest rates and other financial series, where variance,   or volatility, changes over time. Until recently, such data were analyzed assuming  either constant variance or variance changing according to a predetermined pattern.  Recent statistical work has shown that a better way of analyzing these data is to   assume randomly changing variance. This approach is known as stochastic variance   (or volatility) time series  modeling. This research provides a more general  framework for analyzing these models which does not rely on the usual limiting  assumptions of existing methodologies. A number of statistical tools are provided to   analyze the data within the stochastic variance framework. The methodology developed  in this research presents an improved way to analyze time series data, and severa l  examples based on financial time series are included.",
