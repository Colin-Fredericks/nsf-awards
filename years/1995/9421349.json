 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421349  Rollins-Smith    Metamorphosis in the South African clawed frog, Xenopus  laevis, results in significant changes in the immune system.  It is characterized by a striking involution of the thymus  and spleen followed by significant lymphocyte expansion in  the postmetamorphic period.  Thymus involution is observed  seasonally in some other amphibian and reptilian species,  and with aging in a number of vertebrate species.  In most  of these examples of thymus involution, the causes are not  well defined.  Corticosteroid hormones (CH) have been  implicated, but careful studies with physiological  concentrations of natural hormones and specific hormone-  receptor antagonists have not been done.  To determine  whether CH are responsible for thymus involution and the  decline in numbers of lymphocytes at metamorphosis in  Xenopus, two specific CH receptor antagonists will be  tested.  In vitro studies will establish the effectiveness  of these compounds in this system and determine effective  concentration ranges.  In vivo studies are designed to  inhibit binding of CH to their receptors and thus inhibit  possible steroid-induced cell death.  The likely mechanism of CH-induced cell death is programmed  cell death or apoptosis.  To examine this question, the  rates of spontaneous apoptosis in the thymus and spleen cell  populations of control frogs and frogs treated with CH-  antagonists will be determined at several stages before,  during, and after metamorphosis.  If CH-induced apoptosis is  a mechanism of cell decline, it should be inhibited by the  CH-antagonists.  If the decline in thymocyte and splenocyte  numbers in not due to CH-induced apoptosis, it may be due to  a decreased rate of precursor immigration and expansion  during metamorphic climax.  To examine this question, the  rate of immigration and expansion of diploid (2N) precursors  into an implanted triploid (3N) thymus will be studied at  climax and compared with that observed at premetamorphic and  postmetamorphic stages.  C ollectively, these studies will  more precisely define the dynamics of cell death and  replacement in the thymus at metamorphosis.  Survival of young postmetamorphic frogs might depend on  their ability to mount a memory response to a pathogen  encountered as a tadpole.  Therefore, we would like to know  to what extent tadpole lymphocyted persist in the  postmetamorphic period.  Tadpole T cells differ  phenotypically from T cells because they do not express  class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens.  Several experiments are designed to learn whether tadpole T  cells persist through metamorphosis and retain their tadpole  phenotype or become adult-like and express class II MHC.  %%%  These experiments will provide information about the  regulation of the immune system during development as well  as the role of corticosterid hormones in programmed cell  death  ***",
