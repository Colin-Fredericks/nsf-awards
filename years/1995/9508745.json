 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing and evaluating new techniques  for tool-assisted restructuring of large systems.  The excessive cost of  software evolution is due in large part to  inappropriate structure of a system,  relative to the changes taking place.  Tool-assisted program restructuring is studied for changing a system's structure at lower cost and risk than  making  changes  by hand.  In this approach, a tool user selects transformations  to apply to chosen program components.  The tool checks to make sure that each  transformation will preserve the functional behavior of the program.  If so, it  performs the transformation to the chosen component and updates any related  components to preserve consistency.    Tool-assisted restructuring has not been  demonstrated to be practical in industrial-scale applications.  For  example, exhaustive interprocedural data flow analysis is required by some  tools, but is costly to perform on large programs. Previous restructuring  research has not addressed common complicating constructs such as pointer  arithmetic, function pointers, comments, textual macros, and conditional  compilation.    To make the restructuring of large programs practical, this  project is developing and adapting techniques to address these problems.  Demand-driven data flow is being investigated to overcome many performance  problems of exhaustive data flow analysis. Query prioritization and caching of  replies are studied to minimize burdensome and potentially incorrect user  queries. Testing and semantic differencing may also provide checks of  correctness after restructuring.  A case study is intended to  evaluate the  techniques developed and the benefits of large-scale  restructuring.",
