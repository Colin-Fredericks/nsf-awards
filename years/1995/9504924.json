Included in these       comparisons is the naive (uncorrected) least squares estimator that       ignores measurement error.  Emphasis is placed on bias correction that       makes use of knowledge about the repeatability (reliability) of the       vector of measurements on the predictors to \"correct the slope       estimates for attenuation.\"  Various ways of obtaining and analyzing       information concerning the reliability of the vector of measured       predictors are considered, including the use of reliability studies of       individual components and/or subvectors of the predictor vector and       the elicitation and use of expert opinion.  These separate sources of       information are combined to yield frequentist or Bayes point       estimators of the reliability matrix of the measured predictors; this       matrix is used to correct least squares regression slopes for       attenuation.  Methods for forming confidence (or credible) intervals       for slopes, and also for components of the reliability matrix are       derived and compared.  Computational algorithms for finding       likelihoods and posterior distributions in both these problems, and       also in multivariate growth curve and seemingly unrelated regression       models, are written and tested on real and simulated data.     Much of scientific research concerning complex systems or organisms is       concerned with relationships among quantities .  For example, the       number of successfully hatched eggs of a certain species of marshland       wildfowl might be related to the concentrations of one or  more pesticides       in the marsh. When the rates of response or change of a variable (such as        the number of successfully hatched eggs) to changes in other predictor        variables (such as various pesticide concentrations) are estimated by       conventional statistical methods, it is assumed that the predictor        variables are measured exactly. Unfortunately, environmental, biological        or psychological variables rarely are measured exactly.  If predictor       variables are measured with error, the conventional estimates of response        rates are biased. To correct for such bias, errors-in-variables regression       models assume that each measurement is the sums of the true value of the        quantity being measured and a random error.  In this case, the proportion        of the unit-to-unit variability of a measurement that is due to the       variability over units of the true value, called the reliability of the       measurement, can be used to correct the bias of the conventional estimates        of response rates. When several variables are simultaneously used as        predictors of another,  more than the reliability of each individual       predictor is  required for this purpose; it is the reliability of the       measurements of  the predictors as a whole, or ensemble, that must be        ascertained. Because the particular collection of predictors may not have       been used before,  information about the reliability of the predictors as       an ensemble must be pieced  together from a variety of sources. The       investigator's research is  concerned with how best to obtain and combine       information from data summaries of prior studies that used some (but not       necessarily all) of the predictor variable, data from the current study        and expert opinion to obtain the required reliability information and        correct bias in the conventional estimates of response rates. Also studied        are ways to determine and summarize the accuracy of  the resulting        estimates. Insights and methodology from this research has broad        applicability to questions of combining information from several small       studies concerning the interrelationships among variables, not all of        which appear in every study. One of the products of the research is        computer software that allows information to be combined from several       studies on the same subjects (or environmental locations) and then       displayed so as to give the relative likelihoods of various statistical       models in the light of the evidence presented by the data itself.",
