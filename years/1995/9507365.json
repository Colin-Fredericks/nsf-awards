However, several observations suggest that  breeding opportunities are limited for males.  Some males  don't breed, but instead  help feed nestlings at their parents' nests.  Others fill  vacancies at nests of widowed females and care for  young  that were presumably sired by the female's former mate; the  presumed benefit of this apparent altruism is the  opportunity to breed with the female the next time around.  Superimposed on this variation in the reproductive options  of males, breeding males vary in the extent to which they  fertilize eggs of their social mates; DNA fingerprinting has  revealed that over one-third of nests have at least one  offspring that is not sired by the caregiving male. Dr.  Dickinson will use single-locus fingerprinting techniques  and field experiments to discover the processes underlying  extrapair fertilization and to measure accurately the  fitness consequences for breeders, helpers, and adoptive  males.   Through large-scale genotyping of the population  using mini- and micro-satellite DNA fingerprinting  techniques, she will characterize males successful in  fertilization.    Understanding the unusual array of alternative reproductive  behaviors in this species will provide substantial insights  into the evolution of monogamy, biparental care, and  cooperative breeding.  Dr. Dickinson will train three  undergraduate or recently graduated biology majors in field  ornithology.  In the past, a high proportion of trainees  have gone on to other jobs in field biology or, in  most  cases, graduate programs in animal behavior or ornithology.  The results of these basic studies  are likely to yield  significant information concerning the population and  conservation biology of avian species.",
