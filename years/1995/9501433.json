 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9501433 Truskinovsky  For solid materials undergoing  martensitic phase transformations,  the system of conservation  laws is of the mixed type. It has recently  become clear that  additional constitutive information is required to  close this  system of equations and to describe phenomena like  nucleation,  kinetics of phase boundaries, reconnection of phase  boundaries  and formation of finite scale microstructures. We propose  three  alternative ways to regularize the classical elastodynamics for   materials supporting seteral phases in order to derive rather  than  postulate the missing conditions. The regularization  involves high  derivatives, additional variables and/ or  consideration of discrete  system.   Large strains observed in  smart materials are produced by the  coordinated migration of the  glissile interfaces in processes such as  martensitic phase  transformations, deformation twinning or  electromagnetic domain  switching. A knowledge of the evolution of  the mobile  microstructure, and the way in which it can influence   macroscopic properties, forms the basis of any attempt to control   mechanical properties through materials selection and  metallurgical  processing. We address the foremost open problem  which concerns  the history and rate sensitivity in the  constitutive structure for  smart materials through the  description of the internal structure of  the dissipative phase  boundaries.",
