 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radial basis function neural networks provide an attractive model  for high  dimensional nonparametric estimation, particularly for  model-based process  control.  They are faster to train than conventional feedforward  networks  with sigmoidal activation functions , and provide a model  structure better  suited for adaptive control.   Radial basis function neural  networks can be  viewed as a mixture model where the number of components is  chosen  adaptively.  This view allows for statistical analysis and the  extension of current  radial basis function networks.  In particular,  this research  will  develop    models using combinations of local linear models,  invert the  models for  calibration, estimate the local prediction errors,  identify  outliers or  novel data points, adaptively choose the number of basis  functions and  derive algorithms that learn incrementally.     The research extends and improves a certain class of artificial  neural  networks, the radial basis function networks,  for applications  to  (chemical) process control.  Algorithms developed  will  be written so  they can be efficiently updated for use in on-line  process  control applications.   This is a coordinated project between two  investigators, a statistician and a chemical engineer.      A major chemical company, DuPont,  has expressed strong  interest in using these methods and they have supplied data to  test the  methodology of this research .",
