 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Practical and Professional Ethics, in collaboration with the Poynter Center for the Study of Ethics and American Institutions, and Association members who are leading scholars and educators in the ethics of scientific research, will provide instruction in ethical issues in scientific research for a selected group of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in engineering and the natural and physical sciences.  The objective is to equip these researchers with skill in ethical thinking, understanding of the historical context of scientific misconduct and awareness of the multidisciplinary nature of major issues in scientific research.  An intensive four day workshop will provide 15 participants  in each of three years with tools for self-directed development in these areas and a network of support.   The workshop will introduce participants to ethical theory and reasoning in the context of discussions on topics such as data sharing and ownership; responsible conduct of research; conflicts of interest; professional relations with colleagues; ethical issues in computing; protection of human subjects; variations in standards of conduct; responsibilities of engineers and scientists to the larger society. The aim is to enable them to provide leadership in ethical issues in the scientific community and enhanced ethics education for their own future students.   Participants will be nominated by science and engineering faculty at research universities and through solicitations to a wide variety of professional associations, and selected for their promise as leaders and mentors.   In advance of the workshop, they will begin to read historical cases and introductory material, to inform themselves of standards of conduct in their own fields,  and to develop a case study for distribution and comment.  During the workshop, participants will discuss presentations and case studies,  continue to work on their own cases and those contributed by others, and review and evaluate standards of conduct.  Case studies prepared in the workshop will be made available to faculty nationwide for use in their own courses, and participants will be expected to share their work at their home institutions.  They will join a network of concerned scientists and engineers from the Big Ten and other universities and receive a complementary three year membership in the Association which will enable them to maintain the contacts needed to continue to work in the field.  Project staff and an outside evaluator will assess the project.",
