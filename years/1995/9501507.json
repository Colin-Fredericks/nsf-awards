 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501507  Knyazev    This project will study preconditioned iterative methods for  computing   several extreme eigenpairs of generalized eigenvalue problems,  with very   large symmetric matrices.  Such problems are of major importance  in many   grand challenge scientific and engineering applications:  structural dynamics   and buckling, ocean modeling, quantum chemistry, and    magnetohydrodynamics. They arise typically from the  discretization of   continuous models, described by systems of partial differential  equations.   Matrices may be so large that the standard numerical methods  become   unsatisfactory and cannot be implemented even on the most  powerful   modern supercomputers as they are too slow or require too much  memory.    Preconditioned iterative methods were specially designed for  problems of   that kind and now they are well understood for solving large  ill-conditioned   linear algebraic systems of equations. For eigenproblems the  theory is still   poor, and these methods are rarely used. Ideally, the methods  would   compute well-separated clusters of eigenvalues and corresponding   eigenspaces at the same order of computational cost as that for  solution of   the corresponding linear algebraic system. Such processes can be  effective   and  parallelizable. Domain decomposition and iterative  substructuring   methods are  particularly promising.    The ultimate goal of the research is to develop a complete theory  of the   preconditioned methods now known for symmetric eigenproblems and  to   find new fast, accurate, and robust iterative methods. This would  provide a   basis for the development of advanced software and algorithms on  high   performance parallel computing systems. It is expected that a  research   monograph on preconditioned iterative methods for large symmetric    eigenvalue problems will be prepared to summarize the results of  the   project.",
