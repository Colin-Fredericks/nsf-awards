 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9520484  Wilson    This award supports a three year collaboration between Clark  Wilson, Geological Sciences Department, University of Texas  at Austin, and Li Zhengxin, Shanghai Observatory of the  Chinese Academy of Sciences, on optical astromeric  observations as measures of global change. The project  involves use of optical astromeric observations of latitude  to investigate whether such measurements provide useful  measures of climate variability. Shanghai Observatory has  been designated as the international repository and analysis  center for these optical records, and analysis of the data  by Professor Li has revealed intriguing fluctuations which  appear correlated with recognized climate variations such as  the El Nino/Southern Oscillation.    The collaboration will combine the unique Shanghai optical  astrometry data collection and the experience of Professor  Li with the geophysical, computational and climate data  resources at the University of Texas at Austin. The  objectives of the proposed research are to determine whether  there is a physical basis to account for apparent  correlations between climate change and optical astromeric  data, and to interpret historical optical and climaterelated  time series in light of such physical relationships.  Although space geodesy has replaced less accurate optical  astrometry in monitoring the rotation of the earth, the  optical data of the past remain of considerable value. These  data are especially useful when combined to form a polar  motion time series for the pre-space geodetic period,  because it has been shown that polar motion measures global  properties of the distribution of air and water over the  past century when few climate-related observations are  available.      ***",
