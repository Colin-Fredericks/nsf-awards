 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510449  Looze    This proposal is in response to the Grant Opportunities for  Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program.  The goal of the  proposed project is to provide the opportunity for the Principal  Investigator and a graduate student to closely work with Adaptive  Optics Associates (including on-site interaction and laboratory  work with technical staff members) to develop, test and implement  control algorithms for an adaptive optics system for astronomy.   This will be the first operational adaptive optics system outside  the U.S. Air Force.  The development of control algorithms for  the adaptive optics system will require applying modern  multivariable control techniques to a large dimensional (97  inputs, 240 outputs, and as many as 300 plant states), practical  problem which exhibits significant uncertainties and  nonlinearities.  In addition, implementation issues such as the  computational time for the control algorithm and continued  operation when measurements are degraded or missing must be  considered.  Thus, this is an opportunity to test multivariable  control system identification, analysis and design techniques on  a large, real problem.  In accordance with the guidelines of this  program, Adaptive Optics Associates  has made a commitment of  $10,000 (non-federal funds) to support this effort.  ***",
