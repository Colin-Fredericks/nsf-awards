 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417020  Perry    This award will support the participation of twelve U. S.  investigators to take part in a workshop in the area of high  performance, wear resistant films. The meeting will be held  in Sydney, Australia in February 1995. The American coordinator  is Dr. Anthony J. Perry, Director for Research and Technology   at ISM Technologies, Inc. located in San Diego, California.   The Australian organizer is Dr. Philip J. Martin, Research  Scientist with the Surface Engineering Group at the CSIRO  National Measurement Laboratory in Sydney. The workshop is  being conducted under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science  Program and support in Australia is provided through the  Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST).    Hard films made by Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) improve both  wear and corrosion resistance of surfaces. The critical issues  are the preparation and treatment of the film-substrate interface  for maximum adhesion, the formation of dense, mechanically robust  films, and the measurement and control of film properties. The  workshop will bring together leading researchers in the  significant areas of broad based PVD studies. The U.S.  participants to the workshop will bring expertise in the  measurement and control of film mechanical properties; the  Australian side has considerable expertise in PVD technology in  sputtering and cathodic arc evaporation. It is anticipated that  workshop manuscripts will be published in connection with the  scientific journal Surface Coatings and Technology.",
