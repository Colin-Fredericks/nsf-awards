 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enables faculty to design laboratories in an  introductory environmental science class that raise the  scientific literacy of students with little or no scientific  background through applying the pedagogy of learning.   New  equipment supports the creation of four laboratory exercises.    These exercises are designed so that students apply the  scientific method using recently developed data collection  technology and computer software.   The laboratory exercise  sequence starts students at a relatively low conceptual level at  which learning occurs through manipulating physical objects to  observe cause and effect relationships.   It concludes with a  sampling exercise that involves students with a more  intellectually sophisticated level of conceptual and analytical  thought.   The emphasis placed on intellectual development in  this series of laboratory exercises is unique and highly useful  in developing scientific literacy.    The new equipment  introduces scientifically illiterate students to (1) cause and  effect relationships in science through the use of a ground water  model and computer simulations that allow students to manipulate  variables and watch the results, (2) methods of collecting and  analyzing data that range from qualitative observations to the  use of state-of-the-art environmental sensors and computers, and  (3) effective communication of their discoveries and excitement  in a written and mathematical form.",
