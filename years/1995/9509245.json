The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Jesse C. Dann to work with Professor Maarten de  Wit at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.  The  U.S.-South Africa Program is providing a portion of the  support for this project.    This research project will involve the continuation of a  detailed mapping project of some of the oldest (3.5 billion  years old) and best preserved rocks on Earth, which are  located in the Barberton Greenstone Belt of South Africa.  The results will increase our understanding of the nature of  Archean crustal behavior, providing an important link in  reconstructing the tectonic history of the Earth.  The first  year of this project, funded by the South African Foundation  for Research and Development (FRD), allowed the initial  mapping and collection of samples for petrographic and  geochemical analysis.  During this second year, mapping will  be completed, analysis conducted and results worked into  publishable form. ***",
