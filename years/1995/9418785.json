Naturally occurring cell death is an integral part of normal development  and homeostasis.  In the nematode C elegans, a genetic pathway of programmed cell death has been identified.   Genetic mosaic analysis showed the ced-3 is most likely acting within dying cells to cause cell death.  ICE is a  vertebrate homolog of ced-3.  Overexpression of ICE in mammalian fibroblasts causes cells to undergo programmed  cell death.  A family of vertebrate homologs of the C.elegans ced-3 gene has been identified by this laboratory.  Ice-  3 is one of the most interesting homologs because it appears to encode both an activator and an inhibitor of cell  death.  The mRNA of Ice-3 is alternatively spliced into two different forms: Ice-3L, and Ice-3S.  When expressed  in Rat-1 cells, Ice-3L causes cells to die, while Ice-3S has the ability to prevent Rat-1 cell death induced by serum  deprivation.  A model is proposed in which ICE and ICE-3 act in parallel to control cell death.  This model will  be tested in a variety of experiments.  Biochemical and enzymatic properties of the ICE-3 protein will be studied  to reveal how ICE-3 acts to induce cell death.  The developmental pattern of Ice-3 expression will be examined.   Attempts will be made to isolate the activator, inhibitor and substrate of ICE-3 to identify upstream and downstream  elements of Ice-3.  Antibodies against ICE-3 will be generated and used to determine when and where the ICE-3  protein is made.  ICE-3 protein made by E. coli or baculovirus will be used to study the enzymatic properties of  ICE-3, with particular attention paid to the different potential roles of Ice-3L vs. Ice-3S. The yeast two hybrid  system will also be  used to isolate the genes that may encode proteins interacting with the ICE-3 protein.  Through  these studies, it is hoped to gain an understanding of the mechanism and function of Ice-3 in controlling programmed  cell death.  ***",
