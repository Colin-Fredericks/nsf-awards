 "awd_abstract_narration": "An apparatus has been designed that allows light microscopic  observation of living cell phenomena immediately followed by fast  immobilization of these phenomena with the aid of rapid freezing. Then  the ultrastructure of this cell cryo-whole-mount can be observed in an  electron microscope using a cryo-stage. This apparatus consists of  phase contrast, epifluorescence, and polarized light optical systems  assembled onto an optical bench. These optical systems are integrated  into one unit with a specimen carrier assembled onto a sliding  mechanism delivering the specimen into melting ethane. The unique  feature of this apparatus is that it allows us to accomplish the  fundamental goal of ultrastructural studies in life sciences, i.e.  direct correlation between images of a living cell with images of this  cell's ultrastructure, thus direct interpretation of molecular  mechanisms in a living cell.                   Using an apparatus prototype, we were able to capture early events  involved in adhesion of metastasizing cancer cells. Furthermore, we  have been able to discover a very delicate intranuclear cable network  that probably serves as a part of the cell distribution or signalling  system.         The goal of this project is to build a permanent instrument, to refine  its operation, and to prepare its expansion toward new imaging  capabilities by making six improvements: (1) addition of an intensified  charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera to allow observations on living  cells labelled with specific probes at low luminance; (2) addition of a  filter-wheel containing fluorochrome excitation and infrared filters,  as well as a multi-band barrier filter to ensure the correct register  of images during recording of images of cells labelled with multiple  probes; (3) addition of a dedicated computer to control shutters and  sliders and to link the apparatus to EtherNet communication; (4)  addition of Nomarski optics and motorized specimen stage to provide us  with the capability of optical s ectioning; (5) preparation for the  attachment of a real-time confocal laser-scanning imaging system and  optical tweezers; (6)preparation for the attachment of an atomic force  microscope (AFM).               Development of the proposed instrument is now essential to ensure  progress in four research projects; (a) structure and function of the  nuclear pore complex; (b) myofibril assembly in mammalian skeletal  muscle and the role played by expression of titin gene for this  assembly, (c) actomyosin based motility of keratocytes; (d) reduction  in Rhabdomyosarcoma malignancy by forced expression of myoD, myogenin  and titin genes.",
