The focus of the educational plan involves the development   of a novel graduate course in drug design and mechanism as well as   involving undergraduates in an active laboratory experience.   With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the   research and educational plan of Dr. Leslie Jimenez of the Department of   Chemistry at Rutgers University.  Professor Jimenez will focus her   research efforts on the development of short efficient syntheses of the   natural products mitomycin C and FR900482.  The focus of Dr. Jimenez'   educational plan involves the development of a novel graduate course in   drug design and mechanism as well as involving undergraduates in an   active laboratory  experience.",
