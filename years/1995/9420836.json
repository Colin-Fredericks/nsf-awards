 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of phototransduction captures the energy of  light by cells in the retina of the eye, converting it into  a nerve signal to the brain.  A useful model system for  studying this aspect of vision is the fruitfly Drosophila,  because its genetics are extremely well known and many  mutant strains are available.  One of the mutations in a  gene called \"norpA\" abolishes a step in phototransduction,  making the animal blind.  This gene normally produces an  enzyme called PLC (for phospholipase-C), which is an  important effector enzyme for one of the largest classes of  biochemical pathways for cellular signaling.  There are at  least two subtypes of PLC encoded by norpA.  One occurs only  in the eye, but the norpA gene also is expressed in other  tissues in the body unrelated to phototransduction,  suggesting its use in other cellular signaling pathways.  This work uses biochemical and molecular biological  techniques to examine how the norpA-encoded PLC functions in  the normal phototransduction pathway, during states of  adaptation to light and to dark.  The two protein subtypes  are tested to see whether the non-retinal subtype can  function adequately in vision if the retinal subtype is  absent.  Genetic deletion studies produce altered genes to  identify which domains of the PLC encoded by the norpA gene  are important for the visual function, and tissue-specific  expression of the norpA gene is examined to see where else  in the body the PLC is activated in non-visual signaling  pathways.  The work is an important step not only for  understanding the molecular basis of vision, but also for a  variety of fundamental signals involved in cell growth,  differentiation, and cellular secretion in both animals and  plants.",
