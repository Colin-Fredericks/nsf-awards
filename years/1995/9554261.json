 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maly  95-54261    Building on its expertise in networking, computer supported collaborative work, and remote learning, Old Dominion University will prepare to build a statewide highly Interactive Remote Instruction (IRI) pilot system based on networked workstations. Technology and pedagogical methods developed in the system will be integrated into TELETECHNET, a state funded program in which Old Dominion University and community colleges provides four-year degree programs. The first two years are being taught at the community colleges with the last two being provided by Old Dominion University to remote community college campuses via networked and televised course instructions. The project will consist of a three-year phase of research, development, implementation and evaluation.    Significant contributions include: 1) refining an existing IRI system to provide an open-ended teaching/learning environment with a set of basic features easy to use by students and faculty of all disciplines; 2) developing the basic concepts of new instructional methods to exploit the interactivity of the system in support of higher domains of learning; and 3) bringing together a consortium of government, industry and academic individuals who are dedicated to innovative approaches to education for the 21st century, and 4) providing Virginia with a cost-effective method of delivering high quality education remotely; and 5) serve as a model for other states faced with similar problems.    The proposed open hardware/software architecture uses existing technologies but anticipates the wider availability of a high-speed Information Superhighway and multimedia workstations in the near future. The system provides two-way video to remote sites; shared operation of X-window tools and applications; interactive note-taking; a VCR-like replay of past classes and ancillary material and a full motion video window which can display the instructor, a classroom demonstration, or any PC, Macintosh or X-window application.    These in structional capabilities enables instructors and students to access multimedia generated from a variety of sources and to use group collaboration tools for interaction between two participants, among small groups, or entire classes. The system will provide audio-visual interaction and allow faculty and remote-site students to share the manipulation of software tools, such as spreadsheets or chemistry models. While the elements of IRI are currently technically feasible, a major portion of the project's efforts are directed to the developing of new student-centered teaching methods and paradigms which take advantage of the environment and to refining the hardware and software through experience of actual instructional needs.  This system will provide easier access to higher education for both traditional and non-traditional students, who for personal or financial reasons choose not to reside at a four-year institution. IRI will promote effective use of network and computer technology for all participating students and faculty.",
