 "awd_abstract_narration": "While recent years have seen remarkable progress in   programming, both theoretically and practically, most of that    progress has come  in the solution of pure 0/1 problems.  On  the other hand,   mixed problems,  problems with both continuous  and discrete variables--  usually 0/1  variables--dominate in  practice;  moreover, practitioners   regularly produce  instances of these models that cannot be solved using   currently  available  codes.    This combination of success in solving pure 0/1   problems and the  existing demand for methods to solve difficult real-world   mixed  problems has  received considerable attention in the research  community.    Nevertheless,  general-purpose mixed-integer solvers  remain primarily   solvers, and while they often  employ rather sophisticated   ``heuristic'' devices,  they still use  few of the algorithmic ideas implicit in   recent theoretical  developments.  This research will attempt to change that    situation by  developing a research code including both the  standard   methods that have been  successful in practice, as well  as incorporating ideas based   upon recent  theoretical  developments.  The focus will be on actually   solving real-world  instances that arise as general mixed integer programs but   cannot  currently be  solved.",
