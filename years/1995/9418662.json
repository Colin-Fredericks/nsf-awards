 "awd_abstract_narration": "94118662  Brodsky      This award will support travel expenses and communication costs,  over a three year period, to enable Dr. Barbara Brodsky from the  Department of Biochemistry at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical  School in Piscataway, New Jersey, to conduct cooperative   research with Dr. John A. M. Ramshaw of the CSIRO Department  of Biomolecular Engineering in Parkville, Victoria, Australia.  The work will focus on defining the role specific amino acids  found in collagen have in the biological function of the protein.  The collagen triple-helix is the main protein in all connective  tissues, and collagen containing materials are becoming important  as biomaterials, as well as in the more traditional leather and  gelatin industries.  The principal investigators are  collaborating on a model peptide approach to determine the effect  of specific sequences on triple-helix stability and dynamics, to  identify the structural features of functional regions in  collagen, and to design collagen-like peptides which can form  ordered arrays.  The interests, expertise and facilities   available through this collaboration are complementary to the  proposed project.  The visit by Dr. Ramshaw to the laboratory in  New Jersey is funded by the Australian Department of Industry,  Science and Technology (DIST) under the U.S.-Australia  Cooperative Science Program.",
