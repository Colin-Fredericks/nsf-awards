 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424348  Balas   This objective of this research is to extend some earlier work undertaken by the investigators in integer and combinatorial optimization problems.  The research on which the current work is built was supported also by the National Science Foundation.  In earlier research, the investigators developed a new approach to solving mixed integer programming problems based on a framework described as 'lift-and-project cuts' within the context of the branch and bound technique.  The procedure has been founded to be robust and more efficient than any of the approaches currently used in solving mixed integer programs.  The current research is aimed at investigating some other unresolved questions associated with the improved technique.  Included in the questions to be resolved are matters related to the characterization of the computational behavior of the algorithm, development of some other new algorithms, and the design and implementation these algorithms to solve a broader class of problems.   The lift-and-project cut approach to mixed integer programming has applications to several areas of design, manufacturing, distribution, facility location, and civil infrastructure development.  One such application is the optimal design of multi-product batch plants in chemical engineering, where the optimization is concerned with the choice of unit plants sizes for various stages of the process and the batch sizes for the products.  Another example is the design of a cost-effective fiber optics network that protects services against the consequences of equipment failure.  In the area of civil infrastructure development, one example is the design of a minimum weight truss consisting of a number of specified bars with fixed modal locations, under specified conditions on stresses, bar elongations, and nodal displacement.  Another class of problems studied in this research is the generalized traveling salesman problem where the development technique can be used to construct optimal rolling cycles i n a hot strip mill.  This research has the potential to significantly enhance the advancement and the understanding of integer and combinatorial optimization problems.  Furthermore, several sectors of the economy stand to benefit from the results.",
