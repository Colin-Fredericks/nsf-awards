 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512427  Coveney      This grant, as part of the Academic Research Infrastructure(ARI)  program, provides $139,000 as partial support of the costs  acquiring an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-  MS) and peripheral supplies for the Department of Geosciences at  the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC).  This instrument  will support research and teaching within several academic  departments at  and will permit the acquisition of high-quality  spectrographic data for more than 60 chemical elements of  interest, including all major components of silicate rocks and  soils and minor and trace constituents of particular concern to  the geological and environmental sciences as well as to the  material and chemical sciences. The ICP-MS will be the only  spectrographic equipment available on the UMKC campus and will be  used in numerous investigations including:  (1) the distributions  of metals in black shales in the Midwest, (2) groundwater  contamination from naturally metal-rich shales in the Midwest,  (3) the geology of hazardous waste sites, (4) deterioration of  building stones by environmental agents, (5) paleoclimates  related to Quaternary basins and pluvial lakes in the Pacific  Northwest, (6) the genesis of iron sulfide minerals, (7) the  origins of uniquely bedded Ni-Mo deposits in Cambrian shales from  China, (8) lead-zinc mineralization in country rocks of the  Midwest, (9) impurities held by large organic molecules being  imaged by atomic force microscopy and (10) compositions of bones  and teeth.  Eight faculty, drawn from five academic departments,  have needs for this equipment for research and teaching.  The  establishment of this ICP-MS laboratory at UMKC will facilitate  research by faculty while, at the same time, permitting UMKC  students to become proficient in a modern spectrometric  technique. The lab will be an essential resource for the training  of M.S. students enrolled in the Urban Environmental Geology  program at UMKC, as well as for students from  the UMKC's  innovative interdisciplinary Ph.D. program, for graduate students  from the other sciences at UMKC, and for undergraduates from the  physical and environmental sciences.      ***",
