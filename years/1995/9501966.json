 "awd_abstract_narration": "Damon    Under the direction of Drs. Frederick Damon and Stephen Plog, Mr.  Simon Bickler will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He  will conduct an archaeological survey and excavation on Woodland  Island in the Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea. A  systematic survey will be carried out to develop a model of  prehistoric settlement on Woodlark, focusing initially along the  coastlines of a central strip of the island. Particular areas of  interest, including a prehistoric stone axe quarry and  archaeological features such as stone megaliths and trenches will  be examined in particular detail. Surface collections of pottery  and other artifacts will provide a rough chronological sequence  for the settlement of the island. In addition, clay and stone  sources will be sampled to provide the basis for a petrographic  and chemical characterization program to model larger interisland  trade.    Melanesia, which includes Woodland Island is well known to  anthropologists because of the \"Kula\" exchange system which  developed there. People who speak different languages and live on  widely separated islands engage in a complex ritual exchange  system in which items of symbolic value are traded among specific  interlocking sets of groups in very tightly defined ways. Because  of its unique nature and the role it serves to bind widely  separated groups into a common social network, it has been the  object of intense anthropological study. However it is not known  when or how this system developed and it has not been possible to  study how this system developed. The goal of Mr. Bickler's work  is to provide such information.    This work is important for several reasons. It will provide data  of interest to many archaeologists and social anthropologists. It  will shed light on social organization of people who live in  traditional societies and will assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.  ***",
