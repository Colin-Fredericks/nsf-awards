 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553315  Miller    The Mid-South Alliance For Minority Participation (MAMP) consists  of a coalition of nine Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) all  within commuting distance in the tri-state area of three two-year   colleges, and three majority colleges.  The alliance contains the  largest Tennessee community college, the largest Tennessee two-year  technical institution, the largest tennessee Board of Regents (TBR)  undergraduate institution, a private college with 47% majoring in  engineering and science, the University of Tennessee In Memphis a  predominantly graduate institution, three HBCUs, and the fastest  growing community college in eastern Arkansas.  It is an alliance  of private colleges, minority colleges, community colleges,  majority colleges,with African American community agencies and the  secondary school system.  One most probably should conclude the  demographics of Tennessee (See Figure 1 on next page).  Tennessee  is a very long (480 miles) narrow state with the three largest  cities 2000 miles apart with Memphis being the largest.   Financially disadvantaged African American students cannot afford  to travel several hundred miles to participate.  the western  section of tennessee is the Memphis section bordering West Memphis  has the highest density of African American students in the  Tennessee, and the neighboring counties in the tri-state area have  a high concentration of African Americans.  This Memphis Mid-South  region has a minority population of 499,599, which is twice as  large as the combination of the Nashville and the knoxville regions  (13 counties each).  Shelby county containing Memphis contains  371,267 year.  54% off all the youth in the city of Memphis are  African Americans.  47% of the youth in the Mid-South region are  African Americans while the Nashville and Knoxville regions are  only 18.4% density of the African American population and youth  decreases rapidly as one travel west to east as many African  American youth as Nashville and 13.5 ti mes as many as the knoxville  area.  During the first year, 320 incoming minority freshmen and  sophomore students will be prepared for completing baccalaureate  degrees in SEM and eventually graduate degrees.  The program  consists of instruction, and personal development during the summer  and mentoring and cooperative learning during the academic year  followed by research and employment in science laboratories.   14,700 African American  undergraduate students are already  enrolled in these Mid-South Alliance colleges.  The Mid-South  Alliance intends to create a cadre of 800 minority students in the  SEM baccalaureate programs each year.  After the fifth year 160  more will be in the first year of graduate schools for a total of  960 per year.  An additional 1000 African American students  majoring in SEM baccalaureate programs each year.  An additional  1000 African American students majoring in SEM studies will be  influenced through auxiliary activities on the various campuses  through seminary by visiting African American role models.  The  fact that we have nine active IHE's in the alliance within  commuting distance allows us to work with small groups of twenty  students and yet permit all the first year students to come  together on minority and majority campuses for multicultural  activities during our summer and academic year activities.  This  Alliance will provide a stimulating means for students to work  their way through school with internships in science laboratories.   African American role models working as mentors will meet in  regularly scheduled classes for cooperative learning.  Memphis  Partners, one of the Alliances member, received a $3 million grant  form the Dept. of Labor in July, 1994 in \"young Fair Chance\" to  encourage African American into new careers, and provide African  American mentors and science related internships.  The Memphis  school system received a $300,00 planning grant from the NSF, and  opened an office of School Redesign and Training now funded  by a  private foundation.  Their CEO is on the Advisory Committee of MAMP  to improve bridging mechanisms from secondary to postsecondary  institutions.  Graduate schools and national laboratories will  provide research experiences to Alliance students for the  sophomores and juniors.  The MAMP views laboratory research by the  participants as extremely important to inspire students to continue  for graduate SEM degrees.  The pool of minority students will be  increased through recruitment to SEM college degree programs from  other disciplines, two-year colleges, and secondary schools.   Mentors will assist and encourage all Alliance scholars to apply to  SEM graduate schools.",
