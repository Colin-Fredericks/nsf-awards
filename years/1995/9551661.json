 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university is creating two Mathematica Laboratories:  a  Calculus Laboratory to support its continued involvement in  testing materials for the Duke University/Bowdoin College Project  CALC program and an Applied Mathematics Laboratory to expand the  use of laboratory materials to mathematics majors.  The goals of  the project are as follows:  (1) Construction of an optimum  hardware/software teaching environment for a Mathematica Calculus  Lab where materials can be tested and modified and where  supplemental teaching materials can be developed.  (2)  Construction of an optimum independent study, Mathematica Applied  Mathematics Lab for use by mathematics majors, in which new  materials can be tested.  This lab is also used by science and  mathematics students already trained in the use of Mathematica.   (3) Dissemination of information, regarding issues of teaching  and learning mathematics in a laboratory environment, to  colleagues at the collegiate and pre-collegiate level.  (4)  Strengthening partnerships with two area high schools (one that  enrolls 90 percent minority students and one all-women  institution) to encourage the development and implementation of  mathematics reform curricula at the pre-collegiate level.   Evaluation will occur by continuing Student Attitude Surveys and  by the university participating in the Duke University evaluation  process:  \"A Comparison of Reformed and Traditional Calculus.\"   Dissemination plans, beyond those associated with the  university's role as a test-site for Project CALC, include summer  workshops, presentations, and publications.",
