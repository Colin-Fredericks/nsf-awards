 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh in the purchase of a cluster of SGI  Indigo workstations.  This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the  following:  (a) simulation of the properties of clusters and colloidal suspensions, (b) the  investigation of the dynamics of excited molecules in condensed phases, (c) the modeling of  electron transfer reactions in donor-bridge-acceptor compounds and proteins, (d) the use  of electronic structure calculations to characterize electronically excited states, and (e) to  study reactions of hydrogen on silicon surfaces, and the design of optical waveguides.  On  the instructional side, the proposed workstations will be used in several undergraduate and  graduate courses to introduce our students to modern methods in molecular modeling and  theoretical chemistry.    A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the   computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a \"computer network\" also serves as a   development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art  graphics and visualization facilities and supports research in state-or-the-art applications  of  parallel prmcessing.",
