 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424373  Lewis      This award will support the participation of ten American and  fifteen foreign scientists and engineers at a symposium on the  involvement of women and young scientists and engineers to be  held in Beijing, China in June 1995 in conjunction with the  XVIII Pacific Science Congress, which is held every four years.  Dr. Nancy Davis Lewis, the Associate Dean of the College of  Social Sciences at the University of Hawaii, is the American   co-organizer.  The Co-Convener is Dong Guilan, Director for  Science and Technology Policy at the National Research Center  for Sciences and Technology Development in Beijing. The   Secretary General for the XVIII Pacific Science Congress is  Congbin Fu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The organizers  are also working in cooperation with Wu Ganmei, Secretary General  of the China Women's Association for Science and Technology.    The Pacific Science Congress will have as its theme \"Population,  Resources and Environment: Prospects and Initiatives\".  This  symposium will focus on establishing a dialogue and initiating  programs that encourage the participation of women and young  investigators in science in Asia and the Pacific.  Sessions   to be held during the meeting will be devoted to taking stock  on available human resources, science and the role of culture,  and women and the nature of the scientific enterprise.  Shorter  discussion periods will be devoted to initiatives that are  showing a positive influence on encouraging scientific careers,  the role of national and international organizations, and   regional cooperation.    Funds from this grant also will be used to support participants  from the southeast Asian region with particular attention  to the participation of individuals from the Pacific Islands  who are often overlooked in regional activities.  Dr. Lewis  has extensive contacts in the region and its educational and  scientific organizations and is well placed to assure Pacific  Island participation. This is particularl y timely because the  next Inter-Congress meeting of the Pacific Science Association,  \"The Islands in the Pacific Century\", will be held in Suva, Fiji  in mid-1997.  The discussions on women and young people in Asia  and Pacific Science initiated at the Beijing meeting can  continue, with even wider Pacific Island participation, in Suva   in 1997.",
