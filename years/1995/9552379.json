Wadhams                                    DUE 9552379  Golden West College                                FY1995 $ 35,204  Huntington Beach, CA  92647                        ILI - Instrumentation                                                      Project:                                                      Mathematics    Title: The Golden West College Multimedia Classroom-Laboratory             This project converts two traditional classrooms into  Multimedia Classroom-Laboratories each equipped with two large  screen monitors and a computer capable of running Macintosh and DOS  software.  This project also expands the Mathematics Department's  existing Mathematica Computer-Lab from 16 to 25 stations in order  to accommodate the anticipated increased usage.  In addition to the  initial target group of Precalculus and Calculus students, the use  of the lab will be expanded to include Linear Algebra, Discrete  Math, Statistics, and Math for Elementary Teachers.  The use of  cooperative learning activities and projects are the catalyst to  transform students from observers to active learners capable of  using technology to solve mathematical problems and implement  mathematical models.  Transforming the traditional classroom into  the Multimedia Classroom-Laboratory addresses the need to use  appropriate technology, projects, and increased student involvement  on a daily basis to:                  modify the role of the student from observer to active                learner;                increase the effectiveness of learning activities by                reducing student frustration in interfacing with the                computers;                enhance communication with both native and non-native                English speakers;                improve student problem solving and modeling skills;                modify the instructor's role from lecturer to coach.           Evaluation and dissemination include the formation of an  advisory board for evaluation and a video tape for  dissemination.  An advisory board consisting of faculty in mathematics and other  disciplines; representatives of High School, four year schools,  selected local industries, and students will provide feedback on  the appropriateness and effectiveness of the changes in the  curriculum.  The video tape is to demonstrate the Multimedia  Classroom-Laboratory in action and is intended to communicate  results to the teaching community.",
