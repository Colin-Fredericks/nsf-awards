 "awd_abstract_narration": "Skidmore College, located in Saratoga Springs, NY, is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation and replacement of research and research training space in the Dana Science Center.  Erected in 1968, the Dana Science Center is home to the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Geology.  Since the construction of the facility, enrollment has increased by fifty percent, and majors in both geology and physics have been established to complement the majors in biology and chemistry.  This tremendous growth has been accompanied by a succession of minor ad hoc remodeling to the Science Center to provide necessary, but inefficient research space.  This renovation project will allow the departments to reconfigure their research areas to provide for improved safety, flexibility, and efficiency in meeting the research needs and desires of students and faculty, thereby significantly enhancing both collaborative and student research efforts.   The renovation of the Science Center is one part of a two-phase effort by Skidmore to improve its science facilities.  In addition to the modernization of existing laboratory space, the College is committed to  providing more dedicated  research and teaching space by constructing an annex to the building.  Renovations will include: rearrangement of bench areas and replacement of insufficient storage facilities, installation of new fume hoods, separation of research space from instructional space, upgrade and replacement of HVAC and plumbing systems respectively.  Research activity in the departments served by Dana will be enhanced by the reorganization and modernization of laboratory space that will serve an increase number of student researchers.  Improved synergy will result from the removal of walls that serve as barriers to effective communication.  Future growth in research activities will be accommodated without compromising safety or reducing access to facilities.",
