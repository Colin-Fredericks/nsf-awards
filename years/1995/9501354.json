 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports research and instruction in the  empirical evaluation of software inspection methods.  Software  inspection is a  widely used, but very expensive validation  process.  Initial research has  demonstrated that many of the  assumptions underlying this process are incorrect  and, therefore,  this research involves the following three families of  experiments.  (1) Comparing defect detection techniques.  This  experiment compares the cost-effectiveness of systematic  inspection techniques with that of  the standard Ad Hoc and  Checklist approaches.  Its hypothesis is that  systematic  inspection techniques are more effective that the nonsystematic  ones currently being used.   (2) Cost-benefit studies.  This  experiment is  conducted on a live development project to  compare the tradeoffs between  minimum inspection interval and  maximum effectiveness for several different  inspection  approaches.  Its hypothesis is that several recently proposed  methods significantly increase interval, but provide only a  slight improvement  in effectiveness.  (3) Inspection entry  criteria.  This experiment attempts  to establish whether or  not an artifact's quality affects inspection  effectiveness.  Its  hypothesis is that traditional inspections are not  effective for  artifacts with very high or very low defect density.    This  research is also producing materials that enhance both  graduate and  undergraduate teaching.  This includes a  4-week teaching module in which  students perform experiments, collect and  analyze data, and test  hypotheses as part of a graduate software engineering  course.  An  undergraduate software development course is being developed in which all students  work together  to develop one large-scale application, for real  customers with real needs.",
