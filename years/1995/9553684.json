 "awd_abstract_narration": "To provide employees skilled in metrology and ISO 9001 to the  engineering, manufacturing, and service/installation industries.   To achieve this goal, a collaboration will be established between  the Machine Tool Program at Madison Area Technical College, the  suppliers and users of precision measuring, the University of WI  Center for Quality and Productivity Improvement, the Madison  Metropolitan School District, and the WI School-To-Work  Initiatives; and also articulation of participation from other  secondary and postsecondary educational institutions and  professional organizations.  This proposal is to be a  well-coordinated, highly integrated effort to:  1) Develop and  disseminate curriculum materials specifically designed for  technical training at the two-year associate degree level; 2)  Provide teacher enhancement activities in advanced dimensional  metrology and ISO 9001 that include summer institutes, mentoring  and curriculum development partnerships for associate degree and  secondary level school teachers; and 3) Support the development and  coordination of industry-led statewide programs to offer work-based  experiences for high school students; and 4) Assemble a mobile  metrology laboratory to provide student education, teacher  enhancement, and calibration of precision measuring tools.  The  proposed program will link together the development of  instructional materials with faculty enhancement, student  laboratory experience and school-to-work initiatives.",
