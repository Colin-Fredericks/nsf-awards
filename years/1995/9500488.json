 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for Professor Gerald Eagleson of Loras College to spend several months collaborating in developmental neurobiology research with Bruce Jenks and others of the Institute of Neuroscience of the University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands and with Dr. A. J. Dunston of the University of Utrecht.  Their joint research will focus on the factors which influence the early development of the area of the amphibian brain which ultimately becomes the hypothalamo-pars intermedia complex.  The participating research groups in the Netherlands have substantial experience and extensive facilities for investigating the morphological and physiological aspects of this complex in the adult amphibian, Xenopus.  Dr. Eagleson has done landmark work on the embryological development of the amphibian brain and pituitary gland, ranging from microdissection and mapping to experimental studies of gene expression and inductive agents between various tissues.  This proposed collaboration brings together a unique blend of complementary expertise from the U.S. and Europe to study the origin of the functional relationship between the brain and the pituitary.  The results of the research to be carried out by Dr. Eagleson and his colleagues will be a fundamental contribution to our understanding of the development of this neuroendocrine feedback system.",
