 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500874  Rosenthal      The proposers intend to work on several fundamental problems in   the structure theory of infinite dimensional Banach spaces.   Specifically, Odell will study whether there are Banach spaces   of bounded distortion, or of arbitrary distortion but not biorthogonal   distortion. These questions are strongly motivated by Odell's recent joint   discovery with Schlumprecht, that Hilbert space is distortable in the strongest   sense. He also intends to study whether certain almost isometric asymptotic   assumptions  on a Banach space insure that it contains one of the classical   spaces   lp   for    1  < or =  p  <  infinity  or c subscript 0. Odell will   also investigate whether the Huff criterion characterizes spaces isomorphic   to those with the uniform Kadec-Klee property, and whether the Point of   Continuity Property is basically determined. Rosenthal will study further   possible characterizations of spaces containing c subscript 0, related to   his recent characterization that a non-reflexive space contains   c subscript 0   provided all its subspaces have weakly sequentially complete duals. For   example, he will study the question of whether an script L infinity saturated   space contains   c subscript 0, and whether a Banach subspace   X   of   C(K)   contains   c subscript 0  provided the complement of X in X** contains   functions whose   alpha-th  oscillation is bounded, for all countable ordinals   alpha. Rosenthal also wises to investigate Banach spaces with separable duals,   for example the problem of whether such spaces are isomorphic to subspaces of   quotients of  C(alpha)  (for   alpha  a countable ordinal), with particular   attention given to the Hilbert space case. Rosenthal will also study the   long-standing open problem of whether  complemented subspaces of  C(K)  spaces   are again isomorphic to a  C(K)-space.       The study of structural properties of infinite-dimensional Banach spaces   is one of the most profound, fundamental research areas i n modern analysis.   These spaces underlie  the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics,   and understanding and penetrating their structure is basic for modern research   in functional analysis and its applications to physics.  Recently there have   been spectacular advances in this area.  Deep long standing open problems have   been solved, and both proposers have been heavily involved in these advances.    Of course there are many more fundamental open problems remaining and the   proposers intend to tackle some of these basic questions.   ***",
