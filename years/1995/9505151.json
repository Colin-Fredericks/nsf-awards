Underlying the approach are  a) the idea of oracles, which know perfectly well how to adapt representations   ideally,  b) the idea that the goal of adaptation in the presence of noisy data is to   quantify how closely realizable procedures (which do not have privileged   information about the object) can mimic an oracle,  and c) the design of   procedures coming as close as possible to the oracle.  The project  also develops  methods for comparing different adaptation schemes by comparing  oracles of different kinds, for example time-frequency oracles  and time-scale oracles.  This is an outgrowth of our earlier   results on wavelets, where this approach was used to show that wavelets  have a property of being nearly-ideally spatially adaptive.  In addition a  computational environment is being developed for   implementing and systematically testing such approaches.     As a further outgrowth of the proposers' earlier work on wavelets,  the project studies a number of improvements and extensions  of wavelet shrinkage, for example in the directions of classification,  confidence bands, correlated data and selection of orthogonal bases.    This research seeks to develop statistical theory  and computational tools in the general area of adaptive methods of  representing and analyzing signals, images and other objects.  On the one hand, this project is prompted by the extremely  high interest in adaptation on the part of people working  in fields of signal processing, image processing,   time-frequency analysis, speech processing analysis.  New signal representations appear in these fields almost daily,  along with new principles fo r selecting representations.  Such representations are useful for data compression, which is not  the main interest here; but they are also useful for noise removal and   signal interpretation, which are important areas for statisticians to consider.  On the other hand, this project is prompted by the goal  of developing statistical theory which can give clear understanding  of such adaptive schemes. Some of the most highly adaptive schemes  being suggested in signal processing pose a real challenge  to traditional statistical thinking.  For example, some adaptation schemes   search (either explicitly or implicitly) through thousands or millions of  representations of a signal in order to arrive at their final result.  A statistician,  when thinking about applying such methods to a noisy signal, is by training   forced to ask to what extent the result merely reflects the  effects of snooping through noise, detecting pseudo-structure which actually  due to noise, and due to the vigorous search.  The research seeks to develop  fundamental tools in theoretical statistics to aid understanding of  such adaptive procedures, and shows how to tune them so they are  noise-cognizant and stable.  This project may have two spin-offs.  First,  some of the results may be stimulating and/or useful to  the community of ``inventors of adaptive procedures'' in  signal, image, speech, and time/frequency, and related communities.  Second, the theoretical work may stimulate statisticians to take  more interest in making further contributions in such directions.",
