 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522253 Carter  The goals of this research project are to gain new understanding of microscopic details, particularly chemical bonding and defects, at heterostructure interfaces and of dislocations in the lattice of compound semiconductors.  The research will emphasize studies of anti-site bonding which is thought to be an intrinsic factor in the core of dislocations and of nearly all grain boundaries in these materials.  Correlation between observed and calculated defect structures will be made through computer image simulation.  The electrical properties of interfaces will be investigated by high-resolution cathodoluminescence and electron-beam induced current techniques.  Additionally, the mechanical behavior of individual interfaces will be studied by controlled deformation experiments.  The project will utilize samples specially prepared where interfaces and defects have been introduced in a controlled manner so that improved understanding of the defects can be obtained, and also understanding of the ways new information can be used to both exploit defect behavior or to develop strategies to control, avoid or eliminate the defects. %%% This research project will apply state-of-the-art materials science analysis and computer simulation techniques to obtain basic understanding of defects at critical interfaces in advanced structures of compound semiconductor materials used in lasers and electronic devices.  This research will contribute to improve fundamental understanding of interface chemistry and physical properties as well as other defects which limit the applications or lifetime of semiconductor devices.  An important feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
