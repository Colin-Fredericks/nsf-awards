 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal:  DMS 9504470  PI:  Stein  Institution:  University of Chicago  Title:  Statistical Inference for Large Spatial and Space-Time Datasets    Abstract:     This research considers both applied and theoretical problems arising in  statistical analysis of spatial and space-time data.  The applied aspect  is the detailed modeling and analysis of stratospheric ozone levels as  measured via satellite at over 30,000 locations daily for over a decade.  The goal is to model the data at the high level of spatial and temporal  resolution it is taken and not to aggregate over space and/or time as  has been done in all previous statistical analyses of these data.  To reach this goal, it will be necessary to consider in detail the nature  of the measurement process and the space-time variations of ozone  concentrations due to such factors as long-term trends,  seasonal effects, variations both within and across latitudes   (which are quite different) and possibly the relationship of ozone  to meteorological conditions. The immense size of this dataset provides   a strong connection to the theoretical aspect of this proposal:  the study   of asymptotic problems in the analysis of spatial data.  In particular, a fixed domain asymptotic approach, in which the number of  observations in some fixed region of space increasing, is adopted.  Using this approach, this research studies the asymptotic properties of  spatial periodograms for estimating the high frequency behavior of the  spectral density of a stationary random field and the effect of misspecifying   spectral densities on prediction problems. The ultimate goal is to connect   these two problems and to understand the effect of estimating spectral densities   on subsequent predictions.      Satellite based instruments measure numerous aspects of the earth and  its atmosphere with high resolution in space and time.  For example, the Total Ozone Monitoring Spectrometer (TOMS) measures  ozone levels at over 30,000 locations daily, providing a much  grea ter level of detail than can possibly be attained using ground-based  instruments. However, this high spatial resolution has not been put to much   use, as statistical analyses to date of this dataset have been on ozone levels  averaged over large regions. Using 10 years of TOMS records as a test case,  this project develops statistical and computational methods for analyzing the   spatial-temporal structure of large, high-resolution geophysical datasets.  This research aims to provide a better understanding of the space-time dynamics  of stratospheric ozone and hence the opportunity to more accurately assess the   effect of anthropogenic emissions on ozone levels, a problem of worldwide  environmental concern. The methods developed in this research may prove   useful in analyzing other large satellite based space-time datasets, such as   meteorological conditions relevant to global climate change.  In addition, this research studies theoretical properties of statistical methods   when applied to large spatial and space-time datasets.",
