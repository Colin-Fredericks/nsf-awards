The research  this  investigator plans to conduct is directed toward improving  our  fundamental understanding of the biodegradation patterns of  benzene, toluene and xylene compounds in an anoxic/aerobic  sequencing batch, suspended biomass reaction process for  treatment of wastewater containing these pollutants.  The  investigator's education plan involves incorporating the  research  procedures into courses to illustrate the beneficial  attributes  of combining physical and biological approaches to the  engineering design of systems to accomplish useful  environmental  goals and objectives.    Results of this investigator's research are likely to  improve the  approaches taken toward engineering design of sequencing  batch  reaction processes for removal of benzene, toluene xylene  compounds from wastewater.  The teaching plan she plans to  pursue  is likely to produce innovations in the way that  environmental  engineering undergraduate courses are taught.  ***",
