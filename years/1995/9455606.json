Using Visual Basic,  multi-media software and object oriented programs are being  developed by supervising instructors.  Students are utilizing a  graphical user interface and icon driven software to access and  control various instructional media. The goal is to immerse the  student in an intensely interactive, but easily constructed,  simulated learning environment. This radically new system is  meeting each student's unique and specific needs and providing an  individualized tutorial session with appropriate, constructive,  instructive, and timely feedback. Artificial intelligence  techniques are being applied to implement the concept of guides  whose behavior and even personality is being made to depend upon  the attributes of the learner. The guide presents a combination of  interactive digitized video and audio integrated with graphics and  text to provide the students with choices of lecture, drill,  problem solving, review and testing as deemed beneficial or  necessary through monitoring of the student's progress and relative  success.  The software is being used to supplement and enhance, not  replace, coursework.",
