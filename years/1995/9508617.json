These   programs will strengthen the links between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of   doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both academia and industry.   In collaboration with polymer scientists at the Lord Corporation, the postdoctoral   fellow will use material independent force and moment balance derivations combined with   a material dependent finite strain elasticity theory to develop and validate nonlinear   dynamic models for rubber based filled elastomers undergoing large deformations. The   resulting nonlinear partial differential equation models, to be used in design of controllable   or \"smart material\" elastomers, will be modified and validated using specially designed   experiments performed in Lord Corporation labs along with inverse problem algorithms   that are developed. These algorithms and associated computational packages will be   developed in the context of a mathematical framework for wellposedness and   approximation  that will be developed by the applied mathematicians in this   multidisciplinary team.",
