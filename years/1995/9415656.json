These inter-related  subjects  involve   the  physics  of  liquid  crystals  at  three  levels,   the  microscopic  level of the molecules or particle and their interaction,  the   mesoscopic  level  of  ordered  phase  formation  and  materials  properties, and the macroscopic level of observable phenomenology. The  objective   is   to  develop  fundamental  understanding   of   liquid  crystalline  ordering  and  its  consequences  in  the  systems  being  studied.   The  general  knowledge  gained  from  these  studies   has  implications for the synthesis and processing of novel materials, such  as  ultra-high-strength  fibers, and  for  potential  biosynthesis  of  materials in which self-assembly is important.  %%%  Non-technical abstract: This project concerns several related subjects  in  the physics of liquid crystals: colloidal liquid crystals based on  aqueous  virus  suspensions, molecular aggregate liquid crystals,  and  dynamical systems and pattern formation.
