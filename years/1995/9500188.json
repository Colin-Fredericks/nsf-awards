 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500188  Wunsch II    The Department of Electrical Engineering at Texas Tech University will purchase computer simulation and visualization equipment which will be dedicated to support research in eingineering.  The equipment  will be used for several projects, including in particular neural network methods for control, system identification, prediction, image compression, and image analysis.  These projects have in common high computational requirements in  simulation, and difficulty in data  analysis requireing special visualizaiton tools.   The  equipment  selected is especially designed with these needs I mind.  Furthermore, the manufacturer has an agreement with one of the leading neural network small businesses.  This allows simulation of some of the most sophisticated and dirfficult neural network designs on their computer.  This company has agreed to additional cost sharing in the form of a free site licence for this project because they believe in it and are interested in seeing the results.  This additional cost sharing is above and beyond the required insititional commitment.",
