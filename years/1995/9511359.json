The development of brain structural and behavioral sexual  dimorphisms is a topic of intense investigation, as are attempts to  define the factors responsible for inducing the structural changes.   However, little information about the different functions of brain  dimorphic peptide modulatory systems have been forthcoming.   In  the present studies, Dr. John Axelson proposes to investigate how  steroid hormones modulate brain development during critical pre-  and post-natal periods.  These studies will determine if modulation  of the steroid hormone environment during early or late development  influences not only behavioral patterns and memory, but also the  amounts of information transmitting molecules in the brain.  Dr.  Axelson will be investigating the role of the  vasopressin-containing neurons in the brain and whether this  neuropeptide system is involved in sexually dimorphic development  of social recognition memories.  Further, it is proposed to examine  the role of steroid hormones in the generation of dimorphic  patterns of vasopressin expression as a basis for understanding  their role in behavioral changes.  The proposed studies will  generate novel information about brain development and the  corresponding behaviors that will enhance our understanding of  human behavior and cognition.",
