 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing algorithms to recognize objects in wide-  angle images using local symmetries.  A new mathematical model of  imaging geometry, based on stereographic projection, provides a  more accurate model of real wide-angle lenses than traditional  perspective projection.  It also creates a simple mathematical  relationship between local symmetries of round objects and their  outlines in 2D images: symmetries project onto symmetries.   Finally, projection of small objects is approximately orthographic,  so that existing algorithms for detecting skew symmetries  (symmetries of flat 3D objects) can be adapted to wide fields of  view. An object recognition system is being constructed, using both  skew and non-skew symmetries, a calibrated camera/lens system, and  a canonical frame construction.  Faster algorithms are being  developed to detect symmetries so they can be used to group edges   in complex wide-angle images.  This project is evaluating  techniques for using additional views of an object to verify or  disambiguate possible symmetries, such as imposing depth  constraints on the initial search for symmetries and confirming  that the apparent shape of the object changes appropriately between  two views.  The frequency of local symmetries in real objects, and  their stability across changes in viewpoint, is also being studied.",
