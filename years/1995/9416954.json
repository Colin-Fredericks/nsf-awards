In order to seek answers  to these problems, the PI proposes the following research thrusts:         a) the three-dimensional structure and maintenance mechanism       of summertime stationary eddies and their interannual       variation component; and         b) the basic structure and time evolution of the interdecadal       variation mode of the wintertime atmospheric circulation over       the past five decades (1946-1994), and the possible mechanism       inducing this interdecadal variation.    The mechanisms responsible for the interannual variation of  summertime stationary eddies and interdecadal variation of  wintertime circulation, as suggested from diagnostic analyses, will  be tested with the NCAR Community Climate Model, and the  corresponding linearized version.  Several data sources, including  the OLR, COADS, NMC and ECMWF GDAS (1979-1994), NMC octagonal-grid  (1946-1993) and 35-year reanalyzed NMC GDAS (1958-1993) data, will  be used in the proposed research thrusts.  Funds and time allowing,  some further work will be done on seasonal and interannual  variations of global relative atmospheric angular momentum, and the  roles played by these variations in low-frequency climate  variability.    This research is important because it seeks to enhance knowledge  about climate processes on seasonal-to-interdecadal time scales.",
