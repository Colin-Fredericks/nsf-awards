 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500870  Cowen      The investigator proposes to study the structure of bounded linear operators  on the Hardy and Bergman Hilbert spaces and related problems of matrix theory,   approaching problems on concretely presented operators and their applications in  order to gain insight into more general problems.  In particular, he will   continue his investigations of composition operators,   slant Toeplitz operators, and related problems from matrix analysis.   The project will also involve the direction of research of several   undergraduate students in matrix analysis and its applications to some   engineering problems with the goal of attracting young people to   graduate study and research in mathematics.      In this project, the investigator and his graduate students will work on   several fundamental questions about composition operators on Bergman and Hardy   spaces including investigation into the explanations for unexpected circular   symmetry in most composition operators and seeking ways to break operators into   simpler components when the symbol is a function of several variables with   special structure.  Further, the investigator and his graduate students will   investigate the spectral theory of slant Toeplitz operators, a class of   weighted composition operators with applications to smoothness criteria for   wavelets.  These projects will use tools from the theory of operators on   Hilbert space and the theory of analytic functions in one and several   variables and will build on the investigator's experience in the study of   Toeplitz operators and composition operators.  ***",
