 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eleven higher education institutions, including community  colleges, private liberal arts colleges, and public  institutions, will collaborate with local schools and  community agencies in the Portland metropolitan area.  The  overlapping goals of this partnership are three-fold:  1)  develop a coherent and coordinated plan to increase and  support minority students in mathematics and science  education, and work to secure commitments from member  institutions to implement the plan; 2) develop a plan for  establishing a Middle School Science Program modeled on the  successful Middle School Math Program at PSU; 3) develop a  plan for a coordinated program of mathematics and science  courses recommended for preservice mathematics and science  teachers, and include plans for revision and design of  courses to be added.  Anogher goal is to develop and  disseminate an inter-campus catalogue of course listing,  descriptions of relevant faculty, programs, placement  affiliations, departmental strengths, enrollments, and  student demographics.  Each goal will be met through task  forces dedicated to each of these individually, but with the  collective efforts of all task force members who will be  informed of developments through electronic bulletin board.  The three task forces will each be chaired by teams of two  members from the Steering Committee.  Each task force will  have eight task force leaders responsible for coordinating  their task force's activities.  Anb additional 22 members  will join each task force to develop plans for change in  their respective focus area.  All plans will be completed to  the extent that member institutions should be able to begin  implementation by the end of this grant period.",
