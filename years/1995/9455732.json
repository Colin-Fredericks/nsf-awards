Many approaches  have been developed to overcome these problems, and have met with  reasonable success in small institutions, or for a particular  professor. These approaches are often too expensive or complicated  to transfer to large comprehensive universities. Also, graduate  students, the future instructors of science, are in general  inadequately trained as educators. A teaching system designed to  overcome these problems in a method that could be standardized and  made available to larger engineering schools, as well as being  appropriate for smaller institutions, will be developed. The method  involves leading the student from concrete \"hands-on\" examples to  conceptual understanding through group discussion, in the idea  first, name afterward fashion. Quantitative experimental results  provide verification. Concepts are related to everyday phenomena  familiar to the student. Students are taught how to think about  physics problems. Cooperative learning, found to improve retention  of female and minority students, is emphasized. Graduate and  advanced undergraduate students are brought into the teaching  process as apprentices, with materials to acquaint them with the  teaching strategies to be employed. In a calculus-based  introductory physics course (>300 students annually), over a three  year period, the technique will be refined, using testing and  interviews to determine the most successful strategies. The results  will be made available in a format designed to facilitate  implementation elsewhere. A standard of evaluation for conceptual  understanding for electromagnetism, similar to the Hestenes  mechanics evaluati on, will be developed. The \"hands-on\" Activity  Guide would be useful in non-engineering courses, particularly  classes for educators, and could be adapted for use in lower  education.",
