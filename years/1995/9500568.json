 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500568  Grove    This project seeks to develop a fundamental approach to the study  of mixing   layers, nonlinear materials, and fluid chaos. Nonlinear waves in  hyperbolic   conservation laws commonly display sensitive dependence to the  problem   formulation and to numerical solution algorithms. A completed  theory of a   hyperbolic wave should contain the following ingredients: (1)  jump   conditions describing the influence of the wave on the flow in  which it is   embedded, (2) the width or growth rate of the layer, (3) a  complete theory of   the internal structure, and (4) a systematic unfolding of all  possible sensitive   dependencies for the wave. The mathematical tools and theories  used in the   analysis are varied, and include: partial differential equations  (hyperbolic   conservation laws), random fields, perturbation theory (ordinary  and   renormalized), renormalization group methods, traveling wave  analysis,   bifurcation theory, and the geometric theory of ordinary  differential   equations.    A representative mixing layer problem is acceleration driven  layers, arising   in instabilities of a fluid interface.  Such mixing layers arise  in many areas   of basic science and technology, including supernovae, inertial  confinement   fusion, and injection jets in carburetors for internal combustion  engines.   Detailed mathematical modeling and analysis will seek to modify  and refine   the defining mathematical equations describing such flows and  develop an   improved understanding of the structure of these equations.  This  analysis   will in turn be used to develop high resolution numerical methods  for the   solution of these equations. The nonlinear material wave patterns  we study   describe important metal forming processes such as punching and  cutting   (shear bands) and flow instabilities in forming plastic  components by   injection molding (viscoelastic materials). The analysis of waves  in   nonlinear materials uses a similar integrated approach: modeling,   theor y,   computations, and applications. Interactions with collaborators  will allow   transfer of this technology to appropriate applied physics and  engineering   communities.",
