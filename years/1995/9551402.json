Birdd                                    DUE 9551402  SUNY Research Foundation                           FY1995 $ 26,534  Albany, NY  122010009                              ILI - Instrumentation                                                      Project:                                                      Interdisciplinary    Title: Improvement of a Science Teaching Center for Pre-Service     Teachers           Science instruction at the secondary level must change if we  expect to improve the level of science literacy in the U.S.  Many  students now age 13 will be the consumers of science-based  technological advancements in the year 2061 and beyond!   Furthermore, a science teacher who graduates in 1995 may not retire  until the year 2030.  With this in mind, it is essential that  pre-service teachers learn to use the most current classroom  technology.  This project is the upgrading of the Science Teaching  Center (STC).           The courses which use this laboratory emphasize hands-on  activities in a laboratory of 15 computers and other demonstration  equipment.  Faculty work with pre-service science education majors  to better prepare them for entry into the modern science classroom.   Three courses (SED 307, SED 308, and seminars for SED 408) are  targeted in this proposal.           Each of four activity centers in the STC are being furnished  with two networked computers.  Five computers are being placed in  the student work area, and two computers are being placed in the  curriculum library.  Data collected by the pre-service students is  stored and displayed on the networked computers.  These data are  the basis for increasing the students' understanding of science  concepts and how to teach these concepts to students in grades  7-12.  The STC is also being furnished with computer accessories  (i.e., transparency adaptor, MacHandwriter pen input pad, color  scanner, color printer, and nView LCD projector), commonly found in  secondary schools.           Project evalu ation includes usage of the facility, student  surveys of student perception of the impact on their learning and  preparation for teaching, and follow-ups of the students in their  field and teaching experiences.  The outcome of this project will  be disseminated through presentations at professional meetings and  in educational journals.",
