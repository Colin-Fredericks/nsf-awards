Practical Decision-Theoretic Planning    The desire to solve practical real-world planning problems places  conflicting demands on domain-independent planning systems.  The  representation used by the planner must be rich enough to capture  all the salient aspects of the application, but at the same time,  it must permit the use of efficient algorithms that will scale up  effectively to handle large problems.  In planning under  uncertainty, decision theory allows the consideration of  tradeoffs among partially satisfiable objectives.  But most of  the planning algorithms have either made unrealistic assumptions  or been too inefficient for application to large problems.  The  purpose of this research is to develop efficient methods by using  abstraction techniques which permit a planner to focus on  important aspects of a domain before considering details.  Methods of automatically generating abstractions are being  developed, along with methods of applying these to planning  problems in dynamic environments.  Decision-theoretic planners  are being extended ion their representational capabilities with  the goal of not sacrificing efficiency. Techniques for efficient  reasoning with probabilistic domain theories are being developed.  The tangible products are expected to be a theoretical framework  for efficient decision-theoretic planning, ore or more  implemented planning systems, a theoretical framework for  probabilistic domain modeling using probability logic, and an  implemented inference system for constructing Bayesian networks  from knowledge bases of probability logic sentences.",
