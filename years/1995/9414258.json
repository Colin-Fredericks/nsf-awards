 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor R. Stephen Berry at the Department of Chemistry, University of   Chicago, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program at NSF for theoretical studies of atomic and molecular   clusters. The work supported by this grant falls into four groups of   related topics: (1) The dynamical properties of atomic and molecular   clusters with emphasis on structural phases. (2) The chaotic and ergotic   behavior of clusters. (3) The relationship between the topography of   cluster potential energy surfaces and the formation of special cluster   structures. Of special significance is the study of cluster sintering.   Finally, (4) electron correlation in atoms and molecules, specifically   including the study of 3 and 4 valence electron atoms.  An omnipresent   theme is that the theoretical studies are directly related to   experimental studies.   Clusters are special and unique forms of matter which lie between   isolated atoms and molecules at one extreme and the solid state at the   other extreme. While the properties of clusters are important for their   own sake, they are also important because they bridge these two extremes.   A long term objective of the cluster work which this grant supports is to   understand how cluster properties determine, and ultimately merge with,   bulk properties. The supported work integrates analytic theory,   computation, and computer simulation into an approach with three primary   goals: (1) deepening the understanding of commonplace properties of   matter; (2) identifying new properties specific to matter at the scale of   clusters and nanoscale particles; and (3)  stimulating new experiments.",
