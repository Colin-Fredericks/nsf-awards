 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501504  Lindenfeld  The  proposed  research addresses the question to what extent  and  in  what manner the occurrence and properties of the superconducting state  of  high-Tc  materials  are influenced by the continuing  presence  of  properties related to the magnetic order of the insulating state.  The  compounds may be transformed from one state to the other by changes in  the  concentration of their constituent elements, by the  addition  of  other  elements, or by the application of high magnetic fields.   Each  of these paths will be followed, and a a variety of properties will be  measured, with emphasis on the magnetoresistance over a wide range  of  temperatures.   Aligned  thin  films  of  high-Tc  materials  will  be  prepared at Rutgers by pulsed laser deposition.  Initial emphasis will  be placed on lanthanum strontium copper oxide material that has led to  the  production of thin films with transition temperatures  and  other  properties that are of particularly high quality.  %%%  The  proposed research investigates the extent and manner in which the  occurrence and properties of the low-temperature superconductivity  of  so-called  \"high-Tc\"  materials  are influenced  by  the  presence  of  properties  related to the magnetic characteristics of the  insulating  form of the material. These compounds may be changed from insulator to  superconductor  by  changes in the concentration of their  constituent  elements, by the addition of other elements, or by the application  of  strong   magnetic   fields.   Each  of  these   approaches   will   be  investigated,  and  a  variety of properties will  be  measured,  with  emphasis  on the electrical resistance in the presence of  an  applied  magnetic  field  (magnetoresistance). Thin films of high-Tc  compounds  prepared  at  Rutgers by pulsed laser deposition  techniques  will  be  studied, with initial emphasis on lanthanum strontium copper oxide,  a  material  whose  superconducting  transition  temperature  and   other  propertie s are of particularly high quality.  ***",
