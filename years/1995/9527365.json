 "awd_abstract_narration": "Influences of earthworms on soil processes in agricultural and pastoral systems are  well recognized but there is considerably less information about their importance in wildland  ecosystems such as forests, grasslands and savannas.  Furthermore, very little is known about the  ecology of native earthworm species in North America, even though they are prevalent in a number of  areas unaffected by Pleistocene glaciations.  The few existing studies indicate that where they are  abundant, these organisms can have significant effects on soil structural  properties and on nutrient  transformations.  However. the relative importance of native versus invasive exotic earthworm species  remain virtually unknown.  This proposal requests funding for a cross-site investigation of native and  exotic earthworms, to determine if native species are more efficient than exotic species in nutrient  processing in undisturbed ecosystems.  They also will determine if disturbance sets the stage for  invasion by exotic earthworms, which may be more competitive than natives but less effective in  nutrient cycling.  Th ese ideas will be tested in two phases over a three year period at three LTER  sites (Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, Konza prairie Research Natural Area and Luquillo Experimental  Forest) and one non-LTER site (Apalachicola National Forest).  They will undertake field surveys and  collections in a variety of habitats, and will initiate field enclosure experiments using 13C- and  14N- enriched substrates.  Together, these two phases of work optimize the use of stable isotopes in  field studies--first, as survey tools to characterize and identify important species and patterns of  resource utilization across sites; and then as biogeochemical tracers to elaborate earthworm-microbial  interactions and to quantify influences of various earthworm species on C and N dynamics.  Results  from this study will greatly expand their understanding of earthworm ecology, interactions between  native and exotic species, and influences of both groups on soil nutrient processes across a broad  range of ecosystems.",
