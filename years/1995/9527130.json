 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to help scientists and   engineers carry out computational tasks more effectively by   doing research on:   -  The integration of symbolic and numeric computation to    facilitate problem specification, exploration and result    verification.   -  Hierarchies of reusable computational abstractions   organized  in libraries with well-defined navigational   structures.  -  Exploiting commercial standards and tools for object-request  brokers,   compound documents, and collaboration   infrastructure.  The project takes a novel approach to problem-solving    environments (PSEs).  Its focus is on the entire process of    problem-solving from initial conception,  symbolic specification,  solution, visualization, comparison   with experimental data, and  feed back. The project focuses   on problem-solving environments,  not merely programming   environments.  This focus leads to  research on reusable   abstractions at all levels of problem-solving.  Important   abstractions include  the problem-solving  method itself, method-specific   abstractions for sequential  and  parallel program design, reasoning and debugging,   performance  analysis and  tuning, and frameworks for class libraries.    PSEs are more   useful when they  are more specific. However, rather  than build one problem-  solving environment  for one class of user,  application domain, programming   language and machine,  this  project aims at the basic research that will enable us   to develop  tools  for building specific PSEs.  To use a metaphor, rather than    doing research on  workbenches we want to do research on machine  tools that can   be used to build  workbenches.    Traditional PSEs deal with extending a   workstation environment  whereas this project is concerned with developing structured    environments for problem-solving. Scientists and  engineers   collaborate when  they solve problems, and they share  much more than code.   PSEs based on  collaboration also provide  object-request brokering and   compound multimedia document  interfaces. Since this vision   is both novel and ambitious, a  critical  aspect of the project is leveraging methods and tools    developed for scientific,  commercial and home-computing  applications.",
