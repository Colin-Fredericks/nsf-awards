This interaction usually results in the production of multiple intercellular signals, which the produce the hormonal effects characteristic of the particular hormone and the particular target cell.  Although much is know about the mode of action of these intercellular signals, relatively little is known about the molecular details involved in the primary hormonal stimulation of cell surface receptor.  This is primarily due to the difficulty of working with these receptor molecular in there native location, the hydrophobic cell surface membrane.  Our aim is to determine how binding of a hormone to the outside of a cell can result in the activation of multiple signaling pathways on the inside of that cell.  The system used in this proposal has served as model analysis. %%% This proposal addresses a basic problem in biology, that is how a cell recognizes specific substances around it.  This requires a very precise recognition mechanism permitti ng the cell to distinguish between different types of nutrients.  In addition, cells must recognize and respond to a variety of different external stimuli.  Without such a mechanism of recognition a cell would starve or be killed.  This proposal examines the mechanism of cellular recognition. ***                           ;                                                                Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       9418460                             Shirley Parker                      Shirley Parker              @     P V                           @                                   @     P V                                                                                                   @    F #                                    Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      2                                                                                       ;                               ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          e 3       e                   (                                                           j       j   j       j       j       j       j                                                                       l   1                                                                                                   .
