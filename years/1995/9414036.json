 "awd_abstract_narration": "During this three-year program, the atmospheric chemistry of  selected organic compounds emitted into the atmosphte from  vegetation will be experimentally investigated.  On regional and  global scales, the emissions of non-methane organic compounds from  vegetation will be expermentally investigated.  On regional and  global scales, the emissions of non-methane organic compounds from  vegetation, which are largely comprised of isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-  butadiene and C10H16 monoterpenes, are comparable to or exceed the  emissions of non-methane organic compounds from anthropogenic  sources.  The chemistry of the planetary boundary layer may well be  dominated by these biogenic emissions.  Additionally, the emissions  of isoprene and monoterpenes from vegetation have been implicated  in the formation of ozone and other manifestations of photochemical  air pollutiion in rural and urban areas.  Sine the rate constants  fro the atmosphereically-important gas-phase reactions of isoprene  and the monoterpenes with hydrozyl (NO3) radicals and ozone (O3) are  now reliably known, this project will focus on the products formed  from the OH radical, NO3 radical and O3 reactions with these  biogenic organic compounds and the elecidation of the reaction  mechanisms.    Experiments to identify and quantify the products of the gas-phase  reactions of OH radicals, NO3 radicals and O",
