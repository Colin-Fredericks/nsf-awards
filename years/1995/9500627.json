 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500627  Bazan  The aim of this proposal is to take advantage of our  recently developed paracyclophan-1-ene based PPV-poly(para  phenylenevinylene) methodology to resolve issues of  technical importance.  Emphasis will be placed on new  macromolecular approaches that improve the environmental  stability of conjugated polymers while maintaining photo  optical features of interest.  We are also interested in  investigating stereoregularity issues on polychromophores,  their influence on secondary structure and, ultimately, bulk  properties.  During the grant period, specific aims are: (1)  To expand the scope of  our mild and living polymerization  route to defect-free PPV so that electronpoor versions of  PPV can be prepared in this way.  (2)  To study, by use of  molecular modeling, how the secondary structure in  poly(paracyclophan-1-ene)s enforces chromophore aggregation.  (3)  To investigate whether photogenerated acids are capable  of catalyzing a solid state dehydration reaction  to form  PPV so as to permit patterning using microlithographic  processes.  (4)  To examine the effect of chain length and  degree of aggregation on the emission quantum yield and  durability of  PPV prepared via our new route, in the hope  of optimizing these properties.  (5)  To begin an  investigation into the microheterogeneous properties of  block copolymers containing PPV fragments. (6)  To  characterize, using standard solution methods, the ability  of PPV chains to form excited state dimers (excimers) with  both donor and acceptor molecules.  %%%  Conducting polymers are reaching maturity as a scientific  field.  Fundamental advances in synthetic methodology,  primarily brought about by chemists, have permitted their  use by physicists and engineers as components in electronic  and electro-optic devices such as light emitting diodes,  electrophotographic photoreceptors, solar energy conversion  systems, polymer based capacitors and photodetectors.  The  interest in applying polymers to these functional de vices  stems from their superior processability and low density,  relative to inorganic materials, as well as their intrinsic  amorphous nature.  However, the structural and bonding  features that lead to a small band gap not only reduce  significantly the solubility and processability of the  material but inevitably make chemical oxidation of this  class of materials facile.  This reactivity places severe  limits on their environmental stability and general longterm  durability.  Successful implementation of these molecular-  based electronic and electro-active devices will therefore  depend to a large extent on our ability to design and  synthesize a new generation of conjugated polymers that are  environmentally stable.    During this grant period, the junior-level advanced  inorganic/organic methods and instrumentation course will  continue to be innovated to include for the first time x-ray  structure determination.  This course will combine rigorous  chemical manipulations with an introduction to stae-of-the  art instrumentation.  Funds for the purchase of computer  equipment have already been raised.  ***",
