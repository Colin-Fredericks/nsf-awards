 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501226  Wayne  Professor Wayne's research will focus on a variety of partial  differential equations which arise in mathematical physics.  He  will  attempt to use ideas from dynamical systems theory to understand  the  geometrical structure of the phase space of these systems, and  how this  structure influences the solutions of these equations.  He will  study  two main classes of equations -- Hamiltonian partial differential  equations, and dissipative equations.  In the first context, he  will be  concerned with extending the applications of tools like the  Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory which have proven useful in the  context  of finite dimensional Hamiltonian dynamical systems to this  infinite  dimensional context and also in understanding the stability of  the  resulting solutions.  In the context of dissipative equations he  will  apply both invariant manifold theorems and the renormalization  group to  study the long-time asymptotics of such equations, particularly  in  cases in which the linearized equation has continuous spectrum.  %%%  Wayne's research will focus on the behavior of solutions of  differential equations which arise in mathematical physics.   These  equations have solutions which may behave in a very complicated  fashion, and Professor Wayne will develop new techniques for  understanding their behavior.  In simpler examples the key to  this  understanding has often been the elucidation of certain key  geometrical  structures related to the solutions of these equations, and  Professor  Wayne's research will concentrate on discovering whether  analogues of  these structures exist in the more complicated, infinite  dimensional  contexts that arise in his applications.  The sorts of equations  which  he will study arise in the propagation of waves on the surface of  a  fluid, the vibrations of crystals, and chemical reactions.  ***",
