 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505535  Kambysellis       Dr. Kambyselis requests funds for a small Grant for  Exploratory Research (SGER).  The project aims to develop an  experimental methodology whereby specific genes can be transferred  from the genome of one Drosophila species into another, without the  use of genetic markers in the recipient species as traditionally  required for such genetic manipulations.  Whereas there is a vast  array of genetic mutants available for the species Drosophila  melanogaster, most other Drosophila species of interest to  evolutionary and developmental biologist lack available mutants,  limiting their genetic analysis.  To rectify this situation and  facilitate analysis of gene expression and the evolution of gene  regulation in the endemic Hawaiian Drosophila and other groups,  novel vectors using as markers neomycin resistance or the green  fluorescent protein will be developed to establish a transformation  system applicable to any Drosophila species.         The successful development of this methodology will have broad  application, facilitating genetic analyses of basic phenomena such  as behavior, evolution, and the role of pattern formation is  development, as examples.  Even wider application may ensure if the  general approach of transgenic insect formation can subsequently be  extended to insects of economic importance, enabling novel  approaches to agricultural problems.",
