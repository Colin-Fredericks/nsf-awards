 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Anthropology at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) and NSF will jointly support the renovation of vacated chemistry research space for new laboratories in archaeology, biological anthropology (osteology and primatology), ethnographic cultural analysis, museology, and visual anthropology.  The NSF award is a critical first step in a five-year plan to improve laboratory space essential to research and research training efforts for students at the B.A. and M.A. levels.     The impacted laboratories are currently located at diverse locations on the campus.  With the move of the Chemistry department to new research space, the Anthropology department will be able to consolidate and upgrade its facilities.  Renovation activities will involve space conversion including the removal of asbestos and out-dated laboratory benches and the installation of new plumbing, electrical, HVAC and hazard waste disposal systems.  The newly renovated space will include audioroom facilities, a darkroom, and computer-ready workstations to support research in ethnographic cultural analysis, museology, biological anthropology, and visual anthropology.  These enhanced facilities will support long-term archaeological research projects to understand the impact of historical cultural factors in an increasingly complex society.",
