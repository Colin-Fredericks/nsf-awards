 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enriches the educational experience in three facets  of the Manufacturing Systems Engineering and the Mechanical  Engineering curricula.   The addition of a Stereolithography  Apparatus allows Polymer Processing, Computer Integrated  Manufacturing (CIM), and Metal Casting Processes students (among  others) to participate actively in multiple phases of a  manufacturing system.   Part design information along with mold  design requirements, derived and gathered by Polymer Processing  students, is fed to students of Computer Integrated  Manufacturing.   Working with the Polymer students, and equipped  with SLA requirements, CIM students develop appropriate solid  models for prototyping.   Finally, metal casting students are  provided with prototypes useful in developing permanent molds.    Use of the new equipment extends through all levels of secondary  and postsecondary education.   Junior and senior level Mechanical  and Manufacturing Systems Engineering students are provided with  experiences integrating all aspects of rapid prototyping  technology.   The addition of SLA to GMrs Polymer  Processing/Computer Integrated Manufacturing laboratories  provides exposure manufacturing systems engineering to the  students of GMI and inspiration in the area of Manufacturing  Systems Engineering to young people considering further education  in this field.",
