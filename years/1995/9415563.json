The focus of the research  stems from preliminary data suggesting that the overall burial and  preservation of phosphorus in marine sediments is strongly  dependent on the concentration of oxygen in waters overlying the  sediments.  These studies indicate that oxygen depleted bottom  waters enhance phosphorus regeneration from sediments, diminishing  overall burial efficiency.  If this effect can be verified it has  important implications for eutrophication in coastal regions and  for  the long term cycling of P especially during periods of  widespread ocean anoxia.  Sites overlain by anoxic and oxic bottom  waters in the Gulf of Mexico and the greater Puget Sound region  will be examined using in situ benthic flux chambers, pore water  and sediment measurements. Steady state fluxes of P and associated  elements will be determined from in situ benthic chamber  experiments. Benthic fluxes will be combined with sediments burial  fluxes in order to calculate P burial efficiencies for the  different study sites.  A major objective of this research is to  identify  the mechanisms responsible for the burial and  preservation of phosphorus and how they may differ in the presence  and absence of oxygen.  Particular attention will be paid to  processes potentially sensitive to changing redox conditions such  as the cycling of P by bacteria and dissolved iron. Data gathered  during the field and subsequent lab studies will be integrated into  a numerical transport reaction model in order to constrain the  kinetics of early phosphorus diagenesis. The results will be used  to evaluate the potential effects of variations in sedimentary P  flux on long term global marine productivity.",
