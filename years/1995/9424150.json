The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Beren W. Robinson of Binghamton University to  work with Professor Dolph Schluter at the University of  British Columbia on the evolution of ecological  specialization in freshwater sticklebacks that are  morphologically polymorphic.    Phenotypic differentiation in lake fishes frequently falls  along an ecological gradient that is defined at one end by  the shallow littoral habitat along the lake margin  (\"Benthic\"), and at the other end by the deep open waters  found at the center of lakes (\"limnetic\").  These habitats  are believed to exert strong and alternative selective  pressures on the species that specialize in each habitat  because of functional constraints on fish morphology and  behavior.  A reciprocal transplant growth experiment in the  field will be performed and a correlation analysis between  phenotype and various components of fitness using limnetic  and benthic morphs of freshwater sticklebacks.  This  research will demonstrate trade-offs among morphs drawn from  a single population of fish and will shed new light on how  specialist phenotypes evolve within fishes and other taxa.  ***",
