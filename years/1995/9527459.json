 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527459  Knapp    This award will allow San Jose State University to develop a two course sequence in the field of Human Computer Interfaces (HCI).  These courses will by project-oriented and taught in a lecture/laboratory mode.  The projects, along with much of the course content, will by based on the research being performed at the San Jose State University in the HCI areas of biosignal input, sound localization, sonification and visualization.  The lectures will cover subjects from pattern recognition to non-linear filtering to graphics algorithms.    The laboratory projects will be developed by the course instructors with the close assistance of the Department of Occupational Therapy, and the Computer Art and Design Center (CADRE).  Project teams of engineering students will be augmented by \"clients\" from these department who will define the requirements for the projects and evaluate each team's progress toward success.    These courses will be taught at San Jose State University and at University of California, Santa Cruz via the new CALREN interactively networked teaching facility.  Once the course has been fully developed, sites across the Silicon Valley will be able to present these courses.",
