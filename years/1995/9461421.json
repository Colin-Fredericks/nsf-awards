 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the crude and #6 oil storage tanks, precipitation of the suspended particles, water and other chemicals results in continuous building up of sludge material on the tank bottom. Over time the sludge material condenses into a hard asphalt like compound. The material contains highly corrosive elements that deteriorates the surface preparations and corrodes the tank and seam welds. The build-up may reach several feet, reducing tank capacity and creating enormous cleaning and inspection problems. The disposal of the hazardous sludge material requires great care and is very costly (a major clean-up costs between one half and one million dollars). The objective of this SBIR effort is to develop an integrated robotic system that entirely eliminates the build-up of the hard sludge material and cleans and prepares tank surfaces and welds for in-situ inspection. The system can operate in the present tanks without requiring any modification. The present safety and sludge material disposal problems are eliminated. The Phase I effort involves a detailed technical and economical feasibility study of the proposed system. As part of the Phase II effort, a working prototype will be constructed and fully tested. Both efforts are performed with close collaboration of a local utility company.",
