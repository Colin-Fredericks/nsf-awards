 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  This award supports a study of the technical feasibility of  collecting and analyzing broad-band teleseismic data from the  Antarctic continental interior using portable seismometers.  The  West Antarctic Ice Sheet overlies a region of the Antarctic  continent which may be in extension.  However, very little is  actually known about the seismic structure of the crust and upper  mantle.  The deployment of portable broad-band seismometers for  passive teleseismic studies may offer the most effective means of  acquiring data on the deep structure of this continent.    Data collected with broad-band PASSCAL seismometers deployed as  an augmentation to the ICEQUAKE network in central West  Antarctica represents useful records with several well defined  teleseismic events (about 10-20 events) that were recorded over a  period of five weeks.  The data are of sufficient quality to  allow the estimation of fundamental mode dispersion curves down  to periods as low as 50 seconds, and the analysis of body phases  for boundary interactions and travel time anomalies.  This should  provide first-order constraints on the shear velocity structure  of the crust and upper mantle down to a depth of approximately  200 km.  Additionally, the data contain sufficient information to  develop ambient noise models for ice sheets.  Consequently, if  successful, this work will lead to important guidance for the  technical design elements necessary for developing an important  experimental resource for seismic studies that may lead to  significant advances in understanding the Antarctic continent.",
