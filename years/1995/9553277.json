 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wildlife Conservation Society, founded 1895 as the New York  Zoological Society, requests a grant from the National Science  Foundation, to launch and exciting two-fold science education and  career exploration project for undeserved youngsters entering 8th  and 9th grades.  This commuter summer camp experience, serving 35  children annually over a three year period, will be held at the  internationally acclaimed Bronx Zoo and be based on one of the  exemplary and PEP1 validated life science curricula developed by  the Bronx Zoo Education Department, Wildlife Inquiry through Zoo  Education (WIZE).  To date, over 1,000 teachers in 40 states and  U.S. territories have adopted the curriculum in grades 7-10.  WIZE,  a science program targeted for adolescents, became available in  1987.  Initially funded by NSF, WIZE has been successfully  disseminated nationally through two consecutive grants from the   U. S. Department of Education National Diffusion Network, and  continually evaluate over the past seven years.    The goals of Wildlife Conservation Society, the Bronx Zoo Education  Department, the WIZE curriculum, and the proposed WIZE Teens Summer  Science Camp closely coordinate with those of NSF's division Human  Resources Development:  We are actively seeking to: 1) promote an  interest in science and mathematics in middle school students that  will remain with them beyond their school years; 2 prepare  adolescents to understand and participate as informed citizens in  public policy debates and decisions on issues involving the  environment, habitats, and wildlife preservation; 3) encourage  middle school students to value and continue their science  education throughout secondary school and consider higher education  leading to careers in science, mathematics, or technology.  ***",
