 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stephen DiNardo  IBN 9418271    Cells within certain lineages must be continually replenished  throughout the life of an organism.  This is accomplished through  the establishment and maintenance of stem cells.  The mechanisms  that instruct stem cell fate and that regulate the proliferation of  their daughter cells are poorly understood.  The overall objective  of this proposal is to investigate how stem cells are established  and maintained, using the model of Drosophila spermatogenesis that  provides a unique opportunity to combine experimental and genetic  approaches.  The experimental manipulations first proposed will  attempt to answer two questions:  does cell signaling instruct stem  cell fate?  and are the number of daughter cell divisions  internally programmed or controlled by neighboring cells?  The  first will be addressed by ablating the male hub cells, using a  diptheria toxin inducible system, to determine whether the  maintenance of the germline stem cell fate is governed by the  signals emanating from these somatic cells.  Heterospecific  transplantation experiments, using two species that differ in the  number of stem cell divisions, will determine if counting is  intrinsic to daughter germ cells, or imposed by signals from the  two somatic cells that surround them.  The genetic approaches  proposed will identify further mutations that interfere with these  decisions.  To identify genes that cause under- or  over-proliferation of germ cells, or that cause discrete  changes in the number of mitotic divisions, a powerful genetic  screen, using the FLP/FRT recombinase system, is proposed.   Molecular markers will be used to determine whether the primary  defect in the mutants selected is in the production, maintenace or  division of stem cells, or, alternatively, in the capacity of the  daughter cells to divide.       ***",
