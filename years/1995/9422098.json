 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry  Program, Dr. Richard C. Holz of Utah State University will undertake a study of the roles that the  individual metal ions in multinuclear hydrolytic enzymes play in their catalytic reactions.  The  initial phase of the work will be built around studies of the dinuclear Zn(II) aminopeptidase from  Vibrio proteolytica, for which a plasmid is available that  can be used to overexpress the enzyme  in E. coli.  The approach will involve substitution of individual zinc ions in the enzyme with  spectroscopically active Co(II), Ni(II) or Cu(II) ions, which have already been demonstrated to  also show enhanced enzymatic activity.   Cadmium(II) will also be used for substitution in some  studies.  Methods to be used include UV-VIS, NMR, EPR and EXAFS spectroscopies, as well as  steady state kinetics.  Specific questions to be considered include:  1) What is the nature and  geometry of the ligands upon substitution with other metal ions such that hyperactivity is  obtained.  2) What specific role does each metal center play in catalysis?  3) How do substrates  interact with the dinuclear active site?  and 4) Does one or both metal ions serve as a Lewis acid  to bind and activate a water molecule for the hydrolysis reaction?    Hydrolytic enzymes that contain more than one metal ion (multinuclear enzymes) have been  demonstrated to exist only recently.  The mechanisms by which these enzymes effect catalysis  are presently unknown.  This research is designed to determine the role that the individual metal  ions play in the catalytic reaction.  The results may lead to the development of synthetic  enzymes that can be used in biotechnology.",
