It  influences category learning, transfer of knowledge, inductive  inference, decision-making, and case-based reasoning and  planning.  Because of its centrality, it is important to  understand the psychology of similarity.  The approach on which  this research is based models similarity as a process rather than  considering it as a simple value to be measured.  Thus, the  approach departs from prior research by others in its emphasis on  dynamic models of the psychological processes that underlie  similarity, and also in utilizing rich representations of the  items being compared.  The research involves two computational  models of the process of similarity comparison, SME and SIAM,  that show how the comparison process proceeds from local to  global alignment.  A focus of the research is further exploration  of the time course of similarity comparison and analysis of its  implications for on-line processing.  For example, speeded  similarity judgments show sensitivity patterns different from  slow judgments, an observation relevant to interface design in  contexts where humans are placed under speed stress.  Previous  work on this project investigated two key factors in similarity  processing.  The first was interconnectivity, the fact that  interactions between features can make some features more salient  in similarity judgments and even change the psychological  interpretation of the features.  The second issue was the effect  of alignment on judgments of the perceptual similarity of two  figures.  The new research to be performed under this  Accomplishment-Based Renewal is organized around two major  questions:  1.  How do structure and process interact to  determine similarity; and 2. How do results on similarity  processing extend to other tasks that use similarity as a  component.  For example, new experiments will investigate how the  seeming similarity between two figures changes with context, by  manipulati ng the kind of alignment that is easy or hard to do.   Yet another line of research will examine the effect of  similarity comparisons on constructive induction associated with  similarity judgments, category-based induction, memory retrieval,  and decision making.  Overall, the project will inform our  understanding of the range and flexibility of similarity  processing and examine its role in other cognitive functions.    ***",
