 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500920 Showalter  Mathematical models of diffusion in  heterogeneous media will be developed as nonlinear systems of  partial differential equations. These diffusion processes include  examples of diffusion through porous or fissured media (with  saturation, absorption, or phase change) and conduction through  composite semiconductor materials. The singular or degenerate  nature of these systems arise from material properties and from  the geometry of the composition. Major objectives include the  development by homogenization theory of two-scale models, proof  of well-posedness results in appropriate function spaces, and the  investigation of properties of solutions for the various systems.    Mathematical models of diffusion in composite media will be  developed. These diffusion processes include examples of heat  conduction (with solid - liquid phase change), diffusion of fluid  through porous or fissured media (with saturation), absorption by  granulated substance, and the macroscopic description of current  flow in semi-conductor materials. The singular or degenerate  nature of these systems arise from properties of the materials  and from the geometry of the composition. Major objectives  include the development of exact small-scale models to describe  the flow across the intricate interface between the components of  the media and averaged large-scale models which are necessary for  the computation of solutions.",
