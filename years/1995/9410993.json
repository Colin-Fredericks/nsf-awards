 "awd_abstract_narration": "Active database systems transform passive database processing into active environments by using rules  as alerters and triggers. This research is investigating two complementary aspects of active database  development environments: the analysis of rules for termination and confluence properties and the  run-time testing and debugging of active rules. The research is addressed in the context of an active,  deductive, and object-oriented database. The rule analysis process is a static approach, applying  termination/confluence analysis techniques from conditional term rewriting to identify rule problems  before execution. The run-time environment is a dynamic approach allowing users to step through the  rule triggering process, observing rule behavior and testing different rule triggering sequences. The  execution model includes a propagation algorithm for monitoring changes to derived data. The  integration of rule analysis with rule generation and transaction development to support specification  and analysis of rules prior to rule execution is also being investigated. The significance of this  work is found i n the integration of active, deductive, and object-oriented concepts as well as the  supportive environment provided to address the correctness and predictability of active rules in the  development of complex database applications.",
