 "awd_abstract_narration": "A system based on three cascaded stages, each capable of  providing about two orders of magnitude of isolation in six  degrees of freedom, is being developed.  Each stage utilizes  active and passive isolation to achieve the performance  goals.  The preliminary stage is operational, and the two  main stages are under construction.  Early measurements have  been made on the first main stage.  The preliminary, single  stage, vibration isolation system provides more isolation at  1 Hz than any other research or commercial isolation system.  When complete, the three-stage system will provide the  quietest terrestrial environment ever achieved.  The  continuum thermal noise in suspension pendulums, like those  planned for gravitational wave interferometers, will be  measured by hanging a matched pair of them from the ultra  quiet second main stage and determining their relative  motion.    This advanced active vibration isolation system is being  developed to shield sensitive measurement instruments from  the effects of seismic and man-made vibration noise at  frequencies down to 1 Hz.  The objective of this work is to  develop techniques which can help reduce the effects of the  direct mechanical coupling of ground motions and other  vibration on the test masses of gravitational wave  interferometers down to the level of the gravitational  coupling of disturbances to the test masses over as wide a  frequency range as possible.  During the third year of work,  a conceptual design will be developed for an active  vibration isolation system which could be used in advanced  low-frequency LIGO detectors.  This will include a numerical  model of the expected performance.  Improved performance at  frequencies down to 1 Hz would permit searches for signals  which terminate at frequencies of 10 Hz or less.",
