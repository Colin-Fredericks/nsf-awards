 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research program in computational astrophysics will be  carried out by Prof. William Press and his group.  Topics to  be investigated will include the following:  (1) Continued  development of a new class of fast statistical methods  (discovered by Rybicki and Press) that reduce some formerly  intractable problems in signal and data processing to  computationally fast problems.  (2) Application of these  methods to the study of galaxies at moderate to high  redshifts, where new cosmological information can be  discerned.  (3) Several tests on the reality of large scale  cosmological flows, including the use of Type Ia supernovae.  (4) A systematic investigation of new and unified methods  for measuring the galaxy correlation function (or power  spectrum) on the very largest scales accessible to  observation.  (5) The possible role of cataclysmic variable  stars as an indicator of the early history of evolution of  our Galaxy.  (6) Measurement of mass-to-light ratios on  large cosmological scales.  (7) A study of parallel  computational algorithms and \"idioms\" with application to  scientific computing generally.  (8) Possibly, the  development of large scale computer codes in the areas of  hydrodynamics in wavelet basis, and/or classical three-  dimensional field theory calculations.    Prof. Press and his group work on a variety of topics in  cosmology, theoretical astrophysics, and computational  physics and astrophysics.  Behind this diversity of topics,  lies the central focus of interest:  Given the hot big bang,  did the structure in the Universe today form  gravitationally?  And, if so, how, when, and with what  implications regarding the Universe's initial conditions?  The group has a major interest not only in developing new,  testable, theoretical ideas that bear on this question, but  also in developing new analytical, statistical, and  computational techniques that are capable of extending the  power and relevance of existing and future observational  data sets.  Towards this end, P ress and his co-members have  a continuing interest in fast computational methods,  parallel computing, and the development of new algorithms.  Often these have application not only to gravitational  physics and astrophysics, but also to science and  engineering more broadly.",
