 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the theoretical analysis of  alternative rules for monetary policy.  More specifically, the  aim is to better understand the consequences of policy rules that  involve use of a short-term interest rate as the instrument in  terms of which the monetary authority formulates its policy over  short periods of time.  The project will also consider the extent  to which interest-rate smoothing conflicts with other aims of  policy, including both price-level stabilization and  stabilization of output and employment.         The research seeks to bring the theoretical literature in  monetary economics into closer contact with the problems of  contemporary monetary policy.  The theoretical literature to  date has largely conceived of monetary policy in terms of  alternative paths for a monetary aggregate, which is treated as  being under the direct control of the monetary authority.  But,  while operating procedures of that sort have often been  advocated by academic critics of central bank policies, central  banks have seldom operated in that way.  Recently the U.S.  Federal Reserve has ceased to use monetary aggregates as guides  to policy, even in the role of intermediate targets.  A  theoretical understanding of the properties of the kinds of  procedures currently being used or contemplated is badly needed.  ***",
