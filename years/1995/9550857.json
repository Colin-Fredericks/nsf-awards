 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since plastics account for approximately 20 percent of the  landfill volume, recycling plastics will play a significant role  in reducing solid waste flow to the already congested landfills  in the nation.   Students must be educated in the methods to  recycle plastics and to produce products from recycled materials  in order to protect the environment.  This project enhances  materials recycling experiments by adding a drying experiment, an  injection molding process, and a study of melt property for  recycled plastics.   Over several courses, and with an  integrative overview at each stage, students are being involved  in a series of plastic recycling experiments.  These experiments  include collecting and cleaning postconsumer containers,  grinding, extrusion compounding and pelletizing, drying,  injection molding, controlling melt behavior, and testing the  final properties for recycled plastics.   Students are now able  to produce products from recycled plastics with an injection  molding machine, to control the quality, and to improve  efficiency of the processing of the recycled materials.  Students  in the technology majors and non-science-majors can gain  fundamental understanding and practical experience through this  series of experiments.   They are educated with knowledgeable  insights of reducing, reusing, and recycling plastics to protect  our environment and to conserve natural resources.   This project  could serve as a model of materials education in the nation for  undergraduate students concerning the materials and product  cycles and their impact on the environment.",
