 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550765  Ford    The Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LAMP) is a  comprehensive statewide coordinated program aimed at substantially  increasing the number and quality of minority students earning  baccalaureate degrees in science, engineering and mathematics (SEM)  areas.  In the long term, the program design will lead to  significant increase in minority SEM graduate enrollment in U.S.  graduate schools.  It is estimated that Louisiana institutions will  increase to 500, the minority undergraduate SEM enrollment, while  increasing graduate enrollment nationally to 100, by 1999.      LAMP strategy centers on enhancing and coordinating existing SEM  pipeline activities at Louisiana institutions, supporting  undergraduate student research activities and introducing strategic  statewide and regional academic and research activities to promote  networking and technology exchanges.  The LAMP implementation would  continue the expansion of the State's SEM infrastructure and join  the several systemic initiatives and EPSCoR programs coordinated  through the Louisiana Board of Regents.  Twelve institutions  initially will manage a variety of campus-based programs and  participate in several statewide and regional projects.    Southern University and A&M College, the LAMP lead institution is  an 1890 Land Grant university with a nationally recognized systemic  model for physics education and is slated, under a recently court  approved settlement agreement, to develop doctorate degree programs  in Science and Mathematics Education, Material Science, Biomedical  Sciences and in Administration and Information Systems over the  next 10 years.  Southern University System, parent organization to  Souther University campuses in the major metropolitan areas of  Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and Shreveport, enrolls more than 36% of  all African American college undergraduates in the State of  Louisiana.  Southern University and A&M College will provide  management leadership to array of campus coordina ted minority  participation enhancement activities around the State.    Grambling State University, the fourth public Louisiana HBCU, as  well as private Xavier University and Dillard University, both of  New Orleans will be active LAMP participating institutions.  RCMS  projects at grambling State University, Southern University and A&M  College, Xavier University and the University of New Orleans will  collaborate with LAMP and serve as models for transporting to other  Louisiana institutions.  Louisiana State University, Tulane  University, of Southwestern Louisiana, University of New Orleans  and Southern University and A&M College will manage programs at the  undergraduate/graduate interface and harness the projects of  increased SEM undergraduate degree production.    These impressive projections are conservative in view of a recent  higher education desegregation settlement agreement pledging  substantial state resources to expedite the movement of state HBCU  institutions toward comprehensive graduate status through  establishment of new graduate programs, fund other race recruitment  and scholarships, and support articulation among institutions.  The  plan for expanding diversity on college campuses makes available  additional resources to meet the goals of the LAMP, including  improved facilities, increased student support and enhanced  faculty/mentor support systems.    Establishing LAMP closes a critical gap in the nation's SEM  pipeline.  Implementation of the LAMP moves the nation  substantially toward its goal of awarding 50,000 undergraduate  degrees and 2,000 doctorate degrees annually by 2000.  Louisiana  relatively large African-American population puts the State in a  unique position to make significant contributions to the nations  goal of increased minority participation in the SEM enterprise.   the timing of this application makes it possible for unprecedented  federal/state synergism to result in substantially increased  resources and program development activities consis tent with NSF  AMP goals.",
