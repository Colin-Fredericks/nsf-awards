 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423297  Jackson    An adequate supply of oxygen to heart muscle is essential to  normal  cardiac function.  In mammals, the coronary arteries  carry  well-oxygenated  blood to the  heart  muscle.   Their  importance  is  illustrated by the  fact  that  insufficient  oxygenation  of  heart  muscle due  to  obstruction  of  the  coronary  arteries is a leading cause of  death  in  humans.  Oxygenation  of  heart  muscle is also  important  for  non-  mammalian  animals, and may have had a major impact  on  the  evolution  of  the  vertebrate  cardiovascular  system.   In  contrast  to  mammals,  the hearts of fish,  amphibians  and  reptiles  have no arterial circulation to the heart  muscle.  Instead,  venous  blood flowing through the  heart  chambers  supplies  the  oxygen  needs of the spongy  cardiac  muscle.  This  poses a problem during exercise, which both  increases  cardiac oxygen demand and decreases oxygen levels in  venous  blood  returning to the heart.  This research will test  the  hypothesis  that  selection for maintaining  cardiac  oxygen  supply  and performance led to two major innovations in  the  cardiovascular systems of vertebrates: 1) the  evolution  of  lungs  and  2)  the persistence in terrestrial reptiles  and  amphibians  of the intracardiac shunt, which permits  mixing  of  oxygenated  blood from the lungs with poorly  oxygenated  blood  returning  from  the  tissues.   This  research  will  establish  the  oxygen requirements of the hearts  of  lower  vertebrates  and determine the relative importance  of  lung  ventilation, intracardiac shunting and coronary  circulation  as  mechanisms to meet those requirements.  If  the  central  hypothesis  is correct, it will lead to a new  paradigm  for  the  evolution of lungs and help explain the persistence  of  the    complex   cardiovascular   systems   of   ectothermic  vertebrates.   The  outcome may alter the  traditional  view  that the cardiac anatomy of modern animals has resulted from  selection for innovations  that improve nutrient delivery  to  the   systemic  circulation,  without  recognition  of   the  importance of nutrient delivery to the heart itself.",
