 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will show that adaptive optics can make a major contribution to ground based optical and infrared astronomy by making it affordable. Astronomers have been increasing the size of telescopes for years in an effort to increase both resolution and light collection capabilities. This approach is limited due to Earth's atmosphere degrading the image at seeing time. As apertures increase larger than the seeing cells in the atmosphere, improved resolution is lost. Adaptive optics can remove most of the degradation. AO systems developed for military applications are not practical for astronomical use due to high cost and brightness of the reference object needed. One key component to any AO system is the deformable mirror which can remove atmospheric wavefront errors. Military contractors sell deformable mirrors at costs over $100,000. Valpey-Fisher Corporation believes these mirrors made in bimorph form can be produced for under $10,000. They will work in collaboration with J. Elon Graves and his adaptive optics group at the University of Hawaii. Their experience in machining and polishing PZT materials will allow them to produce these mirrors.",
