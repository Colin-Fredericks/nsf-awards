 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501438  Westervelt  Coupled   two  and  three  quantum  dots,  artificial  molecules,  including chains and rings of dots will be fabricated on gallium-  arsenide/aluminum-gallium-arsenide  heterostructures  from  UCSB.  Such   structures  on  semiconductors  will  enable  the  PI   to  compensate for the effect of impurities and defects on the energy  of  the  electrons and the dot to dot coupling. Coulomb  blockade  and  dot  capacitance at ultra-low temperatures will be  used  as  spectroscopic  tools  for electron states in  single  and  couple  quantum  dots.  Additional  probes such  as  localized  microwave  excitation  via  miniaturized striplines, and spatially  resolved  scanning probe measurements currently under development  will  be  used to characterize electron states and transport in single  and  coupled  dots.  The  objective is  to  elucidate  the  nature  of  electron  states  in  coupled dots and  to  search  for  possible  collective  quantum phenomena. The behavior of  electrons  inside  these structures is of great current interest, both for practical  and  for  fundamental reasons. The controlled  motion  of  single  electrons  through  coupled quantum dots is  the  basis  for  new  approaches to electronics and computation.  %%%  This project investigates semiconductor \"quantum dot\", structures  which  are  so small that they are also referred to as artificial  atoms  and  molecules. Their fabrication is complex and  involves  collaboration  between workers at Harvard and UC  Santa  Barbara.  The  behavior of electrons inside these structures  is  of  great  current interest, both for practical and for fundamental reasons.  The controlled motion of single electrons through coupled quantum  dots  is  the  basis  for  new  approaches  to  electronics   and  computation.  For example, a goal is to develop  single  electron  devices  in  which each bit is represented by a single  electron,  whose  state may be optically switched. Unlike \"real\"  molecules,  the  size and cou pling between the quantum dots can be varied  by  fabrication  methods to produce new phenomena not normally  found  in  molecules.  Measurements  of the  Coulomb  blockade  and  dot  capacitance   at   ultra-low  temperatures  will   be   used   as  spectroscopic  tools for electron states in  single  and  coupled  quantum dots.  ***",
