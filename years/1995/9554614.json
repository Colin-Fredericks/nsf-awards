Classrooms  will be transformed into active learning centers characterized by  involved children working together in cooperative groups.  Teachers  will be using the Sustained.  Comprehensive professional  development will encourage staff to take risks and assume new roles  as they move from a didactic instructional methodology to one that  promotes and rewards inquiry-based learning.  The project will  involve all 1,470 pre-K through grade 6 teachers in the 35  elementary schools of the two districts.  These teachers wil be  implementing a science program made up of Insights and Science and  Technology for Children units that were piloted during the planning  grant that preceded this award.  The approach to mathematics will  parallel the science teaching and will stress problem-solving,  mathematical reasoning, real world applications, communication  about mathematics, integration of mathematical topics, and the use  of manipulatives and technology.    The cost sharing for the project will be 263% of the NSF award.",
