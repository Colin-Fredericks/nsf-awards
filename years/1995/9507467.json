 "awd_abstract_narration": "Klallam is an endangered and little-documented native American  language of the Salishan language family. Although there is great  interest among the Klallam tribes in preserving the language,  Klallam is today still spoken fluently by only a small number of  elders living in the area of three reservations on the north shore  of Washington's Olympic Peninsula.       The aim of this project is the production of a first full  grammar of the Klallam language together with a collection of  transcribed and translated speech in various genres: traditional  narratives, personal anecdotes, community history, jokes, formal  speeches, songs, and conversation. The grammar will be written in  a general typological framework that will make it accessible and  useful both to specialists in Salishan languages and to other  linguists of various theoretical persuasions.       The PI has for the last three years assisted the Klallam  tribes in their efforts to preserve and revitalize their  language. A large amount of various kinds of language data has  been collected and archived. This project will build on this  preliminary work.",
