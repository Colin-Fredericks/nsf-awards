 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry Program   is jointly supported by the Divisions of Earth Sciences, Chemistry, and   Chemical and Transport Systems Engineering.  Jillian F. Banfield, Geology   Department, and Robert J. Hamers, Chemistry Department, of the University   of Wisconsin-Madison will investigate at an atomic level the nature of   reactions occurring at interfaces between aqueous solutions and surfaces   of metal sulfide minerals.  They will use a multidisciplinary approach,   incorporating biological, geological and chemical factors, and integrate   results from a wide array of experimental methods, including STM,  XPS,   and confocal microscopy.   Parallel field and laboratory studies will be   conducted.  Surfaces formed as a consequence of natural inorganically-   and organically-mediated weathering will be compared to   synthetically-weathered minerals to explore the applicability of   laboratory-based studies to natural systems.  The goals of the   investigation are to determine the mechanisms and rates of dissolution,   precipitation, and ion adsorption at metal sulfide surfaces; the effect   of electrochemical oxidation and reduction on surface morphology; the   role of impurities in modifying rates of electrochemical processes at   surfaces; and the role of bacteria in controlling surface microstructural   characteristics and dissolution rates.  Chemical weathering of minerals is the process by which rocks are   converted into the constituents of soils and sediments.  Sulfide minerals   such as galena, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite are mined as sources of   important elements, such as lead, zinc, and copper, releasing the metals   and acidifying  water.  The increase in acidity accelerates weathering of   other minerals.  Understanding the dissolution and crystallization   behavior of metal sulfides, by chemical and bacterial routes, is   important to developing predictive models of metal speciation and   bioavailability.  The goal of this study is to improve understanding of   natural systems and to develop accurate laboratory tests and predictive   models.",
