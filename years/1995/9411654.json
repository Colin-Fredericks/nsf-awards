 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  K. C.  Liddell    This is a study of the electrodeposition of compositionally modulated alloys.  Electrochemical and electron microprobe measurements provide complementary data on composition gradients in the multilayer copper-nickel system, a model for commercial magnetic data-storage systems.  Rotating ring disk electrode techniques enable in-situ  measurements of deposition rate and purity of an alloy in real time; however, such measurements are radially integrated.  Microprobe measurements show of composition as a function of radial position for a given layer and deposit thickness.  The experimental results are used to validate models of electrodeposition.    Electrodeposition shows great promise as a flexible and inexpensive means of producing nanostructured compositionally  modulated alloys.  This is of especial current interest for production of  high-quality magnetic recording heads and related data-storage applications.  However, the relationships between process variables and product  properties are not  understood well enough to permit optimization of electrodeposition processes based on first principles.  This study is intended to make such optimization less empirical.",
