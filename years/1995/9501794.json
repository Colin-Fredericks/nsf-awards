 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main  research goals of this project are to study new analytical   techniques for elucidating the internal structure of complexity classes.  These techniques adapt the theories of Lebesgue measure and Baire  category to  computational complexity.  They provide quantitative methods to  differentiate `typical` from `exceptional` properties of languages in a  particular class, shedding light on the  relationships between the structure and  intrinsic difficulty of  computational problems. These concepts are also closely  related  to the study of pseudorandom and `pseudo-generic` sequences.  Improvements to some of these analytic techniques are explored, and new types  of complexity-theoretic Baire category and their applications are  investigated.  The Educational Component of this CAREER Grant includes the  goals of: (a) Establishing theoretical computer science as an integral  part of the undergraduate curriculum at the  University of Southern  Maine, expanding the theory  offerings and more closely tying theory with  applications and with other subjects; (b) Implementing innovative ways  to attract nonmajors to  the computer science department, especially those who  are  interested in computer science, but may not be ready for a  traditional first programming course.   The routes to these goals run through  teaching, advising,  mentoring, and curriculum development. (This educational  component is part of the Research at Undergraduate Institutions  Program.)",
