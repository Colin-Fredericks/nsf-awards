Seasonal  snow accumulation and ablation in both the mid-latitudes and the  polar regions will be modeled using a general circulation model  (GCM) with which spatially and temporally varying snow albedo will  be employed.  Current means of snow albedo parameterization in  GCM's are based on temperature, latitude, and snow depth rather  than the physical properties of snow.  Validation of the GCM-  derived extent of snowcover and snow water equivalent will be  performed.  Physically-based parameterizations of snow albedo will  be developed for use in mathematical models of climate.  The  viability of using particular GCM's for large-scale snow hydrologic  estimates will be determined.  The feasibility of using physically-  based, time- and space-variant snow albedos in a GCM will also be  evaluated.  Remote sensing data will be investigated as a means of  assessing the accuracy of GCM snowcover estimates.  Current models  of climate are sensitive to snow albedo, yet they use simple,  inaccurate parameterization.  What is needed is a comprehensive  study of the relationship between snow albedo and hydrologic  response of climate models to sptial and temporal changes in snow  albedo.  GMC accuracy for seasonal snow extent and depth is still  untested.",
