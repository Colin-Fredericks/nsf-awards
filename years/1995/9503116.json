 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this Research Planning Grant is to perform  preliminary research and to develop a full proposal which  will be submitted to  NSF in the fall of 1995.  The primary  objective of the research is a  measurement and modeling  study of parallel computer systems.  The platforms to  be  used include the Kendall Square KSR1 and the Intel Paragon  multiprocessor  systems located at Oak Ridge National  Laboratory, and a network of Sun Solaris  2.3 workstations  located at Fisk University, an HBCU/MI.    The method of  evaluation is to measure and evaluate various  system design alternatives using  alternative queueing  network models of parallel computer systems.  Queueing  network models are chosen because, unlike other methods such  as Markov models  and Petri net models, queueing network  models do not require the enumeration of  all possible states  that the system may enter, but rather, use computationally  efficient techniques to determine mean performance metrics  of the system.  The use of parallel and distributed computer and  communications systems is  becoming commonplace.  However,  the computer systems which are the focus of  this research  have characteristics which are difficult to measure and  model.  The systems may have forking and joining in the task  graph, variations in the  multiprogramming level and use  various synchronization techniques.  System  issues such as  thread scheduling and placement are difficult to model  accurately.  Thus, the development and application of  computationally efficient  techniques for evaluating the  performance of these types of systems is an  important and  significant area of research.  The project includes a  component  for undergraduate research experiences at Fisk  University.  Given appropriate  guidance, undergraduate have  the opportunity to alter parameters, run  experiments, and  participate in the measuring and modeling process.",
