 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mechanical Engineering, at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, is the recipient of  funds from the National Science Foundation to renovate engineering laboratory space to meet research  needs of students and faculty in the areas of combustion engines and fuels, and lightweight materials.  Research activities involving combustion engines, alternative fuels, and emissions have allowed  talented minority high school students, undergraduates and graduate students to work independently or  with faculty members in the discipline.  Although research activities are performed, existing  laboratories lack proper environmental controls and safety mechanisms required to effectively operate  the facility throughout the year.  Due to the lack of air conditioning and humidity controls,  emissions  equipment and other diagnostic instrumentation are inoperable in the summer months. The  test cell gas detection system frequently malfunctions because of its age, thereby causing  interruptions during experiments.  Proper facilities for research in lightweight materials such as  plastics and composites are not available.  While scholarly activities in the discipline have been  expanding, the lack of space devoted to plastics and composites research has limited student  participation in experimental research and design in the field.  The renovation plan entails:  consolidating the existing foundry and metals processing laboratories to provide clean space for  plastics and composite research, providing climate and humidity controls for renovated labs, and  installing a new gas detection system to detect poisonous and flammable gases that build up in the  test cells.  The renovation of the engine test cells and the foundry area will increase research and  design productivity of faculty and students by increasing research training opportunities, sponsored  research activities in the department, and contributing to the needs of industry.",
