Because quasars  are  highly luminous, they can be observed to larger distances (and so  greater ages, when the Universe was much younger) than any  other  astronomical  object.  Since quasars  optically  look  just  like  stars,  the  main problem in finding them is how to  discriminate  them  from  stars.  The survey technique in this  study  involves  video  recording of low dispersion spectra, which in the case  of  large  redshift  (i.e. large distance) quasars will  exhibit  the  strong emission line Lyman-alpha. The survey is conducted like  a  census,  aiming for completeness to well defined limits. A  sharp  downturn in the number of quasars found in previous work beyond a  redshift  of  3  indicates that the initial period  of  birth  of  quasars,  and  probably  that  of  galaxies  as  well,  is  being  observed.  ***",
