The student audience includes  non-science and allied health majors, with women comprising 78% of  this population.  A three-pronged approach to laboratory  instruction is being employed: (1) Standard hands-on laboratories  of a conventional type, (2) Mixtures of hands-on laboratories and  interactive multimedia software, and (3) Computer-enhanced  laboratories.  Intelitool and A.D.A.M software is being employed  with IBM compatible computers.  Results of the project will be  reported at the Texas Junior College Teacher Association Convention  and to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board in Austin,  Texas.  Information will also be disseminated by the publication of  a scholarly paper.  Evaluation will primarily be based on data  collected on-line from statistically proven questionnaires  administered over the length of the project.",
