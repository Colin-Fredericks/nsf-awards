 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a critical need to improve the quality of science  instruction in elementary school classrooms. We address this need  by having College of Engineering faculty offer a course for  elementary education majors that focuses on current engineering  topics and, more importantly, to present material in such a way  that future teachers will be able to use the material in their  classrooms. This is accomplished by first introducing the  scientific principles of an engineering topic, then providing  instruction in an appropriate teaching method, and finally  completing the topic with a laboratory session that involves  projects that can be used in an elementary classroom.    The course is being developed by engineering and education  faculty in collaboration with elementary school teachers.  We  will offer each topic as a module to facilitate portability to  the elementary classroom and to allow offering the course for  either one, two, or three credit hours. We are targeting  pre-service elementary majors although the course is suitable for  in-service teachers and could be easily tailored to accommodate  middle-school participants.    We are collaborating with College of Education faculty to overlap  this course with their existing science teaching methods course.  We expect that participants will be more confident with science  topics and, using our material, will be able to teach science  more effectively. Dissemination of the developed materials will  occur via presentation at professional meetings within the state  and nationally. In addition, we are creating a textbook to  accompany the course. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the  course by interviewing participants and College of Education  faculty.",
