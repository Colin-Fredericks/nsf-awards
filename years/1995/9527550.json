 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    This award supports a project to use synthetic aperture radar  (SAR) data from the European  ERS-1 satellite for a structural analysis of the Antarctic  Peninsula.  This project constitutes a demonstration of the use  of SAR data for geological and geophysical investigations in  largely ice covered regions.    The Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the Antarctic Peninsula  involves a history of geometrically simple orthogonal plate  subduction, with successive collision of fracture zone-bounded  segments of the Antarctic-Aluk ridge crest from south to north  along the convergent margin.  It has been proposed that the  subducted fracture zones are reflected in geological and  structural segmentation of the Antarctic Peninsula and,  therefore, a direct mechanical interaction between the upper and  lower plates along the subducting margin is suggested.  Structural mapping from a synoptic ERS-1 SAR mosaic of the entire  Antarctic Peninsula should document the regional continuity of  any fracture zones into the continental crust and any systematic  changes in structure within the peninsula that may be linked  these fracture zones.  The goal is to systematically evaluate the  impact of subducting fracture zones on the upper plate along the  convergent margin.  The Antarctic Peninsula provides an unrivaled  opportunity for such a study because the ocean floor record is  well documented, Oground truthO exists from high-quality geologic  mapping and field structural data, and the convergent margin  represents the least complex scenario of fracture zone/trench  interaction.  The results of this study can provide a model for  other convergent margins worldwide where the tectonics are more  complicated.  Furthermore, this approach, using an ERS-1 SAR  mosaic, will serve as a prototype for SAR-based structural  mapping in ice-covered terrain that should prove useful when  RADARSAT data becomes available.",
