 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project examines algorithm design issues in the  areas of (1) Pattern Matching, (2) DNA Sequence Assembly,  (3) Data Structures,  and (4) Computation of n-body Potential  Fields.    The proposed problems in  pattern matching deal with efficient  methods for the construction of suffix  trees of strings and  trees, treatment of ambiguous symbols with the help of  suffix  trees, external memory algorithms for suffix trees, and several  issues  related to computation of convolutions of strings.  These  investigations are of  great significance to the broad areas of  Digital Libraries and Computational  Biology.    With the emergence of faster DNA sequencing methods, there is an  immediate need to develop better algorithms for assembling large  numbers of DNA  fragments.  Several problems that arise in such  sequence assembly are  investigated.    Recently, the PI developed an attractive procedure for  transforming data-structure-based algorithms which have good  amortized speed  into ones that have matching worst-case speed  characteristics.  Another goal of  this project is to explore the  applicability of this technique to problems  related to  persistence of data structures and dynamic maintenance of minimum  spanning trees.    In addition, the PI developed the concept of a well-separated  pair decomposition of points in d-dimensional space.  For a set P  of n-points,  this consists of a binary tree whose leaves are in  P, with internal nodes  corresponding to subsets of P in the  natural way, and a list of pairs of nodes,  such that the sets  corresponding to each node are geometrically separated by  appropriate distance, and each distinct pair of points is  `covered` by exactly  one of the pairs of the nodes.  The PI had  made use of this decomposition in  designing efficient algorithms  for n-body potential field computations and  several related  problems.  These techniques are extended to other problems.",
