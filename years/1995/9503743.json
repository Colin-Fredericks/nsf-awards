 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503743  Schwartz, Steven    The award will allow the purchase of a replacement for a  data acquisition and imaging system for a secondary ion mass  spectrometry/Auger electron spectroscopy (SINS/Auger)  instrument.  This new data system will provide three  dimensional imaging capability for the first time, so that  spatial maps of elemental concentrations at the parts per  million level can be produced.  The data system will  significantly enhance the machine sensitivity by storing  large volumes of data for post-analysis.  The new system  will replace outdated counting-electronics modules and will  incorporate specialized software for simultaneous SIMS/Auger  data acquisition.    The SIMS/Auger unit at Queens College is one of the most  prolific SIMS instruments employed for materials research.  Approximately 100 publications have utilized data from this  instrument since 1985.  These publications address a wide  range of materials issues, including segregation and  ordering in polymer blends, interdiffusion and metallic  contacts in compound semiconductor devices, characterization  of crystal growth, and fundamentals of ion-solid  interactions.  The machine is currently in round-the-clock  use, in support of several research contracts and projects,  and involving faculty from several universities, as well as  researchers in industry.",
