 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509056  Pellmyr    Ecological specialization is a powerful engine driving diversification and species formation among organisms.  For this reason, it is important to understand the pathways of specialization:  how often are new traits truly novel, and when do they arise through modification of preexisting traits?  Answers to this question have major bearing on our understanding the evolutionary plasticity of interactions.  This issue will be explored using highly specialized yuccas and yucca moths as a model system.  These species depend on each other for reproduction, with the moth being the sole pollinator of the plant and yucca seeds being the exclusive food of the moth's larvae.  A mechanism of selective abscission of young fruit allows the plant to balance the degree of seed destruction caused by the moth against pollination quality.  This project explores whether components of the abscission mechanisms are novel or modifications of preexisting traits.  First, experiments will be performed to test whether selective abscission based on pollination quality exits in more basal members of the yucca family.  Second, the physiological mechanism mediating abscission will be explored, using an experimental approach to test the effect of a chemical faator from eggs of yucca moths and their relatives on seed development.    The results from these experiments should provide a detailed understanding of the role of coevolution and preadaptations in ecological specialization.  The answers can have immediate implications for applied biology in, for example, how we manage new agricultural pests.",
