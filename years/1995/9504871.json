 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504871  Stasheff       The investigator's research is concerned with application of  techniques he developed earlier in his study of classifying spaces  and rational homotopy theory and combining those techniques with  developments introduced ad hoc by physicists.  Currently he is  particularly concerned with four classes of problems: (I) homotopy  associative differential graded algebras and Lie analogs,  particularly as they occur in string field theories and spin  n-algebras, (II) the homological aspects of reduction of  constrained Hamiltonian systems, both classical and quantum, as  embodied in the BRST formalism and the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky  complex and its generalizations, (III) the homological aspects of  Lagrangian and more general exterior differential systems, both  classical and quantum, as embodied in the anti-field formalism of  Batalin-Vilkovisky and its generalizations, (IV) the combinatorial  topology of compactifications of certain moduli spaces,  particularly as related to operads, knot theory and higher  categories.  All of these involve \"higher dimensional algebra\" for  which 1-dimensional diagrams are inadequate.  Although defined in  greater and more abstract generality, such structures as they occur  in or are inspired by mathematical physics are the focus of this  proposal.       Over the last decade or so, work in some areas of mathematical  physics, especially particle and string theory, has made increasing  use of cohomological techniques.  In some cases, physicists  independently rediscovered tools the investigator had invented or  developed in earlier research projects; more recently, planned  interaction and collaboration has led to physicists' being aware of  and hence making use of concepts he had invented, e.g., strong  homotopy Lie algebras.  Further development of these techniques  within the physical context has begun to have an effect on more  purely mathematical research, for example in exterior differential  systems.  Thus, as often happens, this in terdisciplinary activity  has proved to be a two-way street, and further mutual benefits are  anticipated.  ***",
