 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550017  Smith     This 42-month project develops a cadre of 40 math/science  teacher-leaders in K-12, trained on the use of Internet, who  serve as peer teacher trainers and members of an on-line  mentoring community.  They in turn train, support and mentor 1200  additional teachers from 400 schools in West Virginia.  All  participating schools are connected to the Internet and the  requisite equipment provided through cost sharing.  The  strategies include 2-weeks of teacher leader training, an  implementation year including Project Green and on-line learning,  and a follow-up three-day conference to debrief and prepare the  participants for peer teaching.  The peer groups are taught by  two teacher-leaders and one graduate student at various sites  throughout the state.  The project includes year-long mentorships  via the Internet, establishing  affinity groups, and developing a  science education gopher.      The science curriculum core for the project is drawn from Project  Green, is closely aligned with other state efforts and the  science frameworks, and is tied to the statewide concern about  water resources.  Graduate credit is awarded through West  Virginia University and Marshall University and ranges from 4 to  7 graduate credits per participant.  In addition to developing  the expert base and a large community of users, the project  investigates the effectiveness of the activity.      Cost sharing is 218%.  ***",
