 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    This award supports a project to lay the groundwork for  development of a reliable magnetostratigraphic record from drill  core collected by the international Cape Roberts Project (CRP).  A reliable chronostratigraphic framework is a prerequisite for  proper interpretation of the climatic and tectonic events that  are the focus of the CRP.  Magnetostratigraphy could play a major  role in development of that framework, but previous paleomagnetic  studies of sedimentary sequences from Antarctica have shown that  extracting a reliable magnetostratigraphy from the CRP cores may  not be easy and that sophisticated treatment of samples may be  necessary.  This project will undertake paleomagnetic and mineral  magnetic investigations of the lower part (Eocene and/or  Oligocene) of the CIROS-1 core, which was collected in 1984/85  from western McMurdo Sound.  In addition to useful information  bearing on paleoenvironments that can be extracted from this  core, this work provides an opportunity to gain paleomagnetic  experience with the lithologies present in the Cape Roberts  region and to address problems encountered in previous attempts  to recover paleomagnetic records.  This project will also utilize  Cretaceous to Paleocene drill cuttings from the Great South Basin  near New Zealand.  The results of this work will allow  determination of the most appropriate strategy for dealing with  samples during the drilling and basic characterization phase of  the CRP, when time and resources will be very limited.  In this  way, the efficiency of on site paleomagnetic investigations in  support of the basic characterization work on the core should be  greatly enhanced.",
