 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422761    A longstanding issue in business cycle analysis is understanding  how small shocks may produce large fluctuations in output.   Recent theoretical research has shown how financial propagation  mechanisms could amplify swings in spending and production caused  by technology shocks or shifts in monetary.  The theory begins  with the idea, that for a significant class of borrowers  (households, small and medium sized firms, etc.), information and  enforcement problems may drive the cost of uncollateralized funds  above the price of internal funds.  Under these circumstances,  borrowers' available supplies of collateral (broadly defined) and  internal funds influence the terms of credit they face.  In this  way, borrowers' financial positions ultimately influence their  spending and production decisions.  The theory predicts that  differences in cyclical behavior should emerge across classes of  borrowers, depending on their respective access to credit,  everything else equal.  Credit market frictions are also more  likely to impinge on behavior around recessionary periods, when  borrowers have relatively weak balance sheets.  To identify  financial propagation effects, therefore, it is important to look  at data across different phases of the business cycle, as well as  across different classes of borrowers.  This project will  empirically assess financial propagation mechanisms using a newly  available Census Bureau panel data for firms that contain both a  rich cross-sectional dimension and a long time series dimension  at the business cycle frequency to empirically assess financial  propagation mechanisms.  Unlike previously used firm level data  sets, this data covers non-publicly as well as publicly traded  firms for both manufacturing and other sectors, and has a long  time series available at the quarterly frequency.      More specifically, this project contributes to our understanding  of financial propagation mechanisms in four ways:  The first is a  comprehensive descriptive ana lysis of the data for the  manufacturing sector.  The second involves structural estimation  of inventory and investment demand equations to identify the  influence of liquidity constraints in this sector.  The third  links the firm level data to Census Bureau plant level data to  study the effects of financial factors on labor demand in  manufacturing.  The final project extends these efforts to the  retail and wholesale trade sectors.",
