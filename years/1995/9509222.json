 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509222  Middleton  The primary structure of a family of proteins has been identified  as components of the rat colon epithelial sodium channel.  The  coexpression of three homologous subunits, a, B, and g, in Xenopus  laevis oocytes results in the expression of a sodium current that  is like that described in the sodium transporting epithelia.   Partial clones of each subunit from Xenopus kidney mRNA have been  obtained.  The objectives of this research are (1) to determine if  the three clones encode renal sodium channels, and (2) to determine  if the clones are sufficient to produce sodium channel activity,  and whether all three are necessary for proper channel activity.   Specifically, antisense oligonucleotides will be used to suppress  sodium channel expression in A6 cells, a cell line derived from  Xenopus kidney.  Subunit specific antisense oligonucleotides have  been generated from the sequences of the partial clones.  The  effectiveness of the oligonucleotides at suppressing protein  expression will be assessed by looking at target mRNA and protein  levels with Northern and Western analysis, respectively.  Protein  levels will be ascertained by Western analysis, and the suppression  of sodium channel activity will be determined  electrophysiologically.  %%%  The importance of epithelial sodium transport in maintaining proper  organismic sodium levels is very clear.  Understanding the  structural correlates of function of the epithelial sodium channel  will lead to a better understanding of sodium transport and its  regulation.  This research will determine whether a family of  proteins encoded by three Xenopus clones represents the sodium  channel responsible for regulated sodium transport in the distal  nephron.  It will be a first step in the investigation of  structure-function relationships of the epithelial sodium channel.  ***",
