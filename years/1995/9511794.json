 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theories of relativistic dissipative fluids will be applied  to study situations of astrophysical and experimental  interest.  Constraints relating the properties of fluid  stability, causality, and hyperbolicity in these theories  can be used to strengthen existing upper limits on the mass  of neutron stars.  The behavior of the theories when applied  to a Fermi gas far from equilibrium will be studied; whether  nonlinear effects destroy hyperbolicity in this case will be  determined.  These results will then be used to apply the  fluid models to the study of relativistic fluid collisions,  ranging from heavy ions to neutron stars.  Present theories  of relativistic dissipative superfluids have been shown to  be physically unacceptable, as all equilibrium states within  those theories are unstable.  A newly proposed theory which  seems (on the surface) to avoid this problem will be  analyzed in detail, and its fundamental properties regarding  stability, causality, and hyperbolicity analyzed.    Extreme black holes, possessing degenerate event horizons  and zero surface gravity, are currently playing a central  role in work on black hole thermodynamics and the  \"information loss\" puzzle of black hole evaporation.  Using  the methods developed by Anderson, Hiscock, and Samuel, the  quantum effects of vacuum polarization on an extreme black  hole's geometry and thermodynamics will be studied.",
