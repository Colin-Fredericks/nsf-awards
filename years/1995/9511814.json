 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511814  Kuo    The  goal of this research project is to understand how the human  brain  puts  together  thousands of pieces  of  information  from  sensors  throughout the body, such as eyes, the  inner  ear,  and  receptors  in joints and muscles, to form a picture of where  the  limbs  are and how they are moving. This information is used  for  planning and control of movement. It is a process that the  brain  carries out subconsciously; it is critically important for proper  balance,  to keep up from falling; it provides athletes with  the  ability  to  move  fluidly and skillfully and allows  seamen  and  astronauts  to  adjust movements to their new  environments.  The  approach  used in this study is to integrate techniques from  two  scientific fields. Physiological studies describe how signals are  produced by the sensors and define the places in the brain  where  these signals are transmitted. Control engineering describes  how  signals  of many types can be used to perform a useful  task.  In  this  project,  physiologists  and control  engineers  will  work  together  to  examine  the  differences  in  balance  control  in  astronauts  before  and after spaceflight. The  adaptations  that  take  place during spaceflight make it possible to determine some  of the factors that are and are not relevant to control of moment  and,   therefore,  to  explain  some  of  the  basic   mechanisms  underlying control of movement.",
