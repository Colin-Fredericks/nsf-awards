In earlier work, it was demonstrated  that Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy can  provide detailed information about the protonation state, local  environment and orientation of specific amino acid residues which  are structurally active during the bR photocycle.  However, a key  problem limiting future progress is the assignment of FTIR bands to  individual groups in a protein.  While site-directed mutagenesis  (SDM) has been successfully applied in special cases for this  purpose, its use is limited due to perturbations induced in the  structure and function of the protein as illustrated by recent  studies on the mutant Y185F. In addition, SDM does not permit the  assignment of bands to the vibrations of specific peptide groups,  an essential next step for investigating protein backbone  conformational changes such as have been detected between the M and  N intermediates of bR.  A general method of band assignment has now been developed based on  site-directed isotope labeling (SDIL).  SDIL analogs of bR are  produced by cell-free synthesis using specially aminoacylated  suppressor tRNAs.  These SDIL-bR analogs have identical properties  as native bR and are suitable for FTIR-difference spectroscopy.  In  the first application of this approach, bands have been assigned to  the vibrations of specific tyrosine side-chains as well as to  individual groups in the bR backbone structure.  In this research,  SDIL-FTIR will be used to investigate systematically the role of  specific residues in bR proton pumping .  Our experiments will be  guided by earlier studies which have provided information about  specific residues which undergo protonation changes, may  participate in a hypothesized proton wire, act to couple the  retinal chromophore to the protein and are involved in secondary  structural changes of the protei n.  Recently developed methods for  time-resolved FTIR-difference spectroscopy, polarized FTIR and  attenuated total reflection FTIR will also be used in this  research.  In collaboration with the J. Spudich laboratory, the  SDIL-FTIR approach will be extended to sensory-rhodopsin I (sRI),  a phototaxis light-receptor in Halobacteria salinarium.  %%%  The primary goal of this project is understanding how  bacteriorhodopsin functions as a light-driven proton pump.   Bacteriorhodopsin serves as a prototype for other membrane proteins  which carry out essential process in cells including ion transport  and energy transduction.  A promising new approach for studying how  membrane proteins function is FTIR-difference spectroscopy.  When  combined with biochemical and genetic methods it has the power to  provide information about the protonation state, local environment  and even orientation of specific groups in a protein.  Unlike  solid-state NMR, infrared spectroscopy can also probe rapid dynamic  conformational changes in proteins.  In this project, FTIR-  difference spectroscopy will be combined with three methods: i)  uniform isotope labeling of specific amino acids; ii) site-directed  mutagenesis (SDM) and site-directed isotope labeling (SDIL) to  investigate bacteriorhodopsin.  If successful, these studies will  provide a detailed picture of how bacteriorhodopsin functions and  provide clues to how other membrane proteins work.   ***",
