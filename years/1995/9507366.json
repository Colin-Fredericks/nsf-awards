The research focuses on the physics of  bilayer membranes.  Such membranes are of great interest  because they model the real biomembranes surrounding cells  and their constituent organelles.  They also have a host of  technological applications to microencapsulation, drug  delivery, biosensors, and as the foundation for novel  materials with desirable optoelectronic, transport and  biocompatibility properties.    While the equilibrium conformations of artificial, one-  component membranes are well studied and developed, the  dynamics of membranes is less well developed.  The following  topics will be studied on the current grant: shapes of  monolayer domains; response of artificial membranes to  perturbation, and in particular newly emerging laser tweezer  technology for creating fast, precise, delicate  disturbances; dynamics of more realistic membranes  containing active pumps, budding proteins, and other  simplified machines; and, the formation of patterns both  within one membrane and in aggregates of active membranes,  in particular in aggregates of biological cells.  %%%  This is a theoretical research grant jointly funded by the  Divisions of Materials Research, Physics and Molecular and  Cellular Biology.
