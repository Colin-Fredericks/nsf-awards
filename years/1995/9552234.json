The College currently faces the challenge of  continuing to fulfill this mission by incorporating appropriate  technology into education and training programs for a student body  that has become increasingly diverse.  This challenge is perhaps  greatest in the sciences.  Through the project proposed in this  request to NSF, Valencia will target six courses in the physical  sciences by infusing computer-assisted learning experiences and  data image processing into the curricula.           In planning this project, faculty examined several  possibilities for incorporating the use of computers into the  laboratory setting for the following courses: Earth Sciences,  Physical Geology, Historical Geology, Meteorology, Astronomy, and  Oceanography.  The decision was made to carry out a project based  on the successful curricula developed by the Center for Image  Processing in Education in association with the University of  Arizona.  Image processing provides a powerful medium to excite  students about science, especially students from minority groups  and others whose needs have not been met by traditional ways of  teaching these subjects.  Using professional-quality software on  microcomputers, students will explore a variety of scientific data  sets, including earth remote sensing and meteorology data and  planetary exploration im ages.           While these courses will develop inquiry and research skills  for all students, the project will also encourage more students to  pursue professional science careers and provide them with the  appropriate training in subject matter and the use of up-to-date  technology for the respective fields.  Valencia requests the NSF's  support for the purchase of microcomputers, software, and databases  to incorporate new curricula and pedagogy into the targeted  courses.",
