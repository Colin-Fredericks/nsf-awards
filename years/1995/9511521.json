 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511521  Smeeding    The Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) database consists of comparable  microdata on the composition of households and the structure of  their cash incomes for 23 industrialized economies as of December  1994.  LIS standardizes these data and makes them available  through electronic mail.  These data are used by over 300  researchers worldwide to analyze economic and social policy and  its effect on such topics as income structure, poverty and income  inequality, and wage and earnings differentials by education  level and by gender.  Regular activities such as biennial  meetings and summer workshops, are combined with intermittent  conferences and meetings involving the database.  Over the past  seven years, the LIS project has demonstrated its feasibility and  usefulness as an internationally sponsored and researcher-lead  database project.  It is unique in its approach to funding in  that the majority of its support, and all of its \"core'  operations, are funded by a consortium of 18 nations.  Because  electronic access to LIS is, by design and intent, free once a  privacy pledge is signed, many users treat it as a \"public good\"  which provides benefits at little or no direct cost to them.   This grant provides renewed funding for the United States core  contribution to LIS.",
