State University of New York at Albany  Title: Development of a Sampling Strategy for the Verification of          Global Transport Models Using Airborne Radon Measurement    Although the verification of global transport models using airborne  radon measurementq has received attention at two major workshops,  the observations available thus far for intercomparsion with model  predictions are fragmentary and were not always obtained using a  sampling strategy designed with such intercomparsions in mind.  In  this project we will work closely with two prominent global  modeling groups on the development of such a strategy, with  emphasis on designing a measurement program which will permit the  evaluation of competing computational schemes for parameterizing  vertical convective transport in 3-D models.    In this effort the global circulation and assimilation wind models  under development at the Global Climate Dynamics Program at NCAR  and at the Data Assimilation Office at the NASA Goddard Space  Flight Center will be used to stimulate free tropospheric radon  distributions over North America using a variety of convective  parameterizations.  Working with researchers in these  organizations, the PI will examine these distributions and simulate  the radon concentrations which would be encountered and sampled by  instrumentation on an aircraft following various flight paths  through such distributions in order to develop flight plans and  sampling strategies which would allow an efficient evaluation of  model performance.  In this effort the PI will also use the radon  vertical profiles acquired by his group in the summer of 1994. (The  1994 data set will also be made available to the modeling community  on the internet.)    This research is important because it attempts to develop an  observational basis for testing and improving the way GCMs  simulation vertical transports.",
