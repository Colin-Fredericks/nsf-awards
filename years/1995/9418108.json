 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418108  Peacor    Propose to continue to study processes of transformation in fine-grained pelitic rocks and other rocks dominated by clay minerals over the range of diagenesis through low-grade metamorphism.  The textural, chemical, and structural characteristics of mineral assemblages are being investigated with emphasis on transmission and analytical electron microscopy but utilizing a full range of techniques including SEM and XRD, and in a context involving collaboration with specialists in rock deformation, metamorphic petrology, stable and radiogenic isotope analysis and low-temperature geochemistry.  Samples are selected from continuous sequences chosen to represent critical features and which have been well-characterized by a wide range of field and laboratory studies.  Comparison of observations within and between a variety of prograde sequences permits processes of mineral transformations, deformation, and crystal growth to be defined, especially insofar as solids record evidence of crystal/fluid interactions.   Specific topics include:  (1) Nature of smectite, I/S, and illite:  Stacking relations (2) Mechanisms for the transformation of smectite of illite.  (3) Variations in reaction mechanisms as a function of rock type.  (4) Mechanisms of crystal growth in both burial diagenetic and low-grade metamorphic regimes (5) Quantitative relation between structure and texture as related to cause of changes in illite and chlorite crystallinity.  (6) Origins of interlayer cation composition of smectite.  These and other topics will be studied using sequences of samples from prograde pelitic sequences in the following localities:  Texas Gulf Coast, Southern Uplands of Scotland, Welsh sedimentary basin, South Island of New Zealand, Nankai Trench, Franciscan Formation of California, Iberian Massif of Spain, and the Ketama Unit of the Rift Chain of Morocco.  All sequences are from well-characterized sequences that permit characterization of processes over a range of types of pelites and over the  full range of diagenesis and low-grade metamorphism, leading to documentation of trends and processes.   Focusing especially on the roles of fluids and stress, as the collective data appear to show that all processes are consistent with Ostwald step-like transitions from metastable states toward stable equilibrium, as mediated by fluids, and increasingly by deformation induced by tectonic stress with increasing grade, with subsequent implications for the use of clay minerals as indicators of reaction progress rather than as accurate geothermometers.  ??",
