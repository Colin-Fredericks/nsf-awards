This  proposal is to conduct a study to understand the embrittlement   of copper-bismuth alloys. It requests funds to support a half-  time graduate student to work on this project and to support the  P.I.'s  travels to Taiwan.  This project enables Dr. King to gain  access to equipment that is not yet available in the United  States, while he can provide expertise to his collaborator in the  areas of specimen preparation and interfacial structure analysis.   The embrittlement of metals is an important problem in materials  science and currently poses significant limitations in material  applications.  This is an excellent project, which addresses an  important problem with promise for useful results and provides a  hands-on opportunity for training a U.S. graduate student.  This  project is jointly supported by the NSF and the Taiwan National  Science Council (NSC),  which provides major support for  laboratory operations.  The modest support from the NSF in this  case is extensively leveraged by the NSC.",
