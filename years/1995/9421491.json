 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421491  Brooks  This is an award to support research, the objective of which is  to obtain an understanding of the fundamental physical and  chemical processes that control the interchange of substances in  alluvial sediments of flowing water streams with the water as  affected by the sediment bed forms such as ripples and dunes.   The basic approach being taken in this research is the conduct of   experiments in recirculating laboratory flumes under very  carefully controlled conditions of flow, water quality, the bed  media and the nature of the substances dissolved or in  particulate form being exchanged at the bed-fluid interface.      This is a renewal of research previously conducted under NSF  Grant No. 91-05965.  Results of this research may be applied to   answering important questions relating to the pollutional effects  that substances in bottom sediments of water bodies have on the  overlying water quality.  This knowledge is likely to be applied  in environmental engineering practice to determine approaches to  removal of potential water pollutants and contaminants from  sediments and in determining locations for wastewater treatment  plants that would minimize the undesirable effects on  environmental quality of their effluent discharges and management  practices for residual sludges.    ***",
