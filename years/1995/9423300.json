 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423300  May       This project encompasses research in a wide variety of topics  in topology and related areas of algebra, algebraic K-theory and  algebraic geometry.  One focus is global algebraic structures in  stable homotopy theory, with applications to such topics as  cobordism, topological Hochschild homology, and algebraic K-theory.  Another is the study of algebraic and topological vector bundles  and of Hochschild homology for algebraic varieties.  Another is the  study of analytic and combinatorial torsion invariants of  manifolds.       Research in algebraic and geometric topology at the University  of Chicago has for many years explored areas both internal to  topology and areas on the borders between topology and algebraic  geometry and differential geometry.  Ideas developed here, for  example the notion of an operad, have been used in diverse fields,  from mathematical physics to combinatorial group theory.  Graduate  students and postdocs involved in the project leave Chicago with  especially broad interdisciplinary training and background.  ***",
