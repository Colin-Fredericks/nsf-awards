 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512161  Costello   The award provides funds for the acquisition of a shrink small outline integrated circuit (SSOIC) board production facility at Cooper Union.  This facility will allow research and education surface mount transistors or surface mount technologies.  These technologies enable the fabrication of integrated circuits that are about one-fourth of the size of previous dual-in-line integrated circuits.  Dual-in-line circuits can be placed in sockets and hand wire-wrapped into an electronic circuit.  Surface mount devices are too small to be hand wired.  Instead, they must be soldered onto a multi-layer circuit board with lead spacing as small as 0.5 mm.  This equipment will support research in blood velocity sensing, phase analysis of EKGs, smart telephone control systems, and advanced communication devices including a digital-signal-processor-based voice identification/verification system.     This facility will enable Cooper Union's electrical engineering faculty and student to remain in the forefront of current technology and better contribute to the nation's technological infrastructure and global competitiveness.  ***",
