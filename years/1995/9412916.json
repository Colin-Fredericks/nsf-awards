We propose an international collaboration to  combine experimental and theoretical efforts in the study of  the hot plasma channels produced by fast capillary  discharges for the development of efficient sources of both  coherent and incoherent soft x-ray radiation.  The proposed research is motivated by results of  recent  experiments conducted at Colorado State University, that  confirm that very fast excitation of capillary channels with  current risetimes of approximately 10ns can generate dense  plasma columns of small diameter with electron temperatures  of a few hundred eV utilizing currents that are more than an  order of magnitude smaller than those employed to obtain hot  plasmas in Terawatt pulse power machines.  Results include  the observation of emission from the 3p-3s laser candidate  transitions of neon-like calcium in 1.5 -2.5mm diameter  capillaries at currents as low as 40kA.  Such capability for  efficiently generating plasma columns of small (200um)  diameter by direct discharge excitation could provide a new  route towards compact and efficient soft x-ray lasers. Also,  the direct transfer of electrically stored energy into  reproducible hot capillary plasmas of small diameter and  could result in a cost efficient incoherent x-ray source.  The proposed cooperative research will combine capillary  discharge experiments conducted at Colorado State University  with a detailed theoretical analysis of the radiative  properties of capillary discharge  plasmas, which will be  based on elaborate magnetohydrodynamic and radiation  transport codes developed at the Lebedev Physics Institute.  The comparison of spatially and time resolved soft x-ray  spectra from capillary plasmas operating in a new fast  discharge regime with state of the art MHD/atomic physics  calculations is expected to provide an increased  understanding of these plasmas and  the necessary guidance  for their development into efficient practical sources of  coherent and incoherent soft x-ray radiation.",
