An understanding of these processes is gained by directly studying  the molecular contacts defining the protein-nucleotide interface,  using UV resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy.  This spectroscopic  technique investigates the sequence specificity of the protein-DNA  interaction by monitoring the H-bond pairings of nucleotide  exocyclic amino and carbonyl groups.  Additionally, the Raman  effect is enhanced by tuning into an absorption band; therefore,  different regions of the binary complex can be probed by varying  the excitation wavelength. Thus, in addition to identifying the  contacts which confer specificity to the binding site, UVRR  spectroscopy also monitors conformational changes in both the  protein and DNA.  Investigations are conducted on two proteins, HU and Integration  Host Factor(IHF), both members of a class of prokaryotic histone-  like proteins. These proteins facilitate the binding and action of  regulatory proteins by binding to the minor groove and bending the  DNA.  The majority of previously characterized protein-nucleic acid  interactions have typically involved direct contact between the  protein  -helix and the major groove.  In HU and IHF, binding and  recognition occurs between  -strands and the minor groove,  representative of a different class of interaction.  To date very  few crystal structures exist for this type of protein-DNA  interaction and this research provides a mechanism for identifying  the factors which confer specificity and stability to the  nucleosome complex.      %%%  Understanding the growth and development of cells centers on an  understanding of the factors that regulate growth.  At the most  basic level this involves knowing how genes work and the factors  that cause them to \"turn on or turn off.\"  In this research the  mec hanism of regulation is studied by examining the interface  between genetic regulatory proteins and the gene or the DNA.  These  proteins bind to the gene and either promote or repress its  function.  To understand how these proteins function, it is  important to know in detail how they interact with DNA.  A laser  spectroscopic technique, UV resonance Raman spectroscopy, is used  to investigate the interface between the proteins and the DNA.   This method monitors the internal vibrations of molecules, which  are a sensitive measure of the structure and bonding of a molecule.   Using this technique, different parts of the protein or the DNA can  be selectively examined, thereby allowing direct investigation of  the important regions and contact points.  These experiments probe  the complex formed between regulatory proteins and genes and  contribute towards understanding how genetic function is regulated  in the cell.    ***",
