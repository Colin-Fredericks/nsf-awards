 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554501  Stanford  A pilot project to initiate multidisciplinary research needed to  determine links and conflicts between long-term economic growth and  sustainability of ecosystem integrity is proposed. The vehicle to  accomplish this end is an experimental collaboration of some 80  scientists called the Consortium for Study of North Temperate  Montane Ecosystems. The group is composed of scholars at The  University of Montana, Montana State University and participating  institutions. The Consortium will be advised by members of relevant  land management agencies and informed citizens. Existing and  new basic research efforts will coalesce under the Consortium  umbrella around a common, integrativeresearch theme.  Examination  of biodiversity patterns and processes, including natural, social  and economic attributes in a regional ecosystem context, is the  unifying principle.    Work will be focused on the Crown of the Continent (CCE) and  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystems (GYE). The GYE and CCE represent the  largest, relatively intact ecosystems in temperate latitudes of  the world. They are among the last vestiges of \"natural\" Montana  ecosystems and encompass mountains and river valleys where  altitudinal, climatic and associated gradients lead to a diverse  assemblage of animals, plants and human communities. Both  ecosystems are rapidly becoming affected by human influences at  local to regional scales as a consequence of shifting demographic  and economic patterns. The biodiversity unifier will be used to  guide assembly, analysis and modeling of massive regional data  bases required to accomplish an integrated synthesis that, in the  long run, will offer predictions about future conditions as a  consequence of current practices and policies. The primary goal of  the Consortium is to sufficiently understand linkages and conflicts  between natural and social components to begin to predict the long-  and short-term consequences of environmental and social change  within and between these two  enormously valuable ecosystems.",
