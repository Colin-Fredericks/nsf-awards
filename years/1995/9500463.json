The goals of the program are:  (1) To understand the mathematics of quantization of systems (involving   both finitely and infinitely many degrees of freedom) with complicated   geometry of phase space;  (2) To study the non-commutative geometric principles underlying  the physics of the microworld, and in particular possible implications   for quantum gravity;  (3) To explore new mathematical phenomena relating analysis to other   fields of mathematics.         Non-commutative geometry is a new direction of mathematics   created in the eighties. Its prime objective is to study objects,   called non-commutative spaces or manifolds, which are not ordinary   geometric objects but still have a geometric flavor. Examples of   structures of this sort arise naturally e.g. in physical theories   of subatomic phenomena. Methods of non-commutative geometry became   a powerful tool in studying various problems in modern analysis   and understanding the fundamentals of the physics of the   microworld. It is proposed to study examples of non-commutative   manifolds with emphasis put on applications to quantum physics.   Also, it is proposed to relate some of the ideas of quantum theory   to problems in number theory and modern analysis.  ***",
