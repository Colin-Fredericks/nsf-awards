 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507173  Delidow    Regulation of pituitary prolactin (PRL) gene expression involves  the actions of a number of neurotransmitters, hormones, growth  factors and other soluble signaling molecules. In addition it has  been shown that changes in extracellular matrix components can  regulate PRL gene expression, and that agents which regulate PRL  can also induce changes in cell adhesiveness. Preliminary data has  shown that PRL gene expression in the rat pituitary tumor 235-1  cells is induces under culture conditions in which large cell  aggregates form, and that high PRL mRNA levels are dependent upon  the presence of these aggregates. To persue these observations, the  proposed research will attempt to: 1. Determine by cell culture  studies whether induction of PRL gene expression requires contact  with aggregates, or whether a soluble factor(s) is produced by  aggregates and acts independently of cell contact. If the signal  appears to be a soluble factor, aggregate-conditioned media will be  assayed for the ability to induce PRL mRNA. 2. Determine by  agonist/inhibitor studies whether the signal is transduced via  cellular kinase pathways.  Actin and tubulin staining will be used  to examine changes in cytoskeletal organization. The presence of  beta1-integrins, cadherins and neural cell adhesion molecules will  also be determined. 3. Determine whether the increase in PRL mRNA  occurs at the transcriptional level. These studies will provide a  base of information for future studies on contact regulation of PRL  gene expression.  ***",
