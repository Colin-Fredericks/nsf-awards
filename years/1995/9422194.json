 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422194  This project advances our understanding of industrial  organization in three areas: financial markets and financial  intermediation, the timing of investment decisions, and general  equilibrium with incomplete information.  The first part of the  project studies the striking differences between the financial  systems of different countries.  In the U.S., for example,  financial markets are highly developed; in other countries such  as Germany, intermediaries play a much larger role.  These cross-  country differences raise questions about the optimality of  different financial systems and the costs and benefits of  convergence.  The object of this study is to compare the relative  performance of financial markets and intermediaries in providing  risk sharing, information, and allocative services.  The work  involves developing models of intermediation and comparing their  welfare properties with those of financial markets.    The second part of the project studies the timing of business  investment decisions.  When making investment decisions, firms  often have an incentive to delay in order to gather information  about what other firms are going to do.  This leads to strategic  behavior, since every firm prefers to make its commitment after  others have made theirs.  This project shows how endogenous delay  in business investment decisions can prolong recessions and  increase the amplitude of fluctuations in economic activity, and  produce cycles in the introduction of new technology.    An important function of the market system is to economize on the  amount of information required to achieve an efficient allocation  of resources.  However, markets may not function well when some  agents are able to exploit private information.  The third part  of the project builds on and extends earlier work which modeled  equilibrium in market systems with private information.  Two  applications, one concerning financial regulation and one  concerning securitization of contracts, motivate the deve lopment  and analysis of a richer class of models to investigate how well  the market system copes with private information in these  environments.",
