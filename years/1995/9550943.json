These resources range from programs and class notes to  data sets for statistics and discussions of timely topics vital to  the mathematical community.  Many persons who would benefit from  these resources are unable to do so because of a lack of knowledge  of what is available and a lack of understanding of how to access  items on the Internet.  Based on experience with the Internet in  establishing and running the Mathematics Archives, this project is  informing the mathematical community about available resources on  the Internet and educating them on how to access those resources.   This will be accomplished with an ambitious program consisting of  presentations at sectional meetings of the MAA and running special  sessions, workshops, and minicourses at national and regional  meetings, such as those of the MAA/AMS, AMATYC, and ICTCM.  The  impact of this program on the mathematical community is expected to  be substantial.",
