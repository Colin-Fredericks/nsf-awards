 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrated assessment is increasingly used as a way to bridge the gap between   science and policy in environmental problems. Models of each aspect of a complex   problem are often too cumbersome to integrate directly. Instead, it is often more appealing   to develop reduced-form models for each component model that are small enough to be   comprehensible, flexible, and easily linked to one another. A reduced-form model provides   approximately the same behavior as the model from which it is extracted in a much more   compact and comprehensible form. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate   techniques to help modellers analyze their models and construct reduce-form models.   The specific objectives are:  1. To design and prototype a modellers' workbench to facilitate specification and   documentation of the inputs, outputs, and assumptions of existing models of   various types and sizes;  2. To provide a range of existing and new sampling techniques to generate   scenarios to exercise these models;  3. To provide a range of existing and new model analysis techniques to identify   key inputs and parameters, identify nonmonotonic and regions of qualitatively   different behavior, and so help develop reduced-form models; and  4. To evaluate these techniques experimentally by application to the development   of reduced-form models and integrated assessment models, and so to provide   guidance on which techniques are most valuable and for what kinds of models.  This project is supported under the Methods and Models for Integrated Assessment   funding opportunity.",
