Deterioration caused by environmental  factors has added to the problem.  According to the FHWA, 40% of  the nation's bridges are classified as deficient and in need of  rehabilitation or replacement.  In lieu of replacement in  numerous instances strengthening has been determined to be a cost-  effective alternative. Many researchers institutes, university,  and consulting offices have developed various efficient bridge  rehabilitation and strengthening procedures.  To provide a forum  for disseminating \"tried and true\" rehabilitation and  strengthening procedures practicing bridge engineers, an NSF-  sponsored symposium was held in Des Moines, Iowa in April 1993.    There is need for a second bridge strengthening/rehabilitation  symposium in that there are still major bridge problems and a  considerable amount of design and research has been completed  within the last two years.  Therefore, a second symposium, open  to all interested engineers, will be followed by a workshop of  invited participants to formulate a manual on bridge  strengthening and rehabilitation based on the presentations at  both symposiums.  The final manual will be prepared by the  symposium steering committee and made available to designers in  both public and private practice.  ***",
