Analytical models of rotors and their nonlinear  supports and coupling components are developed. Local  nonlinearities in rotor systems are manifested in dampers,  clearances and fluid interactions. Linearized analysis of  industrial rotating machinery does not capture its full  dynamics, and designs based upon such analyses may lead to  severe malfunctions or catastrophic failures. In this  project analytical/computational methods are developed for  determining the nonlinear dynamic behavior of systems,  including their periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic  response and bifurcation. These include the harmonic balance  method, fixed point method, and their combinations. The  results of this research advance the state of knowledge of  nonlinear rotordynamics and leads to the development of  reliable design techniques to mitigate the effects of  nonlinear dynamics and chaos.***",
