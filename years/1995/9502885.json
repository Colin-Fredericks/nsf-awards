 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component of this faculty early career development  proposal is aimed at developing a large, important, and  fundamentally new class of multirate filter banks, systems and  wavelets.  Traditional developments of this topic within the signal  processing community have been strongly motivated by applications  involving signal analysis.  In strong contrast, the research in  this proposal is motivated by some important contemporary  applications involving signal synthesis.  In particular, multirate  filterbank theory, wavelet theory have a potentially important and  largely unexplored role to play in the synthesis of waveforms for  a wide variety of broadband communications and remove sensing  applications.    In these applications, fundamentally different types of design  criteria and constraints come into play in developing suitable  multirate structures.  Foremost among the important differences is  that while for most applications involving signal analysis strong  localization in time and frequency is emphasized, the kinds of  applications that will be the focus of this work will require  filterbanks and wavelets whose energy is widely dispersed in both  time and frequency.  We propose to explore several classes of  orthogonal and biorthogonal dispersive, \"pseudorandom\" filterbanks  and wavelet bases.    Several specific application areas are to be pursued under the  proposed research.  One that will be emphasized will be digital  wireless communications.  Here dispersive filterbanks and wavelets  are expected to lead to new code-division multiplexing systems that  more efficiently combat fading, jamming, and other forms of  multiple-access interference.  Furthermore, we plan to implement  the new wireless modems we develop in a DSP-based, real-time 900 Mz  indoor wireless system testbed recently developed by the principal  investigator as part of his wireless communications laboratory.    The educational component of the proposal encompasses significant  curriculum development at b oth the undergraduate and graduate  levels, and a strong investment in the mentoring of graduate  students.  One teaching initiative involves the development of a  recently introduced unified new undergraduate subject.  This  subject introduces undergraduate students, for the first time, to  the fundamentals of communications, control and signal processing  from a common perspective and which builds on a foundation of basic  signals, systems, and probability.    The second major teaching initiative involves the re-engineering of  the fundamental graduate subject on stochastic processes, detection  and estimation at MIT.  In this subject, the object is to redevelop  a syllabus, course notes, Matlab computer exercises, and homework  problems that emphasize modern, unified perspective to random and  deterministic signals and the associated signal processing  algorithms.  These curricular changes will also allow a number of  advanced topics, including multiscale and nonlinear signal  processing, to be incorporated.    A final component of the education plan involves continued active  mentoring of a diverse group of graduate students and nurturing  their intellectual, professional, and personal growth.  Ultimately,  of course, this interaction is one of the most gratifying and  important aspects of a academic career.",
