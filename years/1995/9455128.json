 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two groups of eighteen college astronomy faculty will come to the  Center for Astrophics (CfA) in June 1995.  Each group will  participate in a week-long workshop that will include daily  lectures and training sessions and nighttime observing.  While at  the Center, faculty will be taught the rudiments of CCD (charged  coupled device) operation, techniques of image reduction and  photometric measurement, image processing techniques and data  reduction.  In addition to CCD photometry, photoelectric photometry  will also be covered for observing occultations, and for people who  wish to use photoelectric photometers.  The participants will be  given information on hardware and software available for small  telescopes, and will get experience in using that equipment at the  telescopes at the CfA's Oak Ridge Observatory.  They will interact  with faculty who have conducted successful research programs at  other small colleges, and with scientists who have programs that  utilize data taken with small telescopes.  They will learn about  on-line resources for research.  And they will discuss how to fund  their work, write grant proposals, and report their work in  journals.  Participant time will generally be evenly divided  between lectures (during morning and early afternoon session) and  application (at evening observing sessions).  The participants will  also be encouraged to develop one short set of instructional  materials or outline a student project based on their research  interest.  The format has evolved from previous workshops.",
