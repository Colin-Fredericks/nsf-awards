 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research portion of this CAREER project seeks to  develop a  conceptual framework and prototypes for an organizational  learning  approach to software development.    The project addresses the codification of  knowledge as it emerges  in development organizations.  The goal is a form that can be  used as the  basis for the continual improvement of software products and the  development process.  A domain lifecycle methodology is being  developed that  shifts the focus from individual projects to  recurring design problems and  solutions developed by an  organization.  The research is based on empirical  observations of  a large software development organization.  Project goals  include:  (1) Creation of reuse-based software development  methodologies  incorporating organizational learning tools; (2)  Development of domain knowledge  from individual cases to design  guidelines to formal reasoning systems  supporting domain-oriented  design; (3) Development of prototype systems using  case-based  technology to support organizational learning; (4) Provision of a body  of  empirical results based on studies of real world development  projects and  evaluations of prototypes supporting organizational  learning.    The  educational goals of this project are to: (1) develop active  learning techniques  for teaching software design concepts; (2)  stimulate lifelong learning through  organizational learning  techniques.  While organizational learning is  integrated with the  research portion of this project, active learning  techniques are  explored through the development of a multimedia design studio  for teaching software design concepts.",
