 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research Program.  This is a study of the factors contributing to the incidence and prominence of private pensions as well as the relation between private and public pensions.  Theoretical issues deal with the role of  old age pensions in the growth and transformation of the welfare state.  Countries compared are Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the United States, and New Zealand.  Analysis is based on systematic qualitiative comparisons, case studies, and quantitative cross-sectional data from 1960 to 1990.  %%%   This research will contribute to the sociological understanding of  the origins and effects of pension policies and the changing nature of the welfare state.  By examining alternative policies adopted by different states and the implications that follow from these, the findings should be useful to policy makers concerned about the growth of pension entitlements.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
