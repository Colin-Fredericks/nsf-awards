 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mauldin  9502952        Our project consists of three sections. In the first section we propose to    deal with infinite systems of conformal maps, investigating the topological and    geometric structure of the corresponding limit set. We intend to study and to    compare conformal, invariant, harmonic, Hausdorff and packing measures in a    general setting as well as in the case of some special systems primarily given    by irregular systems, continued fractions with restricted entries and    apollonian packings. We also plan to explore the problem of conjugacies of such    systems, to study random systems and invariant continua for attractors and    repellors. In the second section we plan to deal with the phase transitions of    pressure on Julia sets and integral means of Riemann maps of a simply connected    basin of attraction to a periodic stable point or rationally indifferent    periodic point. We intend to provide appropriate definitions of pressure, to    establish relations between pressure and integral means and to investigate the    phenomenon of phase transitions by means of dynamical systems and thermodynamic    formalism. We also want to explore the geometry and dynamics of equilibrium    states of Holder continuous functions. In particular we are interested in the    asymptotic behavior of of iterates of the Perron-Frobenius operator and the    sequence of random variables generated by Holder continuous functions.    In the last section we propose to deal with geometry and dynamics of   rational functions with no recurrent critical points in the Julia sets       and Collet-Eckmann maps, exploring the problems of Hausdorff and box         dimension and the influence of critical points on finiteness of              sigma-finite invariant measures. We also plan to study harmonic measures,    beginning with Holder continuity of their Jacobians.        We propose research involving measures and dimensions of various         kinds, for example Hausdorff, packing, conformal, and ha rmonic. These        measures are natural notions of \"volume\" in the spaces and objects we        study. Such spaces and objects may be given by some algorithm which   allows us to approximate the final object and volume step by step. These   spaces also have some natural \"motion\" or dynamics acting on them. Our   research involves developing techniques which allow us to study both   geometric and dynamic features of our system. The specific problems of   this proposal arise from many contexts and their solutions will involve a   mixture of techniques from various areas: complex analysis, continua   theory, dynamics, functional analysis-theory of positive operators of the   Perron-Frobenius type, measure theory and probability, statistical   physics-equilibrium states, phase transitions and thermodynamic formalism.  ***",
