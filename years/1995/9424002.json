 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site in Political Science through SUNY, Stony Brook.  The project provides the opportunity for eight undergraduate students to be immersed into an active research environment spanning topics from the demise of consensual norms on the U.S. Supreme Court to the propensity of nations to wage war as a function of their prior war experience.  The students will work as apprentices under the close supervision of faculty mentors and experienced graduate students.  The goal is to introduce students to the latest, state-of-the-art equipment and methodological techniques.  Also, students will be introduced to ethical aspects of scientific research through a series of six seminars focusing on current ethical questions in social research.  In addition to the research experience, participants will receive academic counseling and have access to a variety of support services.  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
