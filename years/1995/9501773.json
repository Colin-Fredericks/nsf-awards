 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  lateral structural characterization of organic and inorganic layers  in the nanometer length domain.  During the tenure of this three-  year continuing grant, Professor Buratto and his students at the  University of California - Santa Barbara will utilize near-field  scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) in conjunction with established  spectroscopic techniques to probe the local structure and dynamics  of thin-film optical and opto-electronic materials with nanometer  resolution and single molecule sensitivity.  Component clustering,  conformational analysis, molecular ordering, and environment  fluctuations of self-assembled monolayer and multilayer films,  conducting and semiconducting polymer films, and inorganic  semiconductor quantum structures will be examined.  Charge carrier  transport, diffusion, and trapping in these systems will also be  characterized.  These studies should provide useful insights into  the role of localized chemistry and physics in the performance of  these materials.  Also during this grant period, Professor Buratto  will pursue an educational development plan that includes the broad  introduction of laser spectroscopy in undergraduate physical and  analytical chemistry courses, and the development of new courses in  nonlinear optics and microscopy for advanced undergraduate and  graduate students.    The ability to characterize optical and opto-electronic materials  in the nanoscale regime is essential to understanding the  structure-performance relationships of these technologically  important systems.  Through application of near-field scanning  optical microscopy and other complementary optical spectroscopic  techniques, this CAREER research project will lead to a fundamental  understanding of the local chemistry and physics of these thin-film  organic and inorganic materials, as well as insights into  relationships between local ord er/disorder and materials  performance.  The educational development aspects of this CAREER  project will enrich the physical and analytical chemistry  curriculum available to undergraduate and graduate students at the  University of California - Santa Barbara.",
