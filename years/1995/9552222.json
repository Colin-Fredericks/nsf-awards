 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent progress toward a research-based curriculum in geology  emphasizes the use of optical microscopy and the interaction of  electromagnetic radiation with matter in the study of geological  problems.   This project enhances these curricular changes with  the implementation of a research-grade petrographic microscope  that includes 35-mm photography and video capabilities.    Improvements resulting from this project include enhanced  demonstration capabilities throughout the course curriculum;  greater comprehension of scientific methods and principles by  non-science-majors and potential science majors in introductory  courses; the exposure of undergraduate majors to modern  petrographic techniques that previously were not possible; and  the enhancement of independent research projects.  The microscope  and video/photographic system makes the study of rocks and  minerals more appealing to non-science-majors and facilitates the  application of rock and mineral studies as a means to  understanding the composition and evolution of the Earth,  environmental problems, and the origin and evolution of life in  introductory courses.   Use of the imaging capabilities to  demonstrate optical techniques to students in Mineralogy enhances  the comprehension of optics theory and techniques resulting in  increased student use of optical methods as investigative tools  later in the course and in other upper-level courses.   The  microscope/imaging system is also being used to involve students  in interactive laboratory projects in courses in mineralogy,  petrology, structural geology, economic geology, sedimentology,  and paleontology.   Finally, the research-grade petrographic  microscope with modern imaging capabilities enhances the quality  of undergraduate research publications, presentations, and  reports resulting from independent projects, honors projects, and  senior capstone projects that are now required for graduation.",
