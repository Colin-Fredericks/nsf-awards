 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hobbs  9521603    Existing planning tools do not calculate expected production  costs while considering transmission limitations.  Further,  present frameworks for comparing distributed resources against  transmission and distribution (T&D) investments and centralized  resources lack a theoretical basis for the appropriate  development and use of marginal cost information.  We propose the  following research efforts to fill those gaps:    *    Development and demonstration of methods for assessing the       effect of transmission limits upon expected costs.  The       methods would exploit a multiarea probabilistic production       costing framework incorporating DC and AC network       representations.  Existing probabilistic multiarea methods,       aside from inefficient Monte Carlo approaches, do not       include DC or AC flow models.  This work would be of benefit       to utilities by allowing them to assess the long run       implications of resources and transmission decisions for       production costs while rigorously considering transmission       limitations and the entire range of possible load and       equipment states.  It could also benefit non-utility       providers of electric power, large power consumers, and       regulators by providing them a means of better understanding       the spatial cost structure of the bulk power market.    *    Creation of a theoretically defensible yet practical       framework for using such information for evaluating       resources and transactions.  Decomposition methods would be       used to develop theoretically optimal approaches for       coordinating models for generation planning, bulk power       system operation, and transmission and distribution       planning.  Guidelines and procedures would be defined for       theoretically correct calculation of marginal costs and       coordination of models.  This effort would be especially       valuable to the many electric utilities who are beginning to       evaluate the merits of dist ributed versus centralized       generation and demand-side resources.  Some utilities are       presently testing ad hoc procedures involving coordination       of distribution planning methods with bulk power planning       and power flow models.    ****",
