 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the general problem of translating  policies designed to raise standards in math and science education  into classroom practice.  It attempts to identify how three  different types of mechanisms-management-based mechanisms,  professionally-based mechanisms, and client-based mechanisms-exert  pressure and provide support for teachers to eo upgrade  instructional practices.  It also examines how the efficacy of  these different mechanisms varies across different settings, in  particular settings serving students from different SES  backgrounds.  The project involves intensive and detailed fieldwork  in 14 schools:  12 public schools, half located in central cities  and half located in suburban areas, and 2 private schools.  Schools  were selected form two states representing different policy  contexts.  data include interview data from district and school  administrators, teachers, and parents; surveys of parents and  teachers; logs of parent-principal and parent-teacher interaction;  and review of classroom tasks.  The study is designed to provide an  early indication of the progress of reforms by analyzing the local  mechanisms which promote them.  It will also identify areas of  possible concern which may require policy attention.",
