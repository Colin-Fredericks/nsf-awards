Students will perform 3 student-authored exercises,  requiring them to apply research methodology to psychological  research in the areas of (1) sensation and perception, (2)  cognitive processes and (3) learning and memory.  They may share  their experiments with other undergraduate psychology laboratories  networked through the Internet (MacLaboratory for Psychology  Project).  The equipment will serve approximately 240 students  during the first full year of operation.  The laboratory will also  have a multiplier effect by facilitating students' rigorous  application of experimental research methods to issues discussed  and examined in advanced course work.  The lab will also be used by  students for independent studies research, honors theses and an  advanced undergraduate computer applications course work.  The  laboratory serves the important function of integrating aspects of  our curriculum that are currently segregated, e.g., statistical  concepts, experimental research methodology and specific content  areas in our core experimental curriculum.",
