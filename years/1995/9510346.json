 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career Advancement Award project is in the area of surface  chemistry and in the subfield of interfacial vibrational  spectroscopy.  During the tenure of this twelve-month standard  grant, Professor Guest and her students at the University of  Cincinnati will construct a photoelastic modulator-based  ellipsometer suitable for fast, in situ monitoring of the air-water  interface.  This apparatus will be used to demonstrate  ellipsometric detection of adsorbed gases at the air-aqueous  interface which represents an advance in the application of  ellipsometry.  This method has potential for development into an  non-invasive, time-resolved monitor of gas coverage, depletion, and  chemical reaction on liquid surfaces.  In combination with other  interfacially sensitive probes, this technique is expected to offer  unambiguous new insights into the kinetics, dynamics, and  spectroscopy of gaseous adsorbates at the air-aqueous interface.  This Career Advancement Award project reflects Professor Guest's  overall effort to revector her research direction toward the area  of gas-liquid interfacial phenomena.  A particular focus of this  present work is the development of an ellipsometric approach to the  study of heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry.",
