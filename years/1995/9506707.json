 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506707    Duraiswami      The research is directed at developing a PC-based, user-friendly, on-board multitasking ship maneuvering simulator incorporating operation in confined water and under the action of wind and waves.  The objectives are to extend the multi-objective identification method to on-board identification using on-board measurements; reduce structural uncertainty in the model through invoking alternative mathematical models for the same ship and create a database of models for various types of ships and different environment conditions.  This would lead to the development of multitasking software for simulating several ships simultaneously and its implementation with a user-friendly and realistic graphical interfaces.      A library of mathematical models for different ship configurations, and environmental conditions of wind, sea state, proximity of channel-sides and walls will be created based on existing fundamental models for ship hydrodynamics.  A new multiobjective identification approach that uses a set of mathematical models for parameter identification of the same system will also be developed to reduce structural uncertainty of the model.  These developments will allow simulation of different types of ships navigating in critically important situations.",
