 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417803    Spiders are unique in their use of orb-webs to capture prey.  Orb-weaving  spiders  and  their  webs  have  attracted  the  attention  of  biologists who study behavior,  ecology,  and  evolution  as  well  as  the  interest  of  biochemists  and  molecular biologists who study the properties of   the  silk  spiders manufacture to build those webs.  The ability of  an  orb-web  to  capture  prey depends  in  large  part  on  the  stickiness  of  its  prey  capture threads.   Without  these  threads, many insects that strike a web would escape  before  a spider could run to and subdue them.  Prey capture threads  also  help absorb the impact of prey that strike a web  and,  in  this  way, strengthen the web.  The properties of  these  prey  capture  threads, however, have received  very  little  study.  This research will examine changes in the properties  of   prey  capture  threads  and  determine  how  they   are  associated  with  the origin, evolution,  and  operation  of  spider   orb-webs.    The   most  primitive   orb-webs   are  horizontally  oriented  and  contained  dry,  fuzzy  capture  threads  called cribellar thread.  More advanced and diverse  groups  of  orb-weaving spiders produce vertically  oriented  orb-webs  that  contain  viscous adhesive  capture  threads.  This research will measure the stickiness, tensile strength,  and extensibility of the prey capture threads from webs that  are less highly organized than orb-webs, orb-webs containing  cribellar thread, and orb-webs containing adhesive  threads.  The  research will test the hypotheses that the precise  and  parsimonious  architecture of orb-webs places a  premium  on  the  stickiness,  tensile  strength,  and  extensibility  of  capture threads; and that these characteristics become  even  more   critical  in  vertical  orb-webs  whose   orientation  requires   them  to  absorb  greater  forces  because   they  intercept  prey  that fly faster.  It  will  also  show  how  stickiness of cribellar prey captur e threads is related to a  spider's  spinning anatomy and determine whether changes  in  spinning anatomy facilitated the origin of the orb-web.  The  information  and  insights gained from this comparison  will  answer major questions about the evolution of orb-webs, more  fully characterize the functional properties of spider silk,  and foster a more integrated view of spider web composition,  structure,  and function.  These insights may ultimately  be  useful in the design of  composite materials and adhesive or  impact-absorbing structures.",
