 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501785  Lester  In close collaboration with the University of New Mexico's (UNM)1  established group-III nitride (III-N) MOCVD growth effort, a study  of innovative processes to improve the fabrication technology for  III-N optoelectronic devices is proposed.  A contact metallization  will be developed that will improve dopant activation and contact  resistance by actively scavenging the hydrogen that causes  compensation in MOCVD grown III-Ns.  Compared to other methods of  extracting hydrogen, such as thermal annealing, this approach will  have the advantage of preventing surface dissociation that is  detrimental to contact formation.  This new contact scheme will  also be used in conjunction with hydrogen-based reactive ion  etching (RIE) to develop novel, low-damage etch processes for pre-  metallization surface preparation.  A dry-etching process will also  be developed for the fabrication of laser mirrors to replace the  difficult task of cleaving III-Ns grown on sapphire.  With these  better processes, III-N LEDs and diode lasers will be fabricated to  characterize by optical and electrical pumping the radiative  processes found in III-N materials and to determine the effect of  dislocations on device operation.  The ultimate goal of the   research effort--the development of a reliable, blue diode laser--  would be a major technological innovation and is critical towards  improving the storage capacity and affordability of high-density  optical media and the quality of optical displays.    In the educational field, emphasis will be placed on teaching  students the scientific and communications skills that will make  them more competitive in the job market and better able to interact  with and motivate their fellow scientists and engineers.   Educational activities will focus on new course development in the  area of II-V semiconductor device fabrication and testing,  undergraduate and graduate research advising, outreach activities  to local high schools to promote the study of engineeri ng in  college, the involvement of traditionally underrepresented groups  in research, and the mentoring of graduate students in industry  through summer job employment.  ***",
