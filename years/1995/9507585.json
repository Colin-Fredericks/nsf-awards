 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marks/Monigal    Under the direction of Dr. Anthony Marks, Ms. Katherine Monigal  will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will study  collections of lithic materials which have been excavated from  Mousterian sites in Israel and are stored in museums in both the  United States and Israel. The lithics are all attributable to an  archaeological industry termed \"Tabun-D\"; are all older than  40,000 years and may span a period of up to 200,000 years. The  sites themselves are located in a number of environmental  regions. Ms. Monigal will describe and measure a large number of  attributes on selected pieces and with these data will  reconstruct the technology used to make stone tools.  Archaeologists traditionally focus on the final products which  are produced and not on the process used to reach this end. With  the data collected, Ms. Monigal will then compare Tabun-D sites  across time and environmental subzone, attempt to determine  whether technological data support the incorporation of these  sites into a single cultural tradition and try to explain the  causes of variation which may be observed.    Based on work in Europe, archaeologists have argued that the  production of certain stone tool types, such as blades, is  tightly associated with anatomically modern humans. In this  region of the world, the emergence of blade producing industries  dates to about 40,000 years ago. However, as Ms. Monigal and  others have noted, blades appear much earlier in sites in the  Near East and a number of assemblages support this conclusion.  Using this single characteristic, archaeologists have grouped  these occurrences under the heading \"Tabun-D.\" However it is very  unclear what this designation means in social terms and whether  the makers of this industry belonged to the same group or  tradition. Until this is done, it is not possible to ask whether  this data is relevant to questions such as the emergence of  anatomically modern humans. Through her study of technological  process, Ms. Mo nigal will be able to address this question in an  original way.    This research is important for several reasons. It will produce  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will providfe insight  into the emergence of modern humans and help to train a promising  young scientist.",
