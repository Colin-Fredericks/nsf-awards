 "awd_abstract_narration": "Presidential advisers play a central role in controlling the flow of information to the chief executive, defining problems, and persuading the president to embark on specific courses of action.  Few studies, however, have examined systematically the patterns of communication between a president and his advisers, and fewer still have explored how these patterns change over time.  This research uses archival data, in particular the president's daily diary schedules, to examine the communication patterns between the president and other executive branch officials in the Nixon and Carter administrations.  The research considers how institutional, interpersonal, and environmental factors contribute to the initial development and subsequent evolution of these patterns.  In doing so, the project employs social network concepts and techniques.  Ultimately, the research will clarify and test some of the fundamental behavioral and institutional assumptions that underlie current theories of communication within advisory networks.",
