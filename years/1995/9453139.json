It is a cooperative effort of women faculty  at the College of Staten Island (CSI) and Staten Island Technical High School (SI TECH).  The  project initiates the expansion of an existing program operating at the college to the high school  level, and lays the foundation for broader expansion to additional colleges within the City  University of New York (CUNY) system.  CSI undergraduate women are to develop a  computerized tracking system for SI Tech graduates.  CSI women undergraduates and alumnae  are to give lectures at SI Tech.  Stipends are to be provided for undergraduate women to work  on summer research with faculty mentors.  A women and computers \"exposition\" is to be hosted  with high school students and their parents invited.  SI Tech is to host a seminar where CSI  women faculty and students participate in a panel discussion with SI Tech girls in the audience.   An \"adopt-a-high school-student\" program, where undergraduates at CSI will mentor high school  students, is to be initiated.  An electronic questionnaire to capture information from the student  participants is to be developed.  A questionnaire and a tracking system are to be used for  outcome analysis.  High school and college information kits are to be produced and  disseminated.  ***",
