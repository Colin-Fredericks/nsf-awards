 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502766   LeFloch      This work is supported by a National Science Foundation   Faculty Early    Career Development Award.  The research component will focus   on the    study of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws; these laws   are essential to    the description of a large number of problems in continuum   mechanics,    from fluid dynamics to material science (e.g., multiphase   flows, propagation    of interfaces).  The plan will have two major goals: (1) to   provide new    insight on the nonlinear stability of entropy discontinuous   solutions and on    the design and nonlinear analysis of shock-capturing   numerical methods    and (2) to contribute to better understanding of several   applied problems    from physical sciences admitting non-standard shock waves.    The education    component will include curriculum development at the   graduate level,    disseminating the research into the scientific community,   including    industrial laboratories, and directing the work of students,   emphasizing    collaborative activities with engineers and researchers in   the physical    sciences.      The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the   early    development of academic faculty as both educators and   researchers.  The    Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a   Foundation-   wide  program that provides for the support of junior   faculty within the    context of their overall career development.  It combines in   a single    program the support of quality research and education in the   broadest sense    and the full participation of those traditionally   underrepresented in science    and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the   importance    the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced   academic    careers which include both research and education.",
