 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth in size and complexity of modern computers is matched by  the need for more accurate models of their internal wiring  structure.  The task of modeling this complexity is ideally suited  to a recent development in statistical physics called the re-  normalization group.  It has the power to attack the wiring  optimization problem because it takes this one very difficult  problem and breaks it up into a very large number of much simpler  problems.  Rather than attempting to attack the entire range of  partitioning and placement requirements from the transistor level  to the back-plane, an optimization procedure need only be found for  a highly restricted wire length range.  Once this has been derived,  the procedure is renormalized for all other length scales in a  manner which generates a system-wide solution.  This project will  investigate how such an approach may be used to develop much better  estimates of interconnect-limited system performance and how this  theory leads to new optimization algorithms.  In contrast to other  theories  the predictions made by this technique will grow ever  more accurate as the systems grow larger and more complex.",
