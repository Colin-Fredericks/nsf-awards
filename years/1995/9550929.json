 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funds to install an educational water well  field laboratory for the purposes of teaching hydrogeologic  principles, groundwater resource evaluation, and contaminant  remediation.   The field consists of five wells variously spaced  and 200 feet deep.   The wells are fully instrumented to permit  measurement of aquifer hydraulics in a heterogeneous,  anisotropic, unconfined aquifer, as well as long-term monitoring  of water quality, static water level, and local precipitation.    The key instrumentation is an in situ water level  transducer/water quality probe/precipitation gauge datalogging  system that allows monitoring on a variety of time scales and  downloading to a portable computer for further analysis on and  off site.   This faaility permits the university to expand the  hydrogeology component of the geology and environmental science  curriculum at introductory and upper course levels at a time when  many students are entering the hydrogeology job and graduate  school market.   Hydrogeologic principles and their application  to water resources management and contaminant remediation are  being taught through a series of discovery laboratories at the  well field site.   The emphasis is placed on directed activities  that include the collection, analysis, and interpretation of  hydrogeologic data commonly preformed by a professional  hydrogeologist.   The level of sophistication increases at each  course level in the curriculum.   Introductory students explore  the surface and subsurface processes in the hydrologic cycle.    Upper-level students perform and evaluate pump/slug tests, water  sampling and chemical analysis, contaminant plume simulation,  well field siting methods, and geophysical logging techniques.    Student independent research projects can take advantage of the  unique site location between a perennial groundwater feed stream,  impermeable diabase dikes, and high-volume springs.",
