 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this five-year system-wide project is to double  the number of minority graduates of Birmingham Public Schools (BPS)  who are prepared to enter college as science, mathematics,  engineering, and technology majors.  To accomplish this goal, BPS  has established a collaborative relationship involving the  University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Birmingham Compact, and  the Alabama Alliance for Minority Participation Program.  Project  activities will have an impact on all 43,000 BPS students in grades  K-12 and their 976 teachers of science and mathematics.  However,  most academic enhancement activities will serve teachers in grades  6-12.  To achieve the project goal, these objectives will be  implemented: reform and enrich the K-12 science and mathematics  curricula, using national standards in mathematics and science as  guidelines; promote K-12 school-based leadership; enhance teachers'  content knowledge and increase the use of effective instructional  strategies in mathematics and science; provide students with a  range of integrated enrichment activities; provide students with  effective social support networks; implement a plan for effective  use of school resources; and infuse appropriate technology into K-  12 instructional activities.  Project processes and outcomes will  be monitored through a comprehensive and integrated evaluation  model.  Formative feedback will be used to improve project  functions throughout the duration of the grant.  Project  descriptions outcomes will be thoroughly documented and will be  disseminated in various formats to a range of audiences.  BPS,  because of its unique history, demographics, and economic  situation, offers a unique challenge for systemic reform.  The  success of this project may serve as a national model for other  similar school systems.  ***",
