 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will design, implement and experiment with an  operating system that satisfies the requirements of emerging  applications such  as multimedia, parallel computing, and  distributed information retrieval. These  performance critical  applications can be characterized by their intense use of  communication, and by their need for tight control of the  machine's resources.  Existing operating systems often limit  the performance of such applications,  thereby preventing  users from reaping the power of high-performance computer  systems. As a result, lagging operating system technology  threatens to delay  the acceptance of parallel computing,  multimedia, and other services in the  emerging national  information infrastructure.    The major themes of the  project  are (1) designing OS  communications support that delivers performance  close to  that provided by the network; (2) achieving OS performance  that  scales with the underlying computer system's  performance; and, (3)  investigating open service  implementations that allow customization of OS  services to  match precisely an application's requirements.  The goal is  to  deliver the resources provided by high-performance  computer systems to  applications, without sacrificing  functionality, fairness, safety, and  portability. Methods  include the re-evaluation of current operating systems in  light of changing application requirements and hardware  performance  characteristics; design, implementation, and  experimentation with appropriate  solutions; and,  dissemination of results through publication and  distpibution  of software artifacts.    Education plans of this CAREER project include the  development of an interactive teaching style, introduction  of a hands-on course  in parallel programming using networks  of workstations, and the organization of  a summer program  designed to expose junior high students to computer and  information technology.",
