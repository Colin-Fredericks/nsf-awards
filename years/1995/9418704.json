 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418704                    Kauffman           This proposal focuses on testing the stability of cretaceous  climates in the Caribbean Province by analyzing integrated high-  resolution stratigraphic, sedimentologic , paleobiologic and  geochemical data,  in conjunction with climate simulations, to test   the hypothesis of a warmer and more saline core tropical climate  zone - Supertethys (Kauffman and Johnson, 1988) - and to define its  temporal and spatial characteristics.  Tests will be made along two  north-south transects spanning the entire cretaceous paleotropics  and its margins, plotted on the Caribbean plate reconstructions of  Pindell and Barrett (1990), and will utilize a series of three time  slices representing different stages of Cretaceous climate-ocean  history (Late Albian, Early Turonian, Early Maastrichtian).  These  time slices will span    the interval for which paleobiogeographic  and reef diversity data (Johnson, 1993; 1994, in press) propose two  episodes of development and an intervening period of collapse of  Supertethys.  One transect will extend from New Mexico  through  west Texas, Mexico, Central American and western Venezuela (Fig.1);  the second will extend from Oklahoma through central Texas, and  Greater Antilles, Trinidad, the Dutch, West Indies, and eastern  Venezuela to northern Brazil (Fig.1).  For each time slice,  detailed facies analyses of shallow water platform sequences will  be used to independently determine areas of net evaporation,  upwelling , etc.  Stable isotope analyses of unaltered rudisted  bivalve shell material, early marine cements, and foraminifer tests  where available, will allow definition of relative sea surface  (photic zone) temperature/salinity, and characterization of north  to south thermal gradients.  Paleobiological data along the  transects will include species and generic dispersion maps,  taxonomic and ecologic analyses of community composition and  structure, statistically predicted latitudinal diversity gradients,  and ana lyses of paleobiogeographic dispersion, dispersal pathways,  and the taxonomic composition and boundary characteristics of  paleobiogeographic units.  A partial stratigraphic and  paleobiologic  data base exists for each transect and time slice,  enhancing the efficiency of the proposed research.  Integration of  these data sets for each time slice  will allow identification, and  where present, characterization of the supertropical Caribbean  climate zone (Supertethys), its dynamic evolution during the  Cretaceous greenhouse interval, its effect on the evolution,  diversification, and extinction of tropical organisms/ecosystems,  the structure and chemistry of tropical Cretaceous seas, and the  evolution of  Cretaceous paleoclimates.  These data will be  directly applied to testing and modifying Cretaceous climate  simulations generated using the Semtner-Chervin eddy-resolving  ocean general circulation model (Semtner and Chervin, 1988) and the  GENESIS atmospheric general circulation model (Pollard and Thompson  1993a,b) for these same time intervals.",
