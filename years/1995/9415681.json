The conveners  are R. Singh of Ohio State University and B.C.  Nakra of the Indian Institute of Technology,  New Delhi.  The symposium will focus on basic  research issues and emerging technology in  vibration and noise engineering.  This is a  rapidly evolving field in which the need to  address noise pollution and to control noise &  vibration in quality products is well  recognized.  The meeting will address a wide  range of topics such as machine diagnostics,  modal analysis, noise control, smart actuators  and sensors, structural and acoustic intensity  techniques and nonlinear problems in vibration  and acoustics.     Scope:  India is known for  its excellence in engineering.  It is also a  future market for emerging vibration and noise  technologies.  Although many Indian researchers  are pursuing important problems in traditional  areas of vibrations, little research is being  done in other areas such as noise, sound  quality, and diagnostics.  No major national or  international meeting on this subject has been  held in India during the last decade.  There is  a clear need to hold a joint symposium/workshop  in order to stimulate cutting edge research in  this area among Indian researchers, and to  identify key research directions and mutual  research interests.  The proceedings will be  published.    ***",
