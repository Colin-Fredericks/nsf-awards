 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415796  Shankar  The Renormalization Group (RG) has proven its worth many times in  the past, in relativistic field theory and critical phenomena.   Over the last few years the principal investigator has conceived a  way to apply it to nonrelativistic electrons.  The analysis has  yielded a lot of insight into a variety of seemingly disjoint  issues such as Landau Fermi-liquids, BCS instability and Charge  Density wave formation.  It is also a good diagnostic for those who  wish to replace Landau's Fermi-liquid with something else.  In this  research, a variety of new problems in quantum phase transitions  between various states like insulator, CDW, superconductor,  antiferromagnet; fermions coupled to gauge fields (as in the  oxides) etc., will be addressed using the scheme.  %%%  The investigator will pursue his goal of applying the  Renormaliztion Group (as tailored by him to some specific problems  involving nonrelativistic electrons) to a variety of problems in  Condensed matter physics.  The Renormalization Group approach is to  take a difficult problem and break it into smaller ones and do them  one at a time.  It is ideally suited therefore for questions that  arise in problems where strong interactions between electrons or  spins occur, such as in Quantum Antiferromagnets and High Tc  materials.",
