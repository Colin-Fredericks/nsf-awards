Straffin Southern  Illinois University at Carbondale  Dissertation Improvement Research: Fluvial Response to Climate Change and Human Activities, Burgundy,France   The proposed research will develop a model that relates fluvial processes, flood regimes,land-use patterns, and dominant climate regimes for the Arroux-Loire River system in Burgundy, France.  The model will provide for the reconstruction of fluvial responses to past climate and environmental changes, as well as for the prediction of fluvial response to anthropogenic changes in regional climate in the near future.  Documentation of over 200 years of changes in the fluvial landscape will be developed from cartographic and remotely-sensed data.  Those changes will then be interpreted  within the context of  known land-use patterns, and historic changes in climate and river discharge  regimes.  Models developed for the period of historical monitoring  will then be compared with  reconstructions of older alluvial deposits, prehistoric land-use, and correlative proxy  paleoenvironmental data to determine the r elationship between fluvial depositional and erosional  processes and climate regimes over the last 2000 years.  If the model correlates climatic regimes and  fluvial styles, and this is valid for older alluvial deposits, then it may be possible to predict  fluvial responses to future climate change for the same region.  In this way the study provides a  first step towards linking global environmental change with changes in landscape, enabling those  regions with critical land-use needs to better plan for potential future environmental change",
