The clone thus formed has very little genetic variation initially.  Evidently other existing clones are not eliminated.  Recombinational replacements do accumulate, and so the clonal chromosome is comprised by stretches of DNA from other ancestors; the clonal frame, a discontinuous but prominent ancestral sequence type, is still recognizable.  Strains sharing a recognizable clonal frame have been called members of a meroclone.  Eventually the clonal frame is obscured by additional replacements.  Among the representative set of 72 wild \"ECOR\" strains, three major meroclones are recognized on the basis of comparative sequencing, and so far these correspond to the three major groupings according to multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis.  The recombinational replacements are often recognized, by comparative sequencing, to belong to homologous sets; these clonal segments are often on the order of 1 kilobase (kb) in length, though this varies.  The purpose of the present project is to reconcile the observed distribution of discontinuous sequence similarities with the rates and patterns of recombinational replacements.  For example, the DNA molecules introduced into E. coli cells by transduction may be as large as 100 kb; conjugation may transmit much larger molecules.  How are the smaller discontinuities produced?  Recent work suggests that DNA introduced by general transduction in E. coli is often cut up by restriction enzymes, resulting in much smaller replacements which are often multiple and discontinuous. --There is clear evidence for similar restriction effects on conjugation, but some possible indications to the contrary exist as well.  Also, sequence differences (~ 20%) much greater than those generally obser ved among E. coli strains have been shown to block conjugation between species.  Do the smaller (1 -3%) sequence differences have a lesser (modifying) effect on conjugation? --Finally, a computer simulation has demonstrated that patterns comparable to those observed can be generated by successive randomly-placed large replacements.  And certainly whether the replacements are large, small or both, the cumulative effects of recurrent replacement must be considered.  The individual aims of this project are: 1) to expand the existing 12.7 kb region of comparative sequencing into a unique continuous 40-strain, >20 kb database, which will provide insight into DNA sequence variation in bacteria, and aid in the analysis of recombinants in its region; 2) to investigate experimentally, describe and explain the patterns of conjugational replacement between strain k12 and various wild strains of E. coli; 3) to infer the distribution of size and multiplicity of conjugational replacements in nature; 4) to explore the potential cumulative effects of transductional and conjugation recombination in nature by simulation; 5) to consider chromosomally local special characteristics via restriction analysis of PCR fragments; and then 6) to begin work on a quantitative model of the evolution of the chromosome of this species.  %%%  This study of a number of bacterial chromosomes is providing an understanding of the means by which bacteria exchange genes in natural settings.  ***",
