 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416866  Mass        The complex terrain of coastal regions, such as exists along most of the western U.S. coast, has a major  influence on local weather conditions.  The interactions of such terrain with various meteorological phenomena,  however, is not well-understood.        The primary objectives of this project are to study and document: the coastally-trapped disturbances that  propagate along the mountainous coastline of western North America; and the interaction of the large-scale flow  and embedded disturbances (such as cyclones, troughs, and fronts) with coastal topography.        Using an existing research data set collected under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research and  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this research effort will utilize both observational and  numerical modeling approaches.  First, the nature of orographically-trapped events and the interactions of the  synoptic-scale flow and coastal orography under stable summertime conditions will be examined.  Such features are  often associated with significant transitions in temperature, wind, pressure and cloudiness within approximately 100  km of coastal mountains.  Secondly, the project will address how the structures and dynamical balances of synoptic  systems such as troughs and fronts change as they approach and cross a mountainous coastline during wintertime,  less stable conditions.  Such  systems are often associated with significant coastal weather features such as mesoscale  coastal ridging, coastal jets and alongshore surges.  ***",
