 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to investigate the late  Quaternary paleoenvironmental conditions of the Noatak basin in  northwestern Alaska.  The Noatak basin is a broad lowland in the  western Brooks Range of Alaska, drained by the west-flowing  Noatak River. During the late Pleistocene, large glaciers  extended down the Noatak River valley and terminated within the  basin. Other glaciers that originated farther west in the DeLong  Mountains flowed eastward into the basin, damming the Noatak  River and forming a succession of lakes with surface areas as  large as 4400 square kilometers. This project will bring together  a combination of approaches, including paleoecological analyses  (pollen, plant macrofossils, and insects), stratigraphy, and  geomorphology, to understand the paleoenvironmental records  preserved in deposits in the numerous large bluffs along the  Noatak and Cutler Rivers. The research focuses on organic-rich  sediments exposed in the bluffs. Basic stratigraphic and  geomorphologic mapping of these bluffs has already been  accomplished and test samples taken for paleoecological study in  1993 and 1994 have yielded abundant, well-preserved macrofossils  (plants and insects) and pollen assemblages. This project will  yield significant paleoenvironmental data that will be placed in  well-constrained chronological and stratigraphic contexts.         The Noatak basin contains an excellent record of the last  glacial/interglacial cycle, preserved in a series of organic  deposits exposed in river bluffs. Poorly drained lake beds cover  the floor of the Noatak basin, and associated end moraines  reflect glacial advances from mountains to the north, east, and  west. During interglacial and interstadial intervals, the Noatak  River and its tributaries incised these glacial deposits and  glaciolacustrine complexes. They formed gravel-filled channels  capped by organic-rich bog, marsh, and floodplain deposits. Sixty-  two measured sections of river-bluff exposures provide a record  o f depositional facies across the lake floor. The sedimentary  sequences exposed in the bluffs define multiple glacial advances  and corresponding lake stages separated by fluvial sediments of  both interstadial and interglacial character. Peat beds and  organic-rich silt horizons from floodplain deposits have yielded  identifiable wood, plant macrofossils, pollen, and insect  remains, and other fossils that serve as biostratigraphic markers  and provide paleoecological information.  Peats and organic-rich  silts and sands were deposited during several key intervals  throughout the last 135,000 years. The nine study sites that are  part of this project include organic deposits that most likely  date to the last interglacial period, the Boutellier (mid-  Wisconsin) interstadial, the late Wisconsin maximum, (27,000-  17,000 years ago), the late glacial interval (13,500-10,000 years  ago), and the Holocene.         The study region lies within the Noatak National Preserve,  one of the proposed component parks of the U.S./Russian Beringia  International Park. Its position near the eastern margin of the  Bering Land Bridge places it within a region where organic-rich  riparian habitats prevailed during even the last glacial maximum.  Paleoecological studies in the Noatak basin are essential to help  decipher an unusually long and complex record of Pleistocene  glaciation, modern landscape formation, and biotic response to  climate change. These studies will also provide the environmental  underpinning of the rich archaeological record that is presently  being reconstructed in the Noatak region.",
