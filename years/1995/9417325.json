 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417325  Berner    The weathering of Ca and Mg silicate minerals on the continents,  followed by the precipitation of the liberated Ca and Mg in the  oceans as carbonates, has exerted a major control on the level of  atmospheric CO2 over geologic time.  An important aspect of this  process is the role played by plants as they modify the rate of  mineral dissolution during weathering.  Did the rise and evolution  of vascular land plants over the Phanerozoic affect the rate of  silicate weathering, and in turn   the level of atmospheric CO2?   From petrographic studies using the electron microprobe we have  discovered that on the island of Hawaii the growth of vascular  plants on young basalt flows results in intense etching and removal  of Ca and Mg silicates in the vicinity of plant rootlets.  As a  result relative rates of initial weathering under higher plants  were found to be much greater than under lichens or in the absence  of any plant life.   Similarly at Mt. St. Helens we found that a  ten year old volcanic ash deposit shows evidence of chemical  alteration immediately adjacent to plant rootlets but no evidence  away from the rootlets.  Although this petrographic study has been  useful in a qualitative to semi-quantitative sense, there is a need  for a better way to quantify the effects of plants on silicate  weathering.  This can be done through the study of the chemistry of  solutions draining the rocks.    Our preliminary water chemical results of a multiyear ongoing  controlled experiment on the effects of young growing trees and  grass on silicate weathering, conducted under natural outdoor  conditions at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest Station in New  Hampshire, indicate a minimum silicate weathering rate enhancement  by the trees of a factor of 1.5-3.5.  We propose to check this  result by examining the chemistry of waters draining the basaltic  rocks of Iceland.  Iceland is ideal for our proposed study in that  the rocks are rich in volcanic glass and Ca and Mg silicates ,  contain no CaCO3, are young enough that variations in the degree of  vegetational coverage is present, anthropogenic acid rain is absent  and spring and stream waters can be easily sampled.  (Water  sampling on the island  of Hawaii was impossible due to the great  permeability of those young basalt flows  that exhibit variations  in plant coverage.)  A reconnaissance visit to Iceland shows that  there are several localities where waters can be collected from  vegetated and unvegetated areas that are sufficiently nearly to one  another that they share the same bedrock lithology, microclimate,  aspect. etc.  This makes it possible to conduct an experiment on  the quantitative role of the local plant life on silicate  weathering.  Also, there is considerable expertise already  available on the chemistry of weathering solutions in Iceland, in  the person of Dr. Sigurdur Gislason, and we will be assisted by him  in the field.  Dr. Gislason's preliminary chemical data on  Icelandic spring waters suggest that the effect of plants on  weathering rate should be substantial.",
