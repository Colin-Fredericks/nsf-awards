The research topics are motivated by practical problems   and the main focus is on estimation and (approximate) computation   procedures. The research aims to significantly advance statistical   knowledge in these areas, and improve some current practices in   survey agencies in particular. In attacking some of the proposed   problems, small sample asymptotic methods are desired. The   potential use of accurate saddlepoint approximations in these   problems is studied. In other proposed problems, large sample   asymptotic methods are investigated. The research topics include  kernel-type estimations in regression when data are partially   missing or measured with error; sub-domain estimation in sample   surveys; and new and optimal estimation of the distribution   function of a finite population.       In this research project new statistical theory and methods are  developed and investigated in statistical problems that bear   practical importance. The accuracy and simplicity are the main criteria  in developing such statistical methods. They have direct applications   in various agencies, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to   improve the accuracy and speed of the current statistical practice.   Furthermore, this research advances the science and technology  in the Federal Strategic Areas of high performance computing and  the statistical aspects of biotechnology.",
