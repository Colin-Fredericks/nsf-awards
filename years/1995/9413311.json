 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.- Western European collaboration in logic programming.  The investigators are Evan Tick, University of Oregon, Andrew King, University of Southampton in the United Kingdom, Peter Van Roy, Max Planck Society, and Manual Hermenegildo, Technical University of Madrid.  They propose research on  three topics in the analysis and implementation of concurrent logic programming: design of  common intermediate language for high-level concurrent language compilers; design of partitioning algorithms for high-level concurrent languages; and design of execution models for concurrent  logic languages.  Practical engineering solutions to problems in compilation, optimization, and runtime execution will be emphasized.  The U.S. and European investigators bring to this collaboration complementary expertise in the implementation of logic programming languages.  The project takes advantage of European resources and investment in studies on techniques for abstract interpretation and its application to problems of parallel execution of logic programming.  Their collaboration will advance understanding of the application of logic programming to parallel programming.",
