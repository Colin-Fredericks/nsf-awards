 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university's chemistry department serves a student population  that is attending graduate school in rapidly increasing numbers.    To help these students and to stimulate even more to pursue this  path, the department is developing an engaging new program of  upper-level electives.   This program must provide the advanced  electives required for the professional major, excite students  about continuing their education, and convey to them the true  interdisciplinary nature of chemistry.   The chemistry department  has chosen to design a program to teach air-sensitive synthesis  to undergraduates.   This program fills the departmental need for  advanced synthetic course work with electives designed to  illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry seen in  fields such as organometallics and material science.   As the  focal point, the university is currently building an  undergraduate teaching lab dedicated to the art of air-sensitive  synthesis/manipulation.   This project specifically funds a  single station inert atmosphere glove box as the one remaining  item required for the completion of this facility.   Since much  of air-sensitive chemistry involves producing and handling  air-sensitive products, it is unrealistic to omit these from a  student's training.   Glove box use is not only the best way to  handle these products, it is also the most efficient, student  friendly, way to teach a laboratory class of this type.   Its  acquisition allows electives in Organometallics and Advanced  Synthetic Techniques to include a complete and relevant lab  component.",
