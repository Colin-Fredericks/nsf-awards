 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422216  Williams    The research to be carried out will have an impact on (1) extragalactic  astronomy: the structure and energy generation of quasars and other  active galactic nuclei (AGN) are investigated, on (2) cosmology: the  formation of galaxies in the early Universe are investigated, and on (3)  a combination of galactic astronomy and cosmology: dark matter and  gamma-ray bursts are investigated.  The project involves theoretical,  numerical, and statistical investigations.     In Part I of this project, the physics of general relativistic,  supermassive Kerr-Newman black holes are used to model AGN.  Monte Carlo  simulations of Penrose processes are used to model the extraction of  energy from the ergosphere; and large scale electromagnetic fields are  used to generate the jets.  In Part II, electromagnetic and gravitational  fields in a Friedmann cosmology are used to model the formation of  supermassive stars, near the time of recombination in the early Universe.      In Part III, low energy black holes of negligible emissions will be used  to model dark matter in the Universe.     Finally, in Part IV, black holes that undergo periods of being active and  inactive are used to model gamma-ray bursters.     The objective of the research is (1) to show that the Kerr-Newman black  holes can explain the energy source of AGN; (2) to show how rotation,  magnetic fields, and particle-field interactions can produce the  necessary gravitational instabilities needed in the early Universe to  allow the formation of supermassive stars of approximately 10 Million  Solar masses (these stars could be the progenitors of the supermassive  black holes believed to power AGN); and (3) to show that using black  holes to model two poorly understood phenomena in the Universe: dark  matter and gamma-ray bursts, can give promising results in explaining the  nature of the original sources.",
