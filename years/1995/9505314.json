Travel funds are  requested to support U.S. invited speakers and Ph.D. students.  The  purpose of the meeting is to bring together top researchers - whose  expertise spans material design, material characterization, device  fabrication, and integrated device architectures - to the intimate  setting of a small town to discuss and assess progress in the  field.  This upcoming conference is motivated by two previous NSF-  supported conferences that were held in Pullman, Washington in the  summer of 1992 and in Val Thorens, France in the Winter of 1994  (ICONO'1).  This proposed meeting would be the third in the series  of meetings that we plan to hold every 18 months.  The demand for  such a meeting was evidenced by full-capacity attendance of  ICONO'1.  The strategy is to hold this meeting in those countries  that are active in this field.  At the ICONO'1 meeting, U.S. and  other non-European attendees had the opportunity to learn about a  large array of European research activities that are normally not  represented at U.S. conferences.  ***",
