The corrosion behavior of  gamma  titanium aluminide, alpha-two titanium aluminide,  alpha-two/gamma titanium aluminide, and pure  constituent metals is examined  in aqueous solutions  of potassium nitrate, potassium sulfate, potassium  hydroxide, nitric acid and sulfuric acid.  Scanning  and timed electrochemical experiments are performed in  deaerated, non-deaerated, and oxygen-saturated  solutions to determine the effects of solution  aeration on corrosion behavior.   Microscopic  investigations are employed to characterize the  surface of the corroded intermetallics.   The  structural information will be correlated with the  observed electrochemical behavior.  This is the first  time such a study has been made on titanium aluminides  with controlled microstructures.  %%%  This grant contributes to the understanding of the  corrosion behavior of titanium-aluminide  intermetallics  with non-homogenous microstructures.  Gamma titanium-aluminide alloys offer great promise  for applications in the aerospace industry.  A  practical output of these investigations will be  information applicable to the development of  electrochemical  machining techniques for titanium  aluminide.  ***",
