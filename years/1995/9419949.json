 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for the purchase of a multi-user laser scanning  confocal microscope and associated workstation to be housed in the  Electron Microscopy Facility of the Department of Biological Sciences,  University of Maryland Baltimore County. No such instrument is  currently available on the Catonsville Campus of the University of  Maryland System. The applicants have been using traditional  epifluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy and fluorescent  activated cell sorting for the study of cell structure, function and  problems in spatial and temporal localization of developmentally  regulated macromolecules. The availability of a laser scanning confocal  microscope would substantially enhance these research efforts by  improving resolution in the x-y plane by a factor of 2 and in the Z  axis by ~1.4x. Additionally the ability to take optical sections and do  3-D image reconstruction and analysis will enable us to address aspects  of these problems which had previously been impossible. All of the  applicants hold federal grants for the support of their research and  several are recipients of NSF grants.    The instrument will consist of a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 confocal laser  scanning unit mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert Inverted Fluorescence  Microscope fitted with phase and Nomarski optics in order to overlay  the confocal fluorescent images on the brightfield images. Image  collection and control of the microscope will be managed by a 486 (or  appropriate upgrade) computer running the Bio-Rad CoMOS software. The  data will be stored on an optical disc drive. The 486 computer will be  hooked by an ethernet link to the department Silicon Graphics Indigo  Computer. Vital Images Volume Microscope Workbench software will be  loaded on the SGI computer for doing the 3-D image analysis. A network  printer will be hooked by ethernet link to both computers so that  digitalized images can be printed for publication and for preparation  of slides.    The instrument will be administered by a committee  consisting of the  P.I. and the major users. Dr. Terry Viancour who has extensive  experience with enhanced video microscopy and image analysis has agreed  to be the faculty supervisor responsible for insuring that all users  are trained in the proper operation of the instrument. The instrument  will be a part of the Biological Sciences Electron Microscope facility.  This facility is staffed by a full time research associate, Mr. Phillip  Rutledge. The Department of Biological Sciences will commit 10% of Mr.  Rutledge's time to overseeing the day to day operation of the laser  scanning confocal Microscope. The microscope will be made available for  use by all members of the University community, including post-doctoral  fellows, graduate and undergraduate students. While primarily a  research instrument, its use will be incorporated into an advanced  course on microscopy and into the research projects of the graduate and  undergraduate programs thus providing increased student exposure to  this powerful technology.    In recognition of the central role that research plays in the teaching  mission of the University and the importance of exposure of students in  the biomedical/bioengineering sciences to \"state of the art\" technology  the University of Maryland Baltimore County has committed matching  funds to aid in the purchase of this equipment should the grant be  funded.",
