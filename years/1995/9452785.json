 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    9452785  Barstow    This project is to understand the potential for implementing instructional materials using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to change the way students and teachers in grades 6-12 engage in scientific investigations.  The basic concepts of GIS are introduced in the context of mapping the local environment around the school. The knowledge learned is extended and applied in two additional units which explore an area of science or technology of local interest such as pipes and wires or a plant survey.  The students are not only doing data analysis, but exploring their environment, collecting their own observations, and using the power of technology to make connections among the natural and built environments of their locality.  The materials emphasize development of thinking skills, problem-solving, data analysis, and visualization.  Students should learn how one element of the city affects the others and develop a sense of personal connection to the city.  As the activities focus on urban resources the \"economically disadvantaged\" students become \"scientifically advantaged\" learners since cities are generally rich in GIS resources.  Major corporations and government agencies in the Boston area have agreed to collaborate.  A resource guide for GIS urban education which includes the introductory material, software guidelines, suggestions for data sources, and other recommendations is to be developed and distributed nationally.  The project is well-documented and the materials are tested in a locality outside of Boston.",
