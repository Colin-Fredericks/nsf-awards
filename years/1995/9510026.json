 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510026  Rice      The Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Oregon  will upgrade their present Cameca SX-50 electron probe  microanalyzer (EPMA). This instrument forms the core of their  analytical facilities and is crucial for research currently being  conducted by nearly half of their department.  The upgrade will  include the purchase of a SUN SPARCstation 5 as part as part of a  \"SXPACK\" upgrade offered though Cameca, image processing software  and two x-ray diffracting pseudocrystals used for the precise  analysis of light elements.  The SUN computer will replace a DEC  PDP-11 minicomputer that is at the end of its useful life, and  more importantly is no longer supported in terms of software  development.  Without this upgrade, the PI's scientific  creativity and productivity would be severely limited by an  antiquated computer system.  Additionallly, the SUN-based  computer system will provide a modern computing platform that is  fully compatible with existing machines on their network and will  enable access to recently developed software packages designed to  fully utilize the capabilities of the SX-50.  Recent advances in  pseudocrystal technology and analytical techniques have resulted  in the capability of analyzing elements in the range from boron  to oxygen with precision and accuracy approaching that commonly  associated with heavier elements. Ongoing and planned research  projects require relatively precise analyses of oxygen and boron  in a variety of bulk compositions.    ***",
