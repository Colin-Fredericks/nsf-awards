 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9506077  Meneveau  Johns Hopkins University    The Department of Mechanical Engineering at The Johns Hopkins University will purchase a high performance computing, communications and visualization system which will be dedicated to research on complex fluid-thermal processes.  The equipment requested consists of a high-speed computer and one graphics workstation for 3-D visualization and animation, linked together and connected to laboratories by a high-speed fiber network.  This equipment will (I) allow processing of extensive mulit-dimensional laboratory data, (ii) provide computing power necessary to perform large-scale numerical simulations, and (iii) compare and integrate large computational and experimental data sets.  This will have a significant impact on the following projects: (a) Analysis of small-scale models for large-eddy simulation of turbulent flow, where massive experimental data sets are analyzed to study unsolved problems in the modeling of subgrid-scales.  (b) Study of generation mechanisms of small bubbles, where a new method of producing tiny bubbles at high rates is investigated experimentally and theoretically.  (c) Thermoacoustic refrigeration, where heat flow is driven by acoustic energy.  This study - experimental, computational, and analytical - addresses the factors limiting the efficiency of present systems.",
