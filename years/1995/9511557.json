 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511557  Jakubson    Daughters of mothers who were welfare recipients are, other  things equal, more likely to be welfare recipients themselves.   In order for policy to address the issue of welfare transmission,  policy-makers need to know more than the fact that there is an  intergenerational link in welfare dependency.  The nature of the   transmission mechanism has important implications for which types  of policy interventions will be effective.  This project will  partition the intergenerational correlation into components  attributable to unobserved heterogeneity, associated with the  transmission of preferences and/or constraints (which would be  present in the absence of parental welfare participation), and  state dependence, or  scarring  (which is directly attributable  to parental welfare participation).  Data from the Panel Study of  Income Dynamics (PSID) will be used to investigate these  questions.      Two different statistical models are developed and tested using  the PSID.  One is based on a sequential choice approach in which   the welfare participation decision is conditional on the  fertility decision.  The other allows for concurrent choice among  fertility and welfare status.  Within each model two approaches  to distinguish the heterogeneity and state dependence components   are used.  One approach allows for both family- and individual-  specific heterogeneity components and relies on a timing  assumption for the decomposition.  In the other, the two  components can be identified without a timing assumption, but at   the cost of allowing for only a family-specific effect.",
