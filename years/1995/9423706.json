 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops new methods of statistical inference for  data measured   with error. The methods exploit the availability of high-speed  computing to   simulate the effects of measurement error on a data set. The  results of such   simulation experiments form the basis of a method of inference  called   simulation extrapolation. The first component of the research  adapts the method   of simulation extrapolation estimation to situations in which  replicate   measurements are made on the variables measured with error. The  second   component of the research uses the complex-variable formulation  of simulation   extrapolation to bypass the extrapolation step. This is  accomplished by   performing a simulation experiment using complex pseudo random  variables to   compute unbiased estimating equations for the parameters of  interest. The third   component of the research focuses on two-sample hypothesis  testing problems,   developing tests that are asymptotically valid when data from one  sample are   measured with error.     The presence of measurement error in data can affect the validity  of   conclusions drawn from statistical analyses of such data. For  example,   measurement error in risk factors such as blood pressure or  cholesterol level   affects statistical determination of the relationship of heart  disease to such   risk factors, usually resulting in underestimation of the  beneficial effects of   controlling these risk factors. Similarly, statistical  determination of the   relationship of ecosystem health to ecosystem stressers  (pollutants, for   example) can be obscured by the inability to accurately measure  stresser   levels. This research develops statistical theory and methods for  making valid   inferences from data that are measured with error. The fact that  errors of   measurement occur in many areas of science (survey methodology,  environmental   studies, epidemiology, medicine for example) means that the  research is widely   applicable. The research uses novel  computer simulation methods  to simulate the   effects of measurement error on a data set and on the conclusions  drawn from   such data. The information obtained from the simulation studies  is then used to   make valid inferences from the data that are free from the  biasing effects of   measurement error.",
