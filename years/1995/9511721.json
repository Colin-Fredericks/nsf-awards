 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511721  DeWeerth    Humans and animals move around in their environments with seeming  ease.  To design better robotic devices, engineers would like  to  capture  the  design  principles that animals  use.  This  in  an  interdisciplinary project between engineers, computer  scientists  and  biologist directed at gaining a better understanding of  the  ways  animals  control movement, by studying the  neural  systems  that  generate swimming motion in fish and other simple  animals.  This research will consist both of studying the nervous system of  the particular animals and of modeling the behaviors generated by  these  systems. The circuits in the nervous systems  that  create  the  observed  patterns  of movement, even  in  these  relatively  simple animals are very complex. Therefore, the research of these  investigators  will  focus  on the  design  of  very  large-scale  integrated  (VLSI)  circuits that emulate  the  function  of  the  biology. These complex artificial circuits make it much easier to  create  neuron firing patterns in real time that are very similar  to  those found in their biological counterparts. The end goal of  this research is to develop a better understanding of the biology  while  learning  how  to  better engineer  systems  that  perform  complex tasks that can currently only be performed by humans  and  other animals.",
