The researchers aim to determine  various material properties of the earth, such as slowness  and impedance, by using given sets of seismic data.  Seismic  inversion requires the solution of two optimization  problems: one highly non-linear and moderately large, and  another nearly quadratic and very large.  A new optimization  method, tailored to solve these optimization problems, will  be developed and tested on 2-dimensional seismic models.    Determining the properties of the earth from seismic surface  data is of great practical importance.  The main obstacle to  the solution of the problem at present is the excessive  computing time required by current optimization techniques.  One of the goals of this study is to develop new techniques  that will speed up the inversion process in a fully  automatic manner.  The current project is enhanced by the  complementarity of the collaborators' expertise.  Dr.  Nocedal's main research has focused on the development of  new optimization algorithms capable of rapidly solving very  large problems, such as those arising in seismic inversion,  while Dr. Gomez has experience developing new methods for  global and non-differentiable optimization problems.  ***",
