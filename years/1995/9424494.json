A series of experimental studies of protists in aquatic microcosms are designed to test predictions about how diversity within populations, communities and ecosystems affects responses to changing physical environments.  First, experimental manipulations of both species richness and temperature will test whether changing physical conditions affect community structure and ecosystem processes, and whether initial biodiversity affects the responses seen.  Second, manipulations of the presence of density-dependent competition and predation will whether recent models of interspecific interactions in changing environments accurately predict different responses of species to gradual increases in temperature.  Third, manipulations of the presence or absence of population growth and rates of temperature change will test whether the ability to adapt in response to rapidly changing environments depends on rates of environmental change, and whether rates of adaptation differ between populations.  This problem addresses the interplay between population components of biodiversity and population processes in changing environment.   The conservation and restoration of communities and ecosystems re quires basic information about functional links between populations, communities and ecosystems.  An important parallel thrust is the rigorous identification of linkages between population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem function.  Such linkages can only be made in systems where these processes can be measured and explored.  Rather than focus on a single level of ecological organization, novel insights will be gained from these studies that will integrate across the hierarchical levels of population, community and ecosystem ecology.  This level of integration is particularly tract able in microbial communities established in experimental microcosms, where various aspects of biodiversity and changing environments can be readily controlled and manipulated.",
