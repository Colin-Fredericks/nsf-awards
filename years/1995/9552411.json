 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides the Computer Science Department with the  funds to equip laboratory rooms with modern computing equipment  essential for carrying out experiments and exercises in computer  science.   The Department has implemented an innovative set of  laboratory courses that span the undergraduate curriculum.   The  cornerstone of this set of laboratory courses is a unique,  breadth-first sequence of four courses required of all majors,  minors, and preservice teachers of computer science, entitled CS  I-IV.   This sequence incorporateq all of the traditional lower-  division topics in advanced programming, data structures,  algorithms, and discrete math--along with a strong ethics  component and introductions to the major subject areas of  computer science (artificial intelligence, compilers, networks,  operating systems, and so forth)--into a seamless presentation.    The laboratory sections accompanying CS I-IV allow students to  explore and experiment with these topics in weekly 2-hour  meetings.   An innovative program animation system (DYNALAB) has  been developed locally with NSF funds in support of these labs;  algorithm and concept animators from other sources are also being  incorporated.   Students in upper-division undergraduate  laboratory courses use professional software and hardware tools  for their experiments.",
