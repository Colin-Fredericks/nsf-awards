 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550712  O'Shea  The Ti02 catalyzed photodegradation of the organophosphorus  compounds will be carefully monitored and evaluated to determine  the kinetic parameters for the process.  These kinetic parameters  are of importance in evaluating and predicting overall rates and  efficiencies for the degradation of organophosphorus compounds in  multi-component systems and for reactor design.  The mass balance  between the initial substrates and the products formed during these  reactions will be used to determine the degree of mineralization.   Characterization of the reaction intermediates and products formed  throughout the course of the degradation will be used to establish  the course of the reactions.  Hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion,  and hydrogen peroxide are formed during the photocatalytic process,  each species will be independently generated and the product  distribution upon reaction with the simulants determined.  The  characteristic product distributions for hydroxyl radical,  superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide will be compared to those  observed for the Ti02 catalyzed photo-reactions to establish the  role and involvement of these intermediates in the Ti02 catalyzed  photodegradation.  Since the solutions pH, dissolved oxygen  concentration, and reaction byproducts can dramatically effect the  degradation process, these factors will be thoroughly investigated.   The use of additives to accelerate the process will also be  evaluated.  These studies will provide a fundamental understanding  of the factors governing the chemical reactivity of  organophosphorus compounds on photoexcited TiO2.  The information  obtained from the proposed investigations will find direct  application in the optimization and evaluation of semiconductor  catalyzed photooxidation as a means of detoxification of  environmentally threatening organophosphorus compounds, such as  chemical warfare agents and pesticides.    If supported this project will have a substantial impact on the  fundamental understa nding of the processes involved in TiO2  photocatalysis and the professional development of several  minorities into the chemical and environmental sciences.  One  minority faculty member, 4-5 undergraduate students (three which  currently plan to pursue a Ph.D. in Chemistry upon completion of  their BS degrees) and 2 masters students will be directly involved  in the proposed project.  Support will increases minority  participation in the PIs' laboratories by 50%.  ***",
