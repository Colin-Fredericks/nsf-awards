Thomas Ratchford,  Director, Center for Science, Trade, and Technology Policy,  George Mason University, to conduct with Dr. Dr. Young Gul Kim,  Director, Research Center for Catalytic Technology, Pohang  University of Science and Technology, Korea, the Second U.S.-  Korea Joint Seminar on Science and Technology Policy.  This joint  seminar will be held in two sessions, the first, in December  1995, at George Mason University, the second, in the spring of  1996, in Daeduk Science Town, Korea.  Eight U.S. scientists from  outside the Washington area will be supported for the first  session, while 12 U.S. participants will be supported for the  second session, in Korea.  The joint seminar will have three  major foci, namely: R&D strategies of industries; the promotion  of basic research in universities; and increasing U.S.-Korea S&T  cooperation.    The December 1995 session will be timed to immediately precede  the Third U.S.-Korea Science and Technology Forum, a major annual  event held in Washington, D.C., and financed by the Korean  Ministry of Science and Technology.  This timing should attract,  at little additional cost, a number of concerned U.S. and Korean  specialists who will participate in the Forum.  The second  session of the joint seminar will be made to coincide with the  time period (probably March 1996) in which representatives of  U.S. companies will be attending a joint meeting of the  Industrial Research Institute (IRI) and its Korean counterpart,  the Korea Industrial Technology Association (KITA).  U.S.  participants in the second session will tour major manufacturing  industries, industrial and government research laboratories, and  research universities, in order to provide them a first-hand  exposure to Korea's S&T activities.  The IRI Executive Director  is expected to participate in both sessions.    The collaborators are exceptionally well qualified to organize  and conduct such a joint seminar.  The pa rticipants supported by  this award are recognized experts whose presentations will be of  mutual interest and benefit.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which  seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and  Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual interest and benefit.  Korean  participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).",
