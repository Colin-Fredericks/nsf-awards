 "awd_abstract_narration": "An innovative technique for strengthening and retrofitting steel  girders in composite steel concrete bridges by epoxy bonding carbon  fiber tape/plate to the girder tension flange is presented.  The  feasibility of this technique will be established via experimental  and analytical modeling of coupon specimens.  Development of a  project to study full-scale composite specimens which utilize this  innovative technique will follow.  The research is anticipated to  result in new knowledge, add to the data base for integrating  advanced modern materials into Civil Engineering structures, and  help bridge design engineers extend the service life of existing  bridges.  The knowledge learned will guide a durability study of  steel girder bridges with carbon composite laminates.    The interactive activities are designed to provide greater  visibility of women engineers on campus and thus to encourage  female students to pursue a career in engineering.  They include:   teaching a sophomore level course and senior/graduate level course;  organizing a seminar series enhancing the visibility of women who  hold academic, industry, or government, positions within various  specialties of Civil Engineering; and assisting SWE members in  organizing an engineering activity during National Engineers Week  to enhance visibility of female engineering students to high school  and/or grammar school students.",
