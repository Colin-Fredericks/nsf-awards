 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421362         The Bantu languages of Africa have played a major role in the  development of current phonological theory. One reason for the  continued importance of the phonology of Bantu languages is that de-  spite a basic similarity between the languages, the abstract building  blocks of grammars are arranged differently in each language, so that  every language poses new empirical puzzles. Bantu languages are  particularly rich in the area of prosodic phenomena tones, vowel  length and syllabification and often have highly developed systems of  prosodic rules that apply at the sentence level. While quality  descriptions of the phonology of perhaps a dozen Bantu languages are  available, there are around 400 Bantu languages spoken in Africa, so  one can accurately say that the surface has only been scratched in  studying the phonology of Bantu languages.       The goal of this three-year project is to provide a more solid  empirical foundation for the study of the grammatical structure of  Bantu languages, focusing on problems in the phonology of certain  languages spoken in Southern Kenya, Northern Tanzania and Southern  Uganda. Four languages are targeted for extensive investigation in  this project, specifically Kikerewe, Runyankore, Bukusu and Kikamba.  None of these languages has received adequate attention in terms of  their phonological systems, especially in terms of tone and syllable  structure.        Working with native speakers of these languages, the research  team will elicit lexical items and grammatical paradigms, including  inflectional paradigms and phrasal constructions, to determine the  range of phonological alternations attested in these languages.  Simultaneously these data will be analyzed; hypotheses will be formed  regarding the principles which explain the distribution of the  available data. By collecting and analyzing the data simultaneously,  errors and omissions in the data will be detected quickly and  hypotheses can be tested against a wider range of const ructions. The  data and analyses generated by this project will then be disseminated  as a special issue of the Ohio State University Working Papers in  Linguistics, and through journal articles and monograph-length  publications.",
