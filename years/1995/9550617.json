 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Meadowcreek Science Institute is a four week residential  science program for minority students from throughout Arkansas who  are entering the seventh, eight or ninth grades.  A total of 50  different students who have an interest or aptitude in science,  engineering or mathematics (SEM) will participate in each year of  the three year program.  The primary goal of this initiative is to  encourage underrepresented minority students from Arkansas to  pursue secondary and university level studies and subsequent  careers in science, engineering and mathematics.  Students will  explore energy, physics, mathematics, chemistry. geology.  hydrology, biology, ecology, horticulture and environmental science  thrmugh active participation in a diverse natural setting.    Students will take part in scientific, hands-on, and interactive  activities while in residence at Meadowcreek's 1500 acre outdoor  classroom which includes an 18,000 square foot solar powered  education center.  Students will experience the excitement of  scientific discovery as they study biology by the side of a stream  or sample beneficial insects as part of a mathematics activity.   The program is designed to make the sciences relevant while  developing communication skills and cooperative approaches to  problem solving.    The Meadowcreek Science Institute will inspire students to reach  beyond self-imposed limitations through interactions with teaching  assistants, mentors and other role models.  Field trips will enable  students to see science in action, while exposing students to  professionals in a variety of scientific fields.  The program  collaborates with the Arkansas Statewide Systemic Initiative,  Arkansas Science Crusade, Arkansas STRIVE, Teachers of Tomorrow and  the Arkansas Educational Cooperatives.  Student progress will be  carefully tracked and mentors will maintain contact and continuity  with students throughout the year.  A program advisory committee  will monitor the entire program as well as follow-up and ev aluation  activities.  ***",
