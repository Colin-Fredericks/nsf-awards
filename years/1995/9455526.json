 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455526  Cooper                               Most traditional organic chemistry laboratories tend to be of the  cookbook type. That is students learn laboratory techniques and  then use them to synthesize a given compound in a prescribed manner  with a recipe. There is growing unease within the chemical  education community about the pedagogical value of such  laboratories. The organic laboratory course proposed here will  build on the strengths of our general chemistry laboratory courses.  Students will work in groups on open ended projects instead of one  lab period exercises. Instead of learning a technique as an end in  itself, techniques will be learned as a means to an end. Over the  course of the semester, students will apply their problem solving  skills to projects approximating the research process as closely as  possible. The students will also use both their written and oral  communication skills to plan, critique, and evaluate their  experiments.  A number of resource materials will be developed including a  multimedia program that incorporates video and text so that  students can access information in the laboratory, and a laboratory  manual that will contain a database of typical experimental  conditions and work-up procedures in addition to descriptions of  techniques. This new lab format will have a significant impact on  how our students learn organic chemistry and will be particularly  beneficial to women.  The principal value of this project lies in its application to ALL  organic students, in the expected improved performance and higher  retention rates for women and in its adaptability to other  situations.",
