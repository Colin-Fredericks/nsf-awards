 "awd_abstract_narration": "Survey instruments, ranging from those designed to elicit contingent valuations to those that collect attitudes and opinions about policy options, are used as information sources to determine environmental policy and program actions. However, the current survey methods do not accurately represent the multidimensional and nonmonetary nature of the resource values that must be considered in the policy process. Therefore, this project develops a research program on two promising new environmental survey approaches, which appear to offer distinct advantages in providing comprehensive and focused databases on public responses to the issues and concerns policy makers are expected to address. The decision pathways approach asks respondents a series of interrelated questions, each of which has several answers. The choice of answers creates a decision path for each respondent, which in turn reveals the preferred resource management options and the reasoning strategies. The value integration approach begins by identifying the components of value relevant to the issue and assists respondents in using this knowledge to make informed tradeoffs across alternative environmental policies. Both proposed survey approaches reflect the insights of behavioral decision theory and recognize the constructive nature of complex environmental values.  This project is supported by the EPA/NSF Valuation for Environmental Policy funding opportunity.",
