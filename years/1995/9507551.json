ISHMT is the nodal agency in  India for stimulating research in this area of  thermal sciences.  Heat and mass transfer play  a very important role in manufacturing  industries and in industrial processes.   Understanding of the phenomena that underlie  industrial processes is essential for the  optimal design of equipment, components, and  efficiency of processes.  The objectives of the  conference are to promote the exchange of  technical information in this rapidly evolving  field, to identify areas of cooperation between  industry and research institutions, and to  further enhance the existing level of US-Indo  collaborations.  Participants will have the  opportunity to discuss the state-of-the-art in  areas of prime interest in both countries and  to visit India's leading research centers such  as the IITs, the Indian Institute of Science  and the  National Aeronautical Laboratory,  Bangalore.       Scope:  Thermal sciences are expected to play  an important role in the development of  national critical technologies in the next  decade.  In addition to the national effort,  there is considerable effort to  internationalize research and technology  development in thermal sciences, particularly  in the area of heat and mass transfer.  India  is one of the leading countries in Asia that  conduct significant research in heat and mass  transfer.  The conference is organized to allow  for dialogue among potential collaborators and  the development of focused research proposals.    US-Indo collaboration is currently well below  its potential considering the level of activity  in the field in each country. ***",
