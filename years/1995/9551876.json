 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this grant, a comprehensive curriculum development  project integrates critical thinking and problem-solving skills  into existing curriculum.   The need for such a project springs  from a lack of experiences with abstract concepts that many black  students bring to the classroom.   The new teaching methodology  utilizes a variety of multimedia computer-enhanced learning tools  that will unify and focus all science courses into a cohesive  unit.   Concept bridges are being built as the student's ability  to interpret, analyze, and visualize concepts in science is  developed as a result of a variety of guided experiences.    Developed strategies integrate effective communication, critical  thinking, and problem-solving skills.   The integration of these  skills focuses attention on the development of higher level  thinking skills and provides students with a more valuable  science education.   Moreover, this experience can lead to  increased retention, student enrollment, student confidence, and  mastery of course content.   The new equipment alone cannot make  a significant impact on student entry into science careers nor  guarantee a rewarding science experience.   However, by careful  integration of these tools into the existing curriculum, a  delicate balance is achieved among the teacher, student, and  computer multimedia support system.   This balance can produce a  student with a far deeper understanding and appreciation of  science.",
