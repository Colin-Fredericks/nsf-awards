The objectives of the Workshop are: 1) to bring  together specialists from both countries in the development  of HTS; 2) to visit R&D laboratories to gain an  understanding of the level of equipment and personnel  support in HTS; and 3) identify the problem areas that are  particularly suited for international cooperative programs  to further the progress of HTS. The workshop will be held at  the National Research Institute on Metals in Tsukaba, Japan  on October 23-24th. The technical tour consists of three  visits to key research centers/labs during October 25-27th.  This is the second Workshop in Japan. The previous one was  held in Houston.  %%%  This workshop is organized to address research issues that  will advance progress in five technical areas related to  national needs:  1. tapes and coils, and their applications;  2. bulk materials and applications; 3.  thin-films and new  materials; 4.  vortex structure and critical currents; 5.  theory and characterization.",
