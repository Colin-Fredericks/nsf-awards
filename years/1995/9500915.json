 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500915 Mizel   This is a proposal for a research project in  mathematics. Part I of this proposal involves work on the  foundations of the calculus of variations and control theory.  Part II involves work on simplified models for materials  possessing higher order and nontrivial microstructure, as well as  work involving control problems for matterials which are in the  liquid crystal state. In each part, the proposed research  represents, in part, a further development of previously  accomplished work, and , in part, the introduction of new  research topics.  In part I, renewed interest in a gap phenomenon  discovered by Lavrentiev in 1926 has come about because of the  potential implications for nonlinear elasticity and related  subjects. The recently gained insights into this phenomenon in  first order one-dimensional Lagrange problems are now being  supplemented by the study of higher order problems in  one-dimension, by the study of first order problems in higher  dimensions, and by the study of isoperimetrically constrained  problems in higher dimensions. In part II, a homogenization  method for examining a simplified model of a second order  nonlinear material leads to a characterization and minimization  problem involving Young measures which is currently being  investigated, and a study of the implications of polyconvexity  for initation of fracture in isotropic materials is under way..",
