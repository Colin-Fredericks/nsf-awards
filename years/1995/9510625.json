Semiconductor manufacturing processes are typically monitored   using statistical process control (SPC) techniques, and  adjustments are made in operating setpoints only when out-of-  control conditions are detected.  This approach cannot  effectively compensate for systematic parameter variations such  as drifts in the process operating environment, material  properties, or equipment conditions.  Consequently, methods for  adjusting the process operating point from run to run are needed  to improve the quality and yield of semiconductor manufacturing  processes when it is too costly or physically impossible to  eliminate systematic variations.    This project will combine techniques developed for system  identification, parameter estimation, and feedback control, with  methods for statistical and physical modeling to perform  effective run-to-run control for key processes in a commercial  photovoltaic cell manufacturing facility.  Parameterized models  will be developed to characterized the input-output relations for  each process, and so-called gray-box parameter estimation, Kalman  filtering, and constrained optimization will be applied to update  the process setpoints for each process run based on post-process  measurements from previous runs.  A primary emphasis of this work  will be to develop methods for incorporating process knowledge  from physical models and empirical data into the on-line  computations to more effectively compensate for the process  variations.  The key trade-off to be explored is the complexity  of the models versus the efficiency and effectiveness of the on-  line parameter estimation and control computations.    In addition to these immediate technical objectives, this one-  year project sponsored  under the NSF GOALI program will enable  the principal investigator, who is currently working in the area  of semiconductor process control, to gain valuable experience  working with industrial scientists and engineers in a commercial  semiconductor manufacturing facility.  The research will be  conducted at - and supported in part by - EBARA Solar, Inc.   Models will be obtained using process data from EBARA, and the  run-to-run feedback control techniques will be implemented on  actual production equipment to evaluate their effectiveness.   This experience will contribute significantly to the definition  of future theoretical and applied research directions in model-  based control of complex manufacturing processes.  ***",
