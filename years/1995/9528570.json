 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528570  Slattery      This research project will utilize analytical chemical  techniques to evaluate the importance of secondary  metabolites and steroids in the reproduction of 3 species of  soft corals from Guam.  This project builds on ongoing  research which has identified and examined the importance of  secondary metabolites, organic extracts, and morphological  defenses in soft coral predator deterrence.  This project  will extract, isolate, and determine the structures of new  secondary metabolites in adult colonies and their eggs.  Temporal changes in concentrations of these compounds will  be correlated with reproductive indices to assess the role  of the compounds in maturation and spawning.  Standard  bioassays will be conducted to guide isolation of bioactive  compounds and to determine the importance of isolated  natural products in egg release, sperm chemotaxis, and  feeding deterrence.  Novel compounds identified in this  project will expand upon a growing database of metabolites  that can be used as chemotaxonomic markers and will be  incorporated into existing pharmacological programs.  Additionally, this project will contribute significant in  sights into the reproductive biology and chemical ecology of  the common soft corrals on the shallow reefs surrounding  Guam.  ***",
