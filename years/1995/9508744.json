 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9508744  KAUFFMAN  In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, John   Kauffman of the University of Missouri, Columbia will use subpicosecond   spectroscopic techniques to measure the Rotational Correlation Times of   anthracene and stilbene probe molecules in a variety of pure and mixed   supercritical fluids (SCF), including carbon dioxide, ethane, and carbon   dioxide-ethanol mixtures.  These investigations will provide valuable   information concerning the solvation characteristics of the fluids.  A   second series of experiments will use an anthracene-dimethylaniline   exciplex as a model system for reaction studies in supercritical fluids.    Information from these studies will be used to test current theories of   SCF solvation and clustering, determine the effects of solvent density,   viscosity, polarity and inhomogeneities on solvation, and provide insight   on the chemical reactivities in supercritical fluids.    Supercritical Fluid carbon dioxide has tremendous potential as an   environmentally benign solvent in which to perform chemical processes   such as extractions and synthesis.  In order to make use of this   potential, a microscopic understanding of the solvent environment around   a solute molecule and the influence of this solvation on chemical   reactivities.  Professor Kauffman's research will provide detailed   information on both these topics and will test current theoretical models   of supercritical fluid solvation.  ***",
