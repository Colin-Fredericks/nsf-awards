 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in biophysics between Scott C. Hartsel of the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire, and Jacques Bolard of the Laboratory for Biomolecular Physics and Chemistry at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris.  The objective of their research is to study the mechanism(s) of action of model ion channels in a group of antibiotics called polyene macrolides. This group includes the clinically important Amphotericin B, a new and less well understood group of polyenes.  The project addresses the unknown structure-function relationship of transmembrane ion channel in Amphotericin B and the role of cell membranes.  The project will advance understanding on the role of  solubility, self association, cellular response and length of  the molecule in the mechanism of channel formation.  The U.S. investigator, who is located at an undergraduate institution, brings to this collaboration expertise in biophysical studies.  This is complemented by French expertise in model membrane systems and special instruments for ion measurements at the French laboratory.  The international collaboration will broaden the research experience of the investigator and his undergraduate students who will benefit from the visits of a leading French researcher.",
