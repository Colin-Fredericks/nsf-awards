 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students majoring in the life sciences are taking part in a new  curriculum that is organized around a series of investigative  laboratory modules.   The program now extends over the five  quarters of the freshman and sophomore years, has greatly  decreased emphasis on lectures, features extensive use of  computers and technology, and involves integration with other  disciplines.   Students work in small groups and model, plan,  carry out, and report on their experiments.   These same concepts  are being extended into upper-division and nonmajors courses.    The new approach has brought into sharp focus the need for new  analytical techniques that will extend the number of biological  principles that students may prove for themselves.   The  techniques should be quantitative, easily mastered, and linked to  the cmmputer for data analysis, ready comparison with national  data bases, report writing, and research presentations.   This  project funds a platform of four techniques for collecting images  in digital form for analysis and quantitation on a laboratory  network of Macintosh computers.   The four are a flatbed scanner  (to digitize graphic data), a Hi-8 camcorder (to capture macro  images, time lapse, and fast frame), monochrome video cameras (to  capture medium light intensity macro to micro scale images), and  a sensitive CCD color video camera (primarily for microscope  work).   Appropriate accessories and data storage devices also  are obtained under this project.",
