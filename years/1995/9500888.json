 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9500888  Wudl    The objective of this research is to continue the development of  molecules which are designed to be molecular precursors to organic  metals and high-temperature organic superconductors. Three  approaches will be pursued: (a) synthesis of new methanofullerenes  consisting of variously substituted C61 and C66, (b) preparation of  new materials based on periconjugative effects of methanofullerenes  C61-C66 with electron rich and super-electron rich olefins as well  as alkali metals, and (c) preparation of new materials based on new  electron donor methanofullerenes. Once prepared, the physical  properties of solids will determined using the latest developments  in experimental condensed matter physics, in collaboration with  other groups. %%%  It is a rare event in the history of science when a new starting  material is uncovered for chemical transformations and the eventual  development of exotic compounds and novel materials. That is the  case with the discovery of buckminsterfullerene (C60 ) and the  fullerenes. The family of spherical and oblong molecular allotropes  of carbon, the fullerenes are formed at temperatures upward of  2000 C, yet the smaller, isolable and characterizable members of a  large family are reactive molecules at room temperature. Because C60  (and C70) is a relatively strong electron acceptor, it is of  interest to explore its reactions with a number of diazomethanes.  This research has led to the discovery of methanofullerenes and  fulleroids, functionalized fullerenes. The proposed work is the  continuation of prior studies in the same area. Ultimately, these  and other related new compounds may be utilized for the fabrication  of novel molecular metals and superconductors.",
