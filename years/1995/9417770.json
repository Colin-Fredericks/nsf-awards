 "awd_abstract_narration": "The capsid of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV 1) is an icosahedral (T=16) protein shell 15nm thick and 125nm in diameter. In the intact virus, the capsid contains the viral DNA and it is surrounded by a lipid membrane. The capsid is composed of a major protein species called VP5 which accounts for approximately 70% of the total capsid mass plus three minor polypeptides, VP19, VP23 and VP26. In infected cells, empty (DNA free) capsids are assembled in the cell nucleus and later packaged with DNA. The P.I. has recently developed a system in which the HSV 1 capsid can be assembled in a cell free environment. The system requires the use of six different recombinant baculoviruses each coding for one of the six proteins involved in HSV 1 capsid formation. The six are the four structural polypeptides mentioned above plus the scaffolding protein (VP22a) and the maturational protease (the product of the HSV 1 UL26 gene). Each virus is used to infect a separate culture of insect (Sf9) cells and cell free extracts are prepared from each culture. HSV 1 capsids form spontaneously when the six extra cts are mixed. The P.I. plans to study the time course of capsid formation in this system to identify morphogenetic intermediates in the assembly process. It is expected that the structure and composition of such intermediates and the times they appear in reaction mixtures will suggest the basic features of the overall assembly pathway.   %%%   Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV l) is the causative agent of cold sores and fever blisters. The infectious virus consists of a protein shell called the capsid surrounded by a lipid membrane. HSV l contains DNA which is found inside the capsid shell. When the virus is replicated in an infected cell, a complete, empty capsid is first formed; it  is later packaged with DNA and finally coated with a membrane envelope. The goal of this project is to understand the first step in HSV l assembly, namely formation of the capsid. In these studies, the six proteins involved in capsid assembly are mixed together in vitro under conditions in which capsids form spontaneously. The P.I. proposes to use this system to identify intermediates in the assembly process. It is expected that the structure and protein composition of such intermediates and the times they appear will suggest the basic features of the overall assembly pathway.",
