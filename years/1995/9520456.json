The analysis and  computations required to ensure that the system will operate  within its reliability criteria are becoming increasingly  difficult and time consuming.  The resulting data is often hard  to interpret.  The goal of this research is to develop computer-  based expert systems to:  process data, identify patterns,  classify system conditions according to expected problems,  suggest scheduling or control changes, and control the system.   Artificial neural networks (ANN's) are useful for pattern  recognition and data classification.  Depending on the type of  network used, ANN's can be trained to give a desired output under  certain conditions, or they can be allowed to recognize patterns  in data without pre-defined output specifications.  An ANN  advisory system is proposed that will monitor system data,  process patterns and warn the operator of dangerous system  conditions.  Fuzzy logic systems formulate output decisions based  on sets of rules that apply within ranges of system conditions.   Thus they can efficiently deal with uncertain conditions and a  range of operating points.  The classification results of the  neural networks can be used to form a flexible, yet predictable  control system using fuzzy logic control.   The ANN/fuzzy logic  system will be designed to allow adjustments in response to  changing power system conditions.  ***",
