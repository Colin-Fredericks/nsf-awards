 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417304  Xu        Large scale atmospheric systems such as low and high pressure centers are  typically governed by a balance of  pressure gradient and coriolis forces and are,  therefore, termed  balanced  flow.  For small-scale phenomena such as  thunderstorms, this balance typically does not hold and these weather features are  referred to as being governed by  unbalanced  flows.  The Principal Investigator will  perform a numerical and theoretical study of these two flow types.          Density current features, squall lines and mesoscale vortices are important  mesoscale weather producing systems and often persist over timescales longer than  individual convective storms.  These long-lived mesoscale structures may involve  different types of interactions between the balanced large scale flows and more  transient small scale motions.  Studying the related balanced dynamics versus  unbalanced dynamics may lead to a new understanding of why the concerned structure  is long-lived.  The balanced (or unbalanced transient) flow component in a mesoscale  convective system is likely to be controlled deterministically (or stochastically) by the  large scale environmental flow.  Identifying the balanced and unbalanced flow  components in mesoscale convective systems may provide useful information for  improving or developing cloud parameterization schemes for numerical weather or  climate prediction models.    ***",
