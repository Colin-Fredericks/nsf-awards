Emerging  from this research is the idea that different components of  grammar interact to yield the best choice from a set of canidates.       This idea departs from more traditional approaches to the output of  linguistic levels in generative grammar, by which rules, principles  and constraints interact to determine the grammatical status of each  linguistic object independent of the status of possible competitors.         In the past year or two, interest in the linguistic role of  optimality has been sparked by the sharpened notions of \"economy\"  in Chomsky's Minimalist Program and by Prince and Smolensky's  Optimality Theory, originally developed for phonology. As work on  these notions has explored new analytic possibilities, many  questions have arisen. These include new versions of an old  debate between constraints on derivations and constraints on  representations, and entirely new questions about the nature of  the candidate set, in addition to complex and as yet imperfectly  formulated questions about learnability and computability.         These sorts of questions are coming to occupy a center stage  in current debate. Nonetheless, the questions have not been  systematically discussed, either in print or in a public  workshop. Therefore, a workshop addressing these issues will  convene at MIT May 19-21, 1995.  The explicit aim of the workshop  is to compare approaches and define questions for further  research. The discussion will be as focused as possible, in the  hope that genuine scientific progress can be made during the  three days of the conference.",
