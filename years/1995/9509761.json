 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509761  Kensley  The objectives of this project are to manage and maintain the  biological collections (and their associated systematic,  geographic and ecological data) generated through past and  current research activities in the World's polar regions, and to  facilitate the collections-based research activities of  systematic biologists studying the biota of the polar regions.   The collection will be curated and maintained according to  collection management standards.  Specimen-lots will be  identified with unique lot numbers and will be cataloged.  The  cataloged specimens will be accessioned and incorporated into the  department's permanent collections.  The specimen records will be  maintained in appropriate departmental computerized catalogs.   Sorting and identifications will be done as time and staff  expertise allow.  Collection related data will be maintained in  appropriate automated or paper-based files.  Computerized  specimen and station databases will continue to be developed and  maintained.  Work will continue on the development of automated  acquisition and loan databases.  All database development will  conform to departmental data standards and procedures.   Collection-based research activities will be facilitated through  the administration of a modest research grant program and through  the improved availability of collection-related data.  Station  data, polar type specimen data, and identified polar specimen  catalog records will be made available to the scientific  community through the Internet.  The project will insure the long  term care of the polar biological collections and their  associated data.  The specimens that comprise the polar  collections are an irreplaceable biological resource.  By  providing an historical community baseline, they serve a  fundamental role in documenting the current biodiversity of the  polar marine environment.  Their study provides significant  insights into the phylogenetics, evolution and systematics of all  of the major groups  of marine organisms.  Several hundred new  taxa have been described from the polar environment.  It is  reasonable to expect that many more undescribed taxa will be  discovered as researchers continue to study the polar specimens.",
