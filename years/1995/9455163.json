 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455163  This three-year project will extend an existing calculus  coalition to create a network of two year colleges and  comprehensive universities that will reform their calculus  curricula. The existing coalition in southeastern Texas will  expand in three stages to include institutions throughout the  South Central states. The extended coalition will grow from  intensive nine-day institutes and will be fostered by mentoring,  electronic mail, follow-through workshops, and a newsletter.    The coalition will use the materials and methods of the Calculus  for Comprehensive Universities and Two-Year Colleges (CUTYC)  Project, in which two-person faculty teams at Sam Houston State  University and North Harris, San Jacinto Central, and Tomball  Colleges have written student activities and customized  instructional methods from other calculus reform efforts. CUTYC  integrates cooperative learning, graphing technology, and writing  in a progression of problems and projects that challenge students  while improving their confidence and study skills.    The CUTYC faculty teams will serve as the senior personnel for  SC3. At each institute they will lead eight new teams who will  experience the CUTYC approach and plan for the ensuing year. The  CUTYC teams will mentor the new teams as they craft a curriculum  suited to the needs of their students and home institutions. The  new teams will conduct workshops for their colleagues to spread  the ideas and methods of the project to other faculty and other  courses. The coalition will directly involve 56 faculty leaders  at 28 collaborating institutions. The project will influence  numerous other faculty through on-site workshops, conference  presentations, and publications.    An advisory board will guide the project's progress, and the  project will employ an instructional consultant and an evaluator.  Evaluation will be used to refine the instructional approach, to  customize it to local site conditions, and to measure the success  of the project.",
