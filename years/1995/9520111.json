The  Couette-Taylor  problem is a prototype that has led to several advances in  understanding  the nonlinear dynamics and evolution of complexity in fluid  flows.  The subject is unique for the degree to which it brings together  mathematicians, experts in computational fluid dynamics,  physicists,  and engineers to discuss a wide variety of theoretical,  numerical, and  experimental techniques that may be first proven with this system  and later extended to more general problems. The meeting consists  of  a day of invited talks honoring the 65th year of physicist  Russell Donnelly,  followed by three days of contributed talks. A one-day  pre-conference  workshop will also be held with the intention of attracting  under-represented  groups and researchers from small institutions to a broader range  of  research topics in fluid instabilities, pattern formation, and  the  origins of turbulence.  %%%  An interdisciplinary meeting in proposed on the  mathematics and physics of fluid flow between rotating cylinders  and related fluid flow problems. This area of work has been  a prototype for several advances in the understanding of  instability and the onset of turbulence in fluid dynamics.  These advances include connections between chaotic dynamics and  turbulence, the spontaneous formation of patterns  in physical systems, the nonlinear dynamics of waves, and an  astonishing variety of ways that turbulence occurs. More than 100  mathematicians, computational experts, physicists, and engineers  are  expected to attend. Special features of the meeting include a  pre-conference workshop that is intended to enable  under-represented  groups to begin work in this field as well as a day of invited  talks  honoring the 65th year of the distingui shed physicist Russell  Donnelly.  ***",
