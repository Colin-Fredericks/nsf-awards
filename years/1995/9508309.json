The bulletin board will facilitate communication  between geologists and oceanographers doing research on  historical topics in the Earth sciences, with  historians of science. It will serve as a means of  communication between geographically-widespread  historical researchers on all the continents and  Australia.  In addition to assisting communication by  serving as a \"bulletin board\" for researchers to post  announcements of their particular research topics and  requests for collaboration or assistance, GeoClio will  provide space for listings of upcoming meetings,  conferences, and symposia with historical themes. It  may also contain summaries of recent historical  meetings and symposia, and possibly the table of  contents of publications in Earth history, to assist  beginning researchers in becoming more familiar with  the historical literature. GeoClio might also be used  as an \"electronic archive\" in which text of  historically- oriented research papers and journal  articles may be stored, if this use does not violate  appropriate copyright laws.  The university currently  operates a link with the Internet computer network  (whale.st.usm.edu) through the Academic Computing  Center of its College of Science & Technology, and this  computer server will connect with the existing link to  provide access to the Internet. The GeoClio computer  bulletin board will be accessible in text mode (via  Gopher) or in graphic mode, using the MOSAIC software  package of the National Center for Super computing  Activities to establish GeoClio as a site on the World-  Wide Web (WWW). By combining both text and graphics  access, GeoClio will be available both to users who  have only low-speed Internet access (in text mode), and  to users with high-speed computers able to acc ess WWW  \"home pages\" through MOSAIC.    ***",
