 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553411  Hare    This model is designed to investigate factors that affect the  awareness of girls and women about careers in science and math, and  to determine the effectiveness of hands-on activities and a  constructivist, cooperative approach to learning in increasing  interest in those careers.  The design is to increase participants'  knowledge of science and math, and to encourage girls and  women through role models, and through opportunities to build  community, to connect, and to construct their own learning.  The  design pays particular attention to the importance of science  and mathematics in the ways human beings live, and the ways in  which they treat the planet.   Field trips and hands-on experiences  are integrated with the content, and also provide opportunities to  talk, not only about content, but also issues of everyday life.   Project goals are:  (1) to increase the numbers of girls enrolling  in math and science courses at the middle and high school levels,  with a long-term goal of increasing the numbers of women who enter  careers in these areas; and (2) to make a difference in the  attitudes and agendas of teachers and parents, and of future  teachers and parents.      The model will provide opportunities for young women to see how  science and math applies to their lives, to use hands-on activities  with computers and to build awareness of the computer as  vital tool for learning and for access to knowledge, and to  participate in hands-on, learner-centered units in math and  science.  The design uses available research in learning styles,  multiple intelligences, and \"women's ways of knowing\" to present  content in ways conducive to motivating the young women and tapping  their strengths as learners.  Leaders are to work with teachers and  parents to build a support system to encourage the young women and  to strengthen their self-concepts.  The program is structured to  encourage practice of the arts of democracy, including  problem-solving, ethics, conflict resoluti on, prejudice reduction,  roles of the individual within the community, service leadership,  and celebration of diversity, as well as to increase communication  skills of participants.  ***",
