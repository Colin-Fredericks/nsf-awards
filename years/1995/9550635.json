 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eastern Michigan University (EMU) Summer Environment Camp will  address the critical Shortage of mathematicians, engineers, and  scientists the United States has experienced in recent years and  that is expected to worsen during the next two decades.  This  program will create opportunities for talented underrepresented  minority students in the seventh and eighth grade to obtain  mentoring and learning experiences that will encourage their  enrollment in mathematics and science courses at the secondary and  college levels.  The disciplinary focus is on the environment-  specifically, water, air and energy resources.    The camp consists of two phases: a four-and-a-half week residential  program and four Saturday Academies during the following school  year.  Fifty seventh-grade students from six public school systems  in southeast Michigan will plan and conduct research projects;  participate in explorations and field trips; ald discuss academic  and  career goals with university and pre-college faculty, graduate  and undergraduate students and minority mentors from business and  industry.  This project ia an interdisciplinary partnership of  EMU's science and mathematics faculty with student mentors,  industry leaders, government agencies, school systems and parents.  ***",
