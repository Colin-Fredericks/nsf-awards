 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will  be used in the construction and implementation of an  undulator-based x-ray beamline at the Advanced Photon  Source. The beamline, when completed, will include three  fully instrumented end stations optimized for grazing-  incidence x-ray scattering from surfaces/interfaces, high  resolution delta-Q-resolution x-ray scattering, and small-  angle x-ray scattering. This x-ray scattering facility will  be utilized by a consortium of scientists from U.  Pennsylvania, Princeton U., U. C. Santa Barbara, U.  Tennessee, Oak Ridge Natl. Lab., Brookhaven Natl. Lab., Los  Alamos Natl. Lab., and the Exxon Corp. Res. Lab., all of  whom are members of the \"Complex Materials Collaborative  Access Team\" (CMCAT). Among the groups studying complex  fluids there are 14 senior scientists, 8-10 postdoctorals,  and 9-12 graduate students. The complex fluids under study  by this group relate to self-assembled macromolecular  systems at interfaces and/or in bulk and include colloidal,  miscellar, polymer and biomolecular systems. Some of the  research topics being studied include: lipid and surfactant  mesophases; block copolymer melts and solutions;  surfactant/polymer association complexes; doped conjugated  polymers; fullerenes (\"buckyballs\"); ultrathin films and  biomolecular materials; heat proof proteins; multilayer  biomembrane ordered hydro-gels; protein-polymer  complexation; in-situ diffraction of flow and confinement  induced complex fluid structures; electrochemistry; liquid  surfaces.    Funds will be employed for the construction of an x-ray  beamline to be located at the Advanced Photon Source at  Argonne National Lab. which will feature three fully  equipped end stations. The beamline will be utilized by a  consortium of scientists from universities, government  laboratories, and an industrial laboratory for the study of  complex materials. Specific x-ray scattering studies will be  done on complex fluids, namely colloidal, micellar, polymer   and biomolecular systems.",
