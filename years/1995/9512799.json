The workshop will convene in  Darjeeling, India, November 1995 and will be hosted for its one  week duration by the North Bengal University and its affiliate,  St. Joseph's College.  The coordinators are Richard Pratt,  University of Pittsburgh and Swapan Sen Gupta, North Bengal  University.  Its subject is the interaction of energetic photons  with matter, as in such processes as photoabsorption, photon atom  scattering, bremsstrahlung and pair production.  Leaders from  Indian and US research communities will together examine the  opportunities provided by emerging technologies and identify new  directions for the research.      Scope:  The workshop is important considering the interest in  this subject that has been generated by the advent of a new  generation of synchrotrons.  The interaction of energetic photons  with matter is a modern field in which there is a long tradition  of research in both countries.  There is substantial experimental  work going on in India in this field and the basis for developing  cooperative research activities very strong.  Proceedings of the  workshop will be published.         ***                                                                         Pakistan and is the next step in developing a relationship  between scientists who are doing research in this field.  s area  of research.  ngoing relationship in the exchange of information  foin developing .  The International Conference on Non-  Accelerator Particle Physics will convene in Bangalore, India  from January 2-9, 1994.  Gaurang B. Yodh, University of  California, Irvine and R. Cowsik, Tata Institute of Fundamental  Research and Director, Indian Institute of Astrophysics,  Bangalore are the organizers.  This conference is dedicated to  the discussion of the fundamental physics that emerges from  diverse areas of non-acc elerator particle physics such as: Solar  Neutrino Astronomy, Cosmic Rays, Particle Physics, Neutrino  Physics and the Detection of Dark Matter.  Substantial progress  has been made in these fields during the past five years and it  is widely thought that definitive answers to several questions of  Physics beyond the Standard Model can now come from Non-  Accelerator methods of inquiry.  The conferees will review recent  developments in the various aspects of Particle Physics, their  implications in astrophysical situations, experimental detection  of dark matter, theoretical interpretation and empirical and  physical models of the large scale structure of the Universe.     Scope:  This conference will precede a major interdisciplinary  research program between the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and  the University of California, Irvine.  As considerable research  is going on in the US in all fields to be discussed at this  conference, it will be important for the US researchers to  present their work to an international body of some of the most   respected scientists from all over the world.    ***",
