 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522629  Yates  The Construction Decision Support System for Delay Analysis (DAS  - Delay Analysis System) for use on personal computers was  developed to integrate existing project control systems and  scheduling programs by adding the capability of determining  possible causes for delays and suggesting alternative courses of  action to prevent further delays.    The DAS was designed to demonstrate the importance of providing  an interactive environment for knowledge acquisition to improve  project controls and analysis processes.  The development of the  interactive system enhances information processing and decision-  making capabilities.  The ability to monitor the progress of a  project, and to determine possible causes of delays and suggest  corrective actions with the aid of a personal computer provides  consistent evaluation of project performance.    The objective of the second phase of the DAS research is to  include additional knowledge bases related to contract and  project parameters such as different types of projects, different  locations of projects, and different types of firms to increase  its usefulness to the diverse segments of the construction  industry.  The data collected will be analyzed using hypothesis  testing to determine whether there are correlations between the  different parameters and types of delays.  The results of this  analysis will be used to refine the DA system submodels.    Additional research objectives include conducting research in the  area of international delays, including cultural factors, and  creating new submodels that will contain knowledge on delays  related to international construction.  Research will also be  conducted in to resolution upon completion of construction  projects.  ***",
