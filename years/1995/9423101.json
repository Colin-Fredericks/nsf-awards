This project is funded jointly by NSF  and  NIST  to  provide  state-of-the-art cold neutron  scattering  instrumentation for the general scientific community.  CHRNS  instruments  are available to researchers from universities,  government, and industry. CHRNS consists of a 30 meter, high  resolution, Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) instrument  and  a  Spin Polarized Inelastic Neutron Scattering  (SPINS)  spectrometer.  With this award a new facility will be added:  a   Double  Crystal  Diffractometer  (DCD)  for  very   high  resolution SANS.  This will extend the upper size  limit  of  the  30  m SANS instrument to enable researchers to  examine  microstructural features from 1 nm to 10 micron.  This  will  provide a capability not available at any other neutron user  facility in the world.    The  SANS  instrument is expected to be  fully  utilized  by  researchers in condensed matter physics, chemistry,  biology  and  materials  science.   It will  enable  them  to  obtain  structural information on a scale ranging from 1  to  nearly  500  nanomicrometers on materials such  as  polymers,  metal  alloys,  ceramics, porous media structured fluids and  gels,  biological macromolecules and magnetic materials.   In  many  cases  such  measurements cannot be obtained  by  any  other  techniques.  %%%  These  instruments will provide state-of-the-art  capability  unequaled in this country, and will be competitive with  the  best facilities worldwide.  The instruments will be operated  in a user mode.  Proposal review and selection will be by an  external Program Advisory Committee, with proposal selection  being based on scientific merit of the projects proposed.  ***",
