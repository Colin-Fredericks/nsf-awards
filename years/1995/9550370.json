 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop new methods for  chromosome mapping in salmonid fishes including banding techniques  using SINE sequences for chromosome identification, species-  specific and chromosome-specific paint probes, and in situ  hybridization using cosmid clones for localization of genes.   Although there is an extensive linkage map for allozyme loci in  salmonids, no single copy genes have been mapped to specific  chromosomes.  Construction of chromosome maps would greatly benefit  fisheries research and enhance the usefulness of salamonid fishes  as models for research in developmental genetics, ecological  genetics, and toxicology.  Accurate maps will also allow us to  reconstruct chromosome evolution.  Work on development of these  methods will be done during my visit to University of Washington in  the 1995-1996 academic year.  The University of Washington is  uniquely suited for this research because the School of Fisheries  maintains excellent laboratories for research on salmonid fishes  and expertise in the flow sorting of chromosomes and single copy in  situ hybridization exists in the department of Molecular Biology  and Biotechnology.  Dr. Phillips is developing collaborative  projects with faculty members in the School of Fisheries on  chromosome mapping and related projects.    Interactive activities include teaching a graduate seminar in  molecular systematics and giving guest lectures in the Molecular  Techniques class.",
