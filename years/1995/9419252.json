 "awd_abstract_narration": "MCB-94-19252  Abstract    This is a proposal to examine the signal recognition steps  in the expression of the virulence (vir) genes necessary for  the transfer of DNA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens into  susceptible, wounded plant cells.  The vir gene system is  encoded on the Ti plasmid and is in part comprised of  the  genes for the transmitter/receiver complex (virA and vir G).  The ability of the vir A/vir G system to respond to a broad  range of compounds, and yet provide sufficient interaction  enrgy to transmit information, might be achieved by the  catalysis of the transfer of a phenolic proton to the  receptor, thereby activating the signal transduction  cascade.  This model makes several mechanistic predictions  which have already given rise to the synthesis of the first  known inhibitors of vir expression.  The previous studies  have been in vivo; in this study  in vitro testing of these  predictions is accomplished by examination of  the  autophosphorylation of VirA in a reconstituted system.  Methods for the synthesis of the required inducer analogs  and molecular genetic manipulation of VirA are in place.  Affintiy labeling reagents based on the inhibitors have  implicated two phenol-binding proteins, p10 and P21, as  likely candidates for the phenol receptors.  These, as well  as the other proteins identified in screens for the  requisite chemical reactivity, will be purified, sequenced  and the sequence used to isolate the respective genes to  test their relevance in vir expression.  %%%  The ability to obtain transgenic plants for basic research  and for biotechnological enhancement of our nation's food  supply has in large part been made possible through plant  infection with  transformed Agrobacterium tumifaciens, a  bacterium which causes Crown Gall disease in nature.  The  mechanism of DNA transfer and how the bacterium can \"sense\"  an appropriate site for transfer is unknown.   This proposal  deals with the latter point and will isolate and  characterize the proteins which  perceive the appropriate  \"signalling\" cues provided by the plant.  These cues are  plant phenolics which, in most instances, serve as  antibiotics.    A. tumifaciens  is sensitive to these  phenols and \"hones in\" on them, perceiving them through an  interesting signalling mechanism which may provide a model  for plant recognition of hormones or bacterial recognition  of small molecules. The work characterizes the phenol  binding proteins and the proteins involved in relaying  binding information to the cell.  To do that,  in vitro  reconstitution of part of the signalling pathway will be  done using purified \"stabilized\" proteins involved in this  signaling cascade.  The proteins are stabilized by  synthesizing an active, but truncated version of the protein  through genetic engineering.  The outcome of the experiments  will be to shed light on this biotechnologically important,  yet fundamental signalling event.  ***",
