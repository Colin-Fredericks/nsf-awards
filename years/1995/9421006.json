 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421006  Reisman  This is for 100% selective chemical vapor deposition of expitaxial films of Si, Ge and  SiGe on patterned substrates with a so-called 'smart' chemistry based upon interrupting the flow of hydrogen during the deposition process.  The PI's refer to this process as 'alternating cyclic, AC, deposition' which has been tested and demonstrated to be effective during previous research.  The PI's wish to \"further understand the underlying science\" of the 'smart chemistry' with a study of the parameter space associated with the gaseous species involved in the reaction kinetics.  The research is relevant to the selective growth of films on patterned substrates and the removal of unwanted foreign particles.  This research may open new areas of device research, particularly with Si-Ge hetero-junction bipolar transistors (HBT's) for high frequency, microwave devices.  The research and education potential offers the possibility of new devices structures for the silicon-base integrated circuit industry.  The unique capability of the CVD system at MCNC remains at the heart of the research and is essential is this work is to continue to bear new and interesting results.  ***",
