A variety of approaches will be taken in order to understand how kn1 functions. Additional loss-of-function mutants will be obtained. Excisions of the transposable element Ds from a Ds-induced dominant allele in corn will be analyzed and anti-sense phenotypes of the Arabidopsis homologue will be obtained. Two approaches for isolating potential downstream target genes will be taken. The Arabidopsis over expression phenotype will be used to isolate suppressors and to find enhancer trap lines whose expression patterns change in relation to ectopic expression of kn1 or its homologue. Concurrently, a subtractive library made from maize knotted leaves will be used to isolate clones that show increased expression in knotted leaves as compared to normal leaves. Those clones will be characterized and expression patterns determined.   %%%  Plant development occurs by the action of meristems, groups of self-renewing cells whose derivatives elaborate the organs of the mature plant. In order to understand how the meristem functions, it is important to identify genes that play a role in the meristem. The kn1 homeobox containing gene is a reasonable candidate for a gene which influences meristem development and a variety of experiments and approaches will be taken in order to understand how this gene functions.  ***",
