Instead of  merely  transforming the way commerce is done today from a non-electronic  world to an electronic platform, the new way of commerce will  create and demand radical changes in the process, product and  promotion to better exploit the digital platform.    However, this emerging electronic market place is an unknown and  needs to be understood.  The goal is to use emerging technology  to create a business environment or infrastructure that will  ensure efficient electronic markets.  What does it take in terms  of new organization structures like the network structures  facilitated by smart and wireless messaging; new electronic  institutions such as brokerages staffed by electronic brokers or  agent; new business processes better suited for mass  customization, global sourcing and logistic; new financial  payment mechanisms and mercantile protocols?    To achieve exploration and exploitation of new frontiers, we need  to integrate business concerns with the changing technology.  The  conference aims to provide this integration by bringing together  leading business researchers who specialize in the various facets  of electronic markets, namely economics, finance, marketing  production and operations management, and technology experts in  the industry who are creating the Electronic Commerce  infrastructure.  In addition, experts who specialize in the World  Wide Web browsers, electronic cash, encryption, software agents,  MIME-based messaging and EDI and Structured documents will be  invited.    The outcome of conference will be a better understanding of the  shape, structure, and operation of business in the coming  millennium.",
