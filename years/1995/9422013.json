 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical summary    Relationship Among Demographic, Social, and Genetic  Structure    Recent results from Altmann's studies provided the most  complete genetic analysis of any wild nonhuman primate group  and identified paternity and genetic structure in a baboon  group that is striking for its reflection of observed  behavior.  The analyses relating social structure, behavior,  and genetic structure can now be extended to enable  evaluation of the magnitude of variability over time and  space for these long-lived animals that, like humans, mature  slowly and exhibit a considerable range of behavior and  group composition.  The extent of variability in behavior  and in its effects on genetic structure is important for its  implications for evolution and biodiversity.  A second major  goal of the present study, therefore, will be to identify  particular behavioral and other mechanisms that produce the  relationships between social and genetic structure.  These  include investigations of the conditions and mechanisms  whereby mate choice and alliances modify the power of male  dominance status to determine paternity and those whereby  close relatives are recognized and avoided as mates when the  ubiquitous mechanism of emigration from the group of birth  is not sufficient for avoiding inbreeding.  These kinds of  behavioral and other mechanisms are essential components of  basic evolutionary processes.  They may also be significant  determinants of survival under critical conditions such as  low population density or population fragmentation, in which  case an understanding of mechanisms and their functioning  can provide not only a potent predictor of population  response but also a powerful management tool for shaping  outcomes.",
