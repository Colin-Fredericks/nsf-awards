 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concepts of molecular structural are second in chemical  importance only to knowledge of a compound's elemental  composition and should therefore be introduced early.   Recent  declines in cost and increases in speed of machine computation  allow computer modeling to be used for such purposes in  baccalaureate level instruction as they have been by practicing  chemists.   This project focuses on the organic chemistry  laboratory, combining molecular modeling, molecular mechanics,  and electronic structure calculations.   The lab provides  students with the experience and ability to apply molecular  structural concepts in elucidating chemical problems.   The  approach builds on the department's experience with computational  chemistry, thus expanding the range of problems encountered and  techniques taught, and emphasizing display of the results as  high-quality molecular images which can be manipulated and  combined to provide greater insight into the structural basis for  chemical behavior.",
