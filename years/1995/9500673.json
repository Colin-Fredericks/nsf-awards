 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is exploring the possibility of a parallel programming  paradigm that is data-distribution independent (DDI) in the sense  that the user would not be required to program or even invoke data  communication routines (hereon called modules).  The need for data  redistribution would either be eliminated or transparent to the  user.  The emphasis this work is on the systematic design of  computational modules so that either there is no need to  redistribute input data or, when this cannot be achieved, the cost  of (automatic) redistributionis minimized.  In this context,  source-to-source program transformations, called modular mappings,  and properties that allow commutative parallel processing are being  explored as techniques and concepts that enable DDI computation.   The extent to which a DDI paradigm could replace existing  approaches, complement them or merely apply to special application  domains is unclear and this is one of the issues under  investigation.  In addition, hardware and architecture features  that support DDI computation on both general and special purpose  aprallel processors are being investigated.  The experimental  validation is being done in the context of three application areas  and program implementations on a fine-grain distributed memory SIMD  machine (Maspar MP-1 with 16 thousand processors) and a coarse-  grain distributed memory MIMD machine (Intel Paragon with 140  processors).  The areas of interest are dense linear algebra,  sparse linear algebra and symbolic compute algebra which can be  applied to numerous scientific and engineering computing problems.   For these three areas, DDI modules are being developed as well as  entire programs built of several modules.  Performance comparisons  are being made between DDI implementation and their non-DDI  counterparts.",
