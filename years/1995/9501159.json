 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Jeremy K. Burdett at the Department of Chemistry, the   University of Chicago, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program at NSF to study the solid state chemistry   of a variety of compounds. In particular, the supported research   addresses problems in four important areas of structural chemistry where,   although there is a great deal of experimental data, the chemical   understanding of this data is very limited. The four areas being studied   concern: (1) nonstoichiometric materials; (2) stabilities of differently   coordinated crystal structures; (3) oxidation states of transition metal   ions; and, (4) Zintl phases. The approach being used involves accurate   LMTO and LAPW band structure calculations followed by more approximate   tight binding, TB, calculations. The accurate LMTO and LAPW results are   being  fit to a set of TB parameters so as to be able to make maximal   connections between chemists ideas of orbitals and solid state physicists   band structure results.   An important and, in some measure, unique feature of the work supported   under this grant is that the accurate band structure methods are used in   combination with the more approximate but conceptually valuable tight   binding methods. This combination has the capability to provide real   chemical insights which can guide understanding and which provide   predictive power. The great advances in computer hardware and programs   have made it increasingly easy to generate accurate numbers for the   problems being studied under this grant. The challenge being addressed by   the supported work lies in understanding the chemical and physical   meaning of the accurate numbers.",
