 "awd_abstract_narration": "The summer field course is the single most important  undergraduate geology course because it unifies all the diverse  aspects of the science.   Unlike other parts of a geology  curriculum, the field course in most colleges has remained  unchanged dor several decades.   This project adds a new  dimension to traditional field training by integrating it with  several new computer-based technologies that are currently  revolutionizing the earth sciences.   Through the use of  Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning  Satellites (GPS), computer mapping, and 3-D visualization, the  new field course teaches students how these technologies can be  utilized to improve their ability to handle the increasingly  difficult task of dealing with the large and diverse data sets  needed to solve today's complex problems.   When the new  technologies are used in a classical field course, the  traditional emphasis on data collection can be shifted to data  synthesis and interpretation.   Students' critical thinking  skills can only be enhanced by such a change.   Formulation and  testing of hypotheses based upon field data are a cornerstone of  the new curriculum.   As a result, students can be better  prepared for the interdisciplinary role that today's geologist  must play in dealing with complex problems.",
