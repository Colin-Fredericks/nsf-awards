 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported under the Optical Science and Engineering  initiative in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,  involves the continued development and application of time resolved  photocalorimetric and Raman spectroscopic methods for the  characterization of the kinetics, energetics, and molecular  structure of short-lived photochemical species within microscale  domains. A variety of novel methods will be pursued which will  detect very fast reactions occurring within micron to nanometer  dimensions, such as may be evident in monolayer, thin film, and  colloidal systems. Pulsed-laser Raman spectroscopy will be used to  probe free-radical chain initiation reactions; optically launched  surface acoustic waves (SAW) will allow the detection of  polymerization reaction kinetics within the monolayer region of  thin films; a new `photon burst` spectroscopic method which  involves the laser excitation of fluorescent-labeled particles and  the laser-induced rupture of analyte encapsulated liposomes will  allow the determination of particle size distribution and reaction  chemistry within colloidal media. These techniques are `cutting-  edge` and will offer technology not currently available for probing  these environments.  Next generation advances in the information, manufacturing, and  medical technologies will require the ability to engineer and/or  probe microscopic areas at nanosecond timescales. Professor Harris  and his students at the University of Utah will pursue several  cutting-edge laser spectroscopic techniques that will allow the  characterization of processes occurring within single cells, at  `stress-fracture` interfaces in materials and/or inside other  miniaturized structures.",
