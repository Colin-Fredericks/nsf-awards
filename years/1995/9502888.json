 "awd_abstract_narration": "9502888  Menoni  A four year career development program that combines a research  plan in the technological important area of blue semiconductor  lasers and educational activities centered in the development of a  freshmen course \"Introduction to Electrical Engineering\" designed  to motivate students early on in their career, is proposed.    A research plan is proposed to study the optical and electronic  properties of the II-VI quaternary ZnMgSSe which have significant  potential for the development of short wavelength semiconductor  lasers.  Short wavelength semiconductor lasers will greatly impact  high density optical memories, laser printing and other important  technological applications, whose capabilities are presently  limited by the use of infrared laser sources.  Blue-green laser  have been demonstrated.  However, their output characteristics are  still far from being ideal for most of these applications.   Improved characteristics will arise from a detailed understanding  of the material properties and device structure dependent processes  which control the laser operation.  I propose to study carrier  confinement, the mechanisms of carrier capture and escape and  recombination in ZnMgSSe MQWs.  The results of these studies will  be first applied to the development of edge emitting lasers which  will be characterized from threshold current and gain and loss  measurements.  The knowledge gained in the study of edge emitters  will be applied to the design of vertical cavity surface emitting  lasers.    The main focus of the proposed educational activities lie in the  development of a freshmen course \"Introduction to Electrical  Engineering.\"  This course is designed to captivate the interest of  the students into the different areas of Electrical Engineering at  an early stage on their career, and thus reduce the drop-out rate.   I also envision this class as an avenue to teach them different  tools they will use throughout their career and to show them how  fun and challenging this pr ofession can be.  ***",
