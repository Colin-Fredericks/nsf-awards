 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500983  Nies       Nies' research concerns areas of algebra and logic that involve  coding with first-order properties in structures and in classes of   structures.  He is interested in proving undecidability of fragments of  elementary theories consisting of sentences with few quantifier  alternations, in particular, for theories of classes of finite  groups, the theory of finite distributive lattices, and for the   theory of the lattice E of enumerable sets.  Interest in such fragments   arises from their containing the first-order sentences that usually occur  in mathematical practice.  Moreover, he will work toward determining the   complexity of theories of degree structures from structural complexity   theory and toward using coding methods to investigate model-theoretic  properties of the structure D of enumerable Turing degrees.  Both E and D  are central structures in computability theory.  Also using coding methods,  he intends to prove nonelementary equivalence of various degree structures  and intends to introduce a measure of the informational content of  isomorphism types of structures belonging to various classes of structures  from model theory.  In a further project, he plans to separate complexity  classes that are generalizations of deterministic and nondeterministic  linear time.       The general idea of coding is to represent objects of one kind by  objects of another kind, with a fixed decoding key used to retrieve the   information from an object of the second kind.  In this project, the   objects are certain structures from algebra, computability theory, and   model theory.  The decoding key consists of a collection of formulas  in first-order logic, a formal language which can be viewed as a   formalization of a major part of natural language within mathematics.  A   coding of a structure A in a structure B guarantees that B is at least as   complex as A.  Nies will investigate the abstract ordering on classes of all   possibly infinite structures by comparing their co mplexity and will apply   similar methods to classes of finite structures, a field which has been the  focus of interest in recent years for its connections with computer science.  In a second part of this project, coding methods will be applied to  computability theory, that part of mathematical logic which deals with  computability in the ideal sense.  Undecidable sets can vary with respect to  their computational complexity.  The goals here, beyond determining the  complexity of the associated first-order theory, are to find out the  symmetries of the structures and to find a simple characterization of these  structures.  These questions are important for deepening the understanding  of computation.  ***",
