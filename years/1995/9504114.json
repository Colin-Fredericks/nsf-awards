J. Wilkes.  Mr.  Stachyra will divide his time among three different research sites over the course  of his six month stay in Japan, during which he will be sponsored by the Professor  Yoji Totsuka, the head of the Super-Kamiokande Group at the Institute for Cosmic  Ray Research (ICRR) in Tokyo.  Super-Kamiokande is a water Cherenkov detector  to be located in the Kamioka Mozumi mine in Japan.  Super Kamiokande is  expected to provide new information that will be useful in the study of neutrino  oscillations, in solar modeling, in supernova modeling, and in setting new limits on  nucleon decay partial lifetimes. Mr. Stachyra will spend approximately one month  at the ICRR learning how the Japanese data acquisition equipment works, two  months at the KEK particle accelerator learning about and contributing to  calibration experiments being conducted with a smaller Cherenkov detector there,  and about three months will be spent at the mine site learning the details of detector  construction before data taking begins in April of 1996.  Mr. Stachyra will learn the  Japanese style for constructing electronics for high energy physics experiments and  will be able to compare the Japanese system with the U.S. system.  He will be able  to compare the advantages and drawbacks of both systems and learn when one is  preferred over the other.  ***",
