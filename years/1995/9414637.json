 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor James Pustejovsky of Brandeis  University and a graduate student to collaborate in computational  linguistics research with Susan Armstrong and others at the  Institute of Semantic and Cognitive Studies (ISSCO) of the  University of Geneva, Switzerland.  The goal of their research is  to account for the way in which words combine, taking advantage  of the different perspectives from which this issue has been  approached, namely, lexicographic, linguistic and statistical.  The problem is to establish a connection between computational  semantic theories and practical systems dealing directly with  modeling language use through `usage-based` criteria.  The  Brandeis group brings substantial theoretical experience on  lexical semantics and natural language generation, while the  Swiss group contributes the computational platform and the  multilingual environment for analyzing text, as well as  experience in machine translation systems. Collaboration between  the U.S. and Swiss research teams will introduce a cross-  linguistic perspective by taking advantage of information derived  from the analyses of multilingual corpora provided by the Swiss  participants.  Specifically, the Swiss group is involved in a  project to produce automatic multilingual generation of the  weather forecasts produced by the Swiss Institute of Meteorology.  This collaborative research contributes to the empirical  grounding of a theory of semantic selection.  Fundamentally, it  looks at how word meaning in natural language might be  characterized formally, in order to account for both the subtle  use of words in different sentences, and the `creative` use of  words in novel contexts.  The integration of rule-based technique  and data driven technique is a major area of interest in natural  language processing research.  On a practical level, this  research will contribute to the development of a multilingual  generator and the enhancement of machine translation systems.",
