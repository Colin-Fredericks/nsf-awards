 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's goal is the development of a logical approach to   the study of computational complexity.  The approach will exploit   two of the  main traditions in mathematical logic, namely, (a) model theory and   (b) proof theory.  Model theory  studies the relation between logical  languages and their interpretations and  has developed powerful  techniques to answer questions about the expressive  power of a  variety of logical languages.  Proof theory studies the notion of  logical inference and elevates mathematical study.  In so doing,  proof theory  makes it possible to undertake a rigorous  examination of the complexity of  establishing conclusions within  a given system of inference.    A significant  feature of this logical approach is that it  forgoes, to a large extent, the use  of machine models of  computation in the study of complexity.  Much valuable  work in  complexity theory has involved careful analysis of the resource  requirements of various algorithms on the specified abstract  machines.  This  project seeks to obtain new insights into the  complexity of combinatorial  problems by analyzing these problems  in machine-independent, logical terms.  Among the questions  considered are whether the polynomial time decidable  properties  of finite graphs are recursively enumerable and whether   NP = co-NP.  Negative answers to either of these questions would imply   that  P is not equal to NP.  Though  these implications are certainly significant, the  focus of the project is to  achieve a deeper understanding of the  problems themselves by the use of logical  techniques.",
