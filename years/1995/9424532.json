The conference is held under the auspices of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). There will be ten major sessions and poster sessions. The topics to be included for discussion are: biochemistry of transcription, control through different sigmas, activation, repression, promoter recognition, and control of transcription in complex systems. The purpose of the meeting is to bring together geneticists and biochemists to share information. The field of transcription initiation in prokaryotes is progressing rapidly, providing information on mechanisms at the molecular level.This is the third FASEB Summer Conference on this subject. The first two, in 1991 and 1993, were well attended.  %%%  Transcription, the synthesis of RNA molecules from DNA templates, is the first step in the expression of genes, a process fundamental   to life.  During this meeting researchers seeking to understand transcription at the molecular level through the study of bacteria will exchange ideas and information.  Such understanding has the potential to greatly benefit mankind.  ***",
