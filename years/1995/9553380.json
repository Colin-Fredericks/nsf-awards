The student training will  include an appreciation and  understanding of the current state  of the U.S. Infrastructure systems,  an exposure to advances in other  areas of critical importance to  encourage interdisciplinary  technology transfer and  development, and internships abroad  and in national laboratories and  industries to provide the cultural  breadth and to bridge theory and  application. The research program  for each student will emphasize a  unified strategy towards  deterioration science, assessment  technologies, and renewal  engineering. This research vision  will enable the student to leapfrog  the current myopic strategy of  \"design and new construction\" to  unified strategy that recognizes  the importance of a systems  approach, good science, new and  emerging technologies and sound  management practices to sustain  infrastructure over its life. The  proposed training program will  provide the graduates with the  opportunity to be future leaders in  the development and sustenance of  U.S. and international  infrastructure. We will actively  recruit underrepresented groups  building on our success with  working with women graduate  students and utilizing our links to  other institutions. We have an  excellent track record with respect  to retention and intend to maintain  this through not only providing a  unique education experience but  also by maintaining strong advisor-  student relationships. The  innovative elements of the program  are also attractive for students  interested in a holistic graduate  experience.",
