There are two types of  considerations which affect salience, stable considerations  (where issues are always on the agenda) and contextual  considerations (where media coverage or candidate positions  determine whether the issue is on the agenda).  Past research  demonstrates how the media may influence voter preferences  through framing, priming and agenda setting.  In this research,  other considerations (candidate positioning and the number of  candidates) are examined which may influence salience regardless  of the amount of media coverage devoted to an issue.  Three  models are developed to explain why issues are salient to voters:  utility difference, similarity, and threshold.  The models are  tested using survey research (the 1992 National Election Studies  Presidential Election pretest) and experimental studies.    The research addresses a fundamental question which has not been  studied adequately in voting research, namely, what makes issues  salient.  Searching for possible answers to this question will  benefit the study of elections in the future.  By identifying  possible sources of issue salience, the proposal may offer new  explanations of how issues influence elections.  ***",
