 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two software systems, RRL (the Rewrite Rule Laboratory)   SATO (SAtisfiability Test Optimized), developed under the    past grant, have been  successfully used for solving many  problems often considered   a challenge for  automated theorem  provers, including several dozens of open   problems in  quasigroups.  The current research will further increase the    reasoning power of  RRL and SATO.  The objectives of this  research are to   develop new high  performance reasoning  algorithms, and to apply these   algorithms in  specification  and verification of hardware and software, and   in solving  open  problems in algebra, logic and combinatorics. The  research   focuses on  constraint satisfaction and automated  mathematical   induction.  The topics  include efficient  constraint propagation, parallel and   distributed reasoning,  intelligent induction schemata formulation, management of    large proofs, and  implementation and experimentation of all  the involved   algorithms.  Practical  problems will be chosen  from software and hardware design   verification and  combinatorics as test problems for both RRL and SATO.  Both    systems will be  enhanced to meet the need of large-scale  applications by   user-friendly interfaces.  Special  effort will be made to   distribute RRL and  SATO to the  automated reasoning community worldwide.",
