 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523048  Coullard   This research addresses several related problems in the areas of manufacturing and distribution. The research seeks to develop models and methodologies that can be used to simultaneously make decisions on the location of manufacturing and distribution facilities, production quantities, assignment of products to facilities, and quantities of each product type to assign to a given distribution center. In particular, using the models, the following decisions can be made: (1) determination of the types of production and distribution systems to be built or maintained and where they should be located, (2) the assignment of products to facilities and the timing of production,  (3) the allocation of shipment quantities of each product type from each facility to each distribution center, and (4) the shipping route to be used from each production facility to each distribution center. This is a research that integrates several subproblems in both production and distribution. Some of the items to be optimized are strategic in nature (e.g., facility location) while others are tactical (production schedule and production quantities) Each of the subproblems in the integrated model is difficult to solve by its own right. Thus, the integrated problem would obviously be large and much more difficult to solve to simultaneously optimize on the various subproblems included in the model. However, to overcome the size problem, the following three major goals are established: (1) develop realistic and flexible optimization models that incorporate in a reasonable manner the tactical and strategic issues that are involved, (2) employ a solution approach that is based on the branch-and-price and row generation technique that takes advantage of special structures of the model, and (3) develop systematic techniques for evaluating the robustness of the strategic decisions made by the model.    Although, integrated models as addressed in this research pose major solution and computational challenges, they  do , however, provide some major benefits. Equipped with these models, a decision maker will have a direct knowledge of the impact of strategic choices on tactical issues, and can thus make intelligent strategic decisions. Furthermore, such models provide an integrated framework to analyze the sensitivity of a system on various decision elements. The models developed are integer programming models. This work involves identifying the right tree management scheme for solving  integer programs by branch and bound  and the right column management scheme for solving the linear programs within the branch and bound. In so doing, this research also advances the knowledge in solving integer programming models.",
