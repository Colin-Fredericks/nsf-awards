 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds for the proposal will be used for completion of post-conference activities, including publication of a volume of invited presentations on Global Change and Arctic Terrestrial Ecosystems.  The international conference was held on August 21-26, 1993 in Oppdal, Norway.  Since the cessation of the International Biological Program of the early 1970's, the arctic reqearch community has not maintained an active and effective system of meetings and communication.  This meeting represented the first global conference directed towards arctic terrestrial ecosystems in 20 years, and was a truly rare opportunity for a large, open meeting, involving both Russian and western scientists, to evaluate the potential effects and associated feedbacks of climate change on the arctic tundra.  The main goal of the conference was to foster international cooperation, collaboration, and the exchange of ideas among arctic systems scientists.  The proposed book is expected to be an authoritative evaluation of the current state of knowledge regarding the anticipated effects of global change on arctic ecosystems.  It is anticipated that the proceedings of the meeting will lay the foundation for continued integration and evaluation of arctic research in relation to global change.",
