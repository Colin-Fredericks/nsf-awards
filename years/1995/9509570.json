 "awd_abstract_narration": "The entomological collections at The Carnegie Museum of Natural History (CMNH) are  scientific resources of international significance, containing 6.5 million prepared specimens and more  than five million unprepared ones.  Among New World institutions, CMNH has the third largest  collection of Lepidoptera and the most diverse collection of Afrotropical insects, associated with a  library of exceptional historical coverage for systematic research.  The rate that CMNH specimens are  being used by researchers and students has risen dramatically in recent years with specimen loans and  scientific visitors at the highest levels in CMNH history.  Collection growth is at unprecedented  levels, due to fieldwork worldwide, donation of private collections,  and survey programs addressing  biodiversity issues.   Specimen integrity, research use, and growth of the collection are hindered by  housing problems.  More than half of available wooden storage equipment is in perilous condition; only  22% of existing storage is acceptable by modern standards.  Old insect drawers housing the Lepidoptera  are frag ile and breaking with age, and are unsuitable for using unit trays.  Specimens are packed  into drawers at maximum density, preventing curation and hindering use in research.  Collections in  fluids and on glass slides require modern storage.  Backlog preparation is required for specimens of  unique value, including 130,00 papered Lepidoptera and fragile specimens in alcoholic bulk samples.  This three-year project will resolve these problems by accomplishing the following goals: 1.  Renovate  new space in the Carnegie Museum for expanding collection storage and associated research areas (CMNH cost-sharing; see Appendix 2, J-49). 2.  Transfer and rehouse 41% of the Lepidoptera collection into a compactorized storage system containing quality drawers and unity trays (NSF funding requested for labor and storage equipment; CMNH cost-sharing for labor). 3.  Transfer to new drawers and unit trays all non-Lepidoptera currently in unacceptable temporary containers (NSF funding requested for labor and storage equipment). 4.  Obtain equipment necessary for transfer, maintenance, and curation of the collection (NSF funding requested for stereomicroscopes, computers, printers, and freezers for non-  chemical pest control). 5.  Provide special attention to specimens of exceptional scientific value (  NSF funding requested for labor to segregate and conserve type specimens and to prepare specimens of  greatest value form backlog storage; CMNH cost-sharing for labor to recondition historically important  specimens). 6.  Provide preliminary curation of taxa currently represented by large numbers of  prepared but unsorted specimens (CMNH cost-sharing for visiting specialists).",
