 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stahl    With National Science Foundation support Dr Peter Stahl will  analyze a large collection of archaeological fauna from the site  of La Chimba which is located in the Pichincha Province of  Ecuador. The site, which was excavated in the 1970s and 1980s is  important because its stratified deposits are extremely rich in  well preserved faunal remains as well as other materials such as  ceramics and stone tools. Based on radiocarbon dates, it spans an  almost 1,000 year interval and includes the period when domestic  animals first appeared in the region. Dr. Stahl will conduct an  extensive faunal analysis and focus on both the guinea pig and  the camelids (which include a number of species). He will  categorize all identifiable pieces by species, body part and  cultural treatment. We will also xray a number of specimens to  determine bone density which determines the probability that a  type of bone will be preserved. On this basis he hopes to gain  insight into the introduction of these important domesticates  into their northerly end of their prehistoric range and to  determine the effect they had on local economy and other aspects  of culture.    The South American Andean region saw the rise of one of the great  prehistoric civilizations of the world. Anthropologists wish to  understand the processes which underlay the rise of civilization  and, because of the wealth of archaeological information  available, have focussed on this region. They know that the  domestication of plants and animals is an important factor in  this process. It is unlikely that either camelids or guinea pig  were domesticated this far North but were rather they were  probably introduced in already domesticated form. Through his  study of the La Chimba faunal remains Dr. Stahl will be able to  assess in a direct manner the social effect of these  introductions.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists and will also increase  our understanding of ho w complex societies develop. Finally the  density measurements will be widely used by faunal analysts in a  number of contexts.",
