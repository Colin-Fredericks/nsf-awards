 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553350  Leslie-Pelecky  Participation in outreach, in addition to research, as part of  the training of graduate students in science and engineering will  be established and institutionalized.  Nine graduate students per  year will be funded to assist with the development of materials  for the outreach program.  Other graduate students, faculty, and  staff will work with the program on a volunteer basis. The  supported students will represent a wide range of disciplines  covering most of the sciences and engineering. Student awardees  will receive an enhanced stipend, $1000 for travel to a  professional meeting, and funding for purchase and/or  construction of demonstrations in their field. The outreach  project has as its basis scripted modules that develop a  scientific or technical concept using demonstrations and hands-on  activities supervised by members of the outreach group.  Graduate  student participation by both the awardees and volunteers will  assist in the development of skills such as: communicating the  importance of science and engineering to non-scientists, learning  the fundamentals of grant writing, improving oral communication,  and working with the media.  Centralization of these efforts will  create productive links between different departments and centers  on campus, as well as provide an efficient means for increasing  the competitiveness of graduates in the job market.  As part of  the project, a professional development seminar open to all  graduate students will be offered.  Topics covered will include  job hunting skills (writing a vita, interviewing), professional  skills (writing papers and proposals, presenting technical talks)  and outreach-related topics (working with children, communicating  with the media).  After the materials development phase, future  plans call for dissemination to colleges and high schools  throughout the state, in conjunction with conferences to prepare  the new users for outreach activity.",
