The research draws on theoretical debates about the relationship between economic and political change in post-communist countries, and about the importance of networks and quasi-private institutions in regional economic development.  The Veliko Tarnovo region in north-central Bulgaria was chosen as the focus region, because it has a strong historical identity as a region, is distant enough from Sofia to have a distinct economy and institutions, and has avoided the acrimonious political discord of the capital.  Thus, the investigators expect the region to be among Bulgaria's prime candidates to develop indigenous institutions to promote competitive private enterprise.  Data are to be drawn from archival sources and structured interviews, making use of the investigators' prior work in Bulgaria and fluency in Bulgarian.  The project will test the much-discussed contributions of sub-national, regional networking and cooperation to economic development, in a very different political and institutional context than most of the published literature.",
