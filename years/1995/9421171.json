 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421171  Zahler    The sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase) is a protein located in the membrane of cells that helps to control the size (volume) of the cells, and their salt and water content.  In addition, the ability of nerve and heart cells to generate the electrical energy necessary for muscular contraction depends on this enzyme.  The sodium pump is especially important in the heart, where its activities are crucial for regulating the strength of contraction.  The sodium pump is also the target of action of digitalis, a commonly used cardiac medication.  Because of the pivotal role of this enzyme system, many scientists have studied its function.  New techniques, however, have revealed that the sodium pump is much more complex than was believed a few years ago.  These techniques have been used to show that there are at least three different forms of the sodium pump, produced at different times in different parts of the heart.  It has been shown that the cardiac conduction system, which controls the rhythm of the heartbeat, concentrates a particular type of sodium pump.  Also, the number of these pumps appear to vary during pathologic changes such as cardiac enlargement (seen in hypertension) or heart failure.  The pumps and their response to stress are important because they help regulate the strength of cardiac contraction, and transmission of electrical signals within the heart.  This project will analyze the roles of the different forms of the sodium pump by using genetic engineering to create mice that have an abnormal distribution of pump types in their hearts, and evaluating the effect of these changes on the sodium pumping characteristics of cells from these hearts.  Different types of cultured human cells will also be genetically engineered in a similar manner.  Not only does the heart produce several different forms of the sodium pump, but the pump types found in hearts from newborn animals are different from the types of pumps in hearts from older animals.  The second goal of the project is  to better understand the genetic mechanism that controls the switching of pump types in the heart.  This work may lead to a better understanding of the effects and toxicity of digitalis-like drugs on the heart.  ***",
