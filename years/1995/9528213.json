C.  and McEwen, Bruce    Social stress is a common and enduring feature of life with  important behavioral and physiological effects.  A  multidisciplinary research collaboration between the Laboratory of  Behavioral Neurobiology at the University of Hawaii and the  Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology at Rockefeller University is aimed  at description and analysis of these effects.  Previous work  indicates that single, two-week stress periods can produce  increased defensive behavior and decreased social and reproductive  behavior; higher levels of stress hormones and impairment of  mechanisms that normally limit stress hormone action; and  widespread changes in brain neurochemical systems.  Although these  changes are beginning to provide insights into the dynamics of the  physiological and behavioral response to chronic social stress,  completed studies have measured only a single time point in the  process.  The proposed program will investigate the development of  stress-related behavioral and physiological changes over time, and  will determine the persistence of stress effects following single  or multiple periods of chronic social stress.  In addition,  individual differences will be examined as determinants of  responsivity to social stress.  The proposed program will thus draw  upon the different approaches and expertise of these two research  groups to provide a uniquely comprehensive description and analysis  of the effects of social stress in an ecologically appropriate  situation.",
