 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500615 Kath  The goal this project is to analyze the effect  various types of perturbations have upon the stability and  dynamics of soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger  equation. These perturbations include: periodic parametric  forcing, stochastic noise, and higher-order linear and nonlinear  derivatives. The intent is to develop and use approximate methods  which allow both a simple qualitative understanding of the  resulting pulse dynamics and an accurate quantitative description  that is as concise as possible.  The nonlinear Schroedinger  equation models pulse propagation in nonlinear optical fibers,  and in particular, optical solitons. As a result, an additional  goal of the project is to investigate mathematically whether it  is possible to use new optical fiber technologies to  significantly increase the transmission speed of optical  communication systems, or to improve upon the performance of  these systems. One application that is being examined along these  lines is the use of novel optical amplifier devices to control  solitons, such as the use of phase-sensitive parametric  amplifiers.",
