 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520730    Information is encoded in the brain by modifications in  cellular structure and changes in numbers of synaptic  connections between neurons.  The brain is organized into  discrete neural circuits which process specific types of  learned information and control specific behaviors.  When  the connections (synapses) within these neural circuits are  altered, the output of the circuit changes and the behavior  that it controls is modified.  The objective of this  research is to increase understanding of the development of  a learned behavior and the neural circuitry which controls  that behavior.  The development of one naturally occurring  learned behavior, bird song, will be related to the  development of synapses within specific song-related brain  areas.  Song in birds is a complex learned behavior that is  controlled by a highly localized system of interconnected  neurons.  Synapse numbers in song-related brain areas of  normally raised individuals and of individuals that have had  no opportunity for song learning will be quantified using  high magnification electron microscopy.  The singing  behavior and social behavior of both groups will be analyzed  to correlate neuroanatomical and behavioral changes.  Preliminary data indicate that song-deprived individuals  possess approximately 40% more synapses than normally raised  individuals.  This may indicate that song learning is  accompanied by a large scale reduction in synapse numbers.  This research will increase our understanding, not just of  the neural basis for song learning, but of principles and  mechanisms important for many different forms of learning in  different species of animals.",
