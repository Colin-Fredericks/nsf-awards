 "awd_abstract_narration": "Webb  MCB-9418608    The major form of biomineralization in plants is crystal  formation in the plant vacuole.  These crystals may have a  function in mineral sequestration, plant defense, and  structural protection of plant tissues. Vacuolar crystals  form in specific cell types, idioblasts, under precise  developmental and environmental control. The major thrust of  this proposal is to determine the protein components of the  organic matrix, the cellular matrix which may function by  providing a template for mineral deposition, by nucleating  crystal growth, by forming the chamber in which  mineralization occurs, or by influencing the cellular  environment in which the crystals form.  In grape leaves, a vacuolar membrane encloses each  individual calcium oxalate crystal. The membrane is part of  the organic matrix. This work will identify and characterize  the proteins on this membrane and the genes which encode  these proteins. The cellular disposition and abundance of  these proteins in crystal idioblasts and surrounding cells  will be determined with electron and light microscopy.  To  complement studies on the nature of these membrane  components, the developmental context of crystal formation  will be followed.  In this way, the key components of the  membrane contribution to the organic matrix can be  identified in relation the initiation and growth of  crystals.  %%%  Biomineralization, the biologically controlled formation of  mineral deposits, is crucial to the survival of many  organisms.  The formation of bones, teeth, and shells in  animals are important forms of biomineralization whose  functions are well-recognized.  Information about the  organic matrix provided for crystal growth in biological  organisms is being applied to materials science, where  organic macromolecules identified in biomineralization  systems can be used to manipulate the construction of thin  films and other crystalline materials.  Research may  identify novel calcium-binding proteins, crystal nucleating  s ubstances, or other molecules that promote or inhibit  crystal growth, with potentially wide application to  medicine, ecology, engineering, and ceramics.  %%%",
