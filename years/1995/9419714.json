 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division, Professor Richard A. Mathies of the University of California at   Berkeley will conduct a series of investigations to determine the ground   and excited-state nuclear dynamics and structural changes that occur in   condensed phase photochemical and photobiological reactions and thereby   understand their molecular reaction mechanisms.  The mode-specific   nuclear dynamics that occur immediately after excitation of a   photochemically active system will be determined by measuring and   analyzing absolute laser resonance Raman vibrational scattering   intensities.  Picosecond time-resolved resonance Raman and absorption   spectroscopy will be used to study the kinetics of ground-state   photoproduct formation and the structures and relaxation of ground-state   photochemical intermediates.  The following studies will be pursued. 1)   Photochemical ring-opening, ring-closing and 1,7 hydrogen shift reactions   of cyclic polyenes; 2) the response of protein environment in   bacteriorhodopsin and in phycobiliproteins to the electronic   excitation/photoisomerization of their bound chromophoric prosthetic   groups will be studied; 3) the photoexcitation of visual pigment   rhodopsin will be investigated; 4) the photochemical electron transfer   reaction in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers, and 5) the   mechanism of photochemical excitation of tetrapyrrole chromophore in   phytochrome, the light sensing pigment in plants, will be examined.  These investigations probe the basics of the interaction between light   and photo-biologically active materials and will contribute to our   understanding of the fundamental processes which take place in animate   and inanimate living systems.  The overall goal of this research is to   find general principles about how chemical reactions occur in condensed   phase photochemical systems  at room temperature.",
