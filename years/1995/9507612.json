 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507612  Weil  Among three related alleles of the maize waxy (Wx) gene. each caused by a 2 kilobase Ds insertion into precisely the same site, one allele, wx-m5:CS7 ((Ds) (CS7), reverts germinally as much as 90 fold less than the other two even though all three alleles show the same frequent, somatic reversion in the endosperm. The suppression of CS7 germinal reversion is genetically linked to Wx, independent of the transposase source and does not suppress excision by Ds insertions at other loci, suggesting a cis-acting mutation subjecting the CS7 Ds to a novel type of developmental control. The overall hypothesis tested in this proposal is that, because of a mutation in the CS7 Ds, the host plant can now suppress this transposon by developmentally restricting how accessible it is to proper transposase binding. Specifically: 1. The Ds elements in SD7, CS8, and CS8311B will be sequenced and compared, 2. DNA methylation will be compared and the excision rate quantitated at different stages during plant development, 3. The interaction of the DS elements will be tested by assaying the suppressiol of CS7 germinal reversion in CS7/CS8 heterozygotes, 4. cis- and trans-acting factors controlling CS7 excision will be identified and 5. maize proteins that bind the CS7 Ds and the CS8 Ds differently will be identified.  %%%  The goal of this research is to understand genetic control mechanisms in plants by examining mechanisms whereby plants regulate transposable element activity and how they interact with each other. Three transposons of corn which have inserted into identical positions on the corn genome have different germinal excision frequencies although such frequencies are identical in somatic cells. Studies will be initiated to determine the mechanisms controlling such differences in the corn plant. These studies will contribute to a more general understanding of factors regulating gene expression as well as allowing more insight into the participation of plant host factors in transposition.  ***",
