 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523010  Kovacevic   Abrasives in suspension in a  waterjet are used for cutting, hole making and duburring of titanium, ceramics, or other hard or difficult to machine materials.  These are one or two dimensional applications of this process, but there are opportunities for three dimensional processing as well.  Before a 3D process can be developed, a fundamental process model including the kinematics of the multiphase jet, the fluid-solid interaction at impact, and the fracture mechanics of the workpiece material is needed.  Before material is removed from the workpiece by fracture, the kinetic energies of many abrasives impact the surface.  As a result, a key part of this modeling work will be tracking the erosion history of the water jet on a section of the workpiece surface using a computational memory cell.  This process model will be able to predict the amount of material removed by many abrasives in the jet, and the geometry of the surface produced by the jet.  Like the cutter in conventional machining, the kinematics of the waterjet is guided by a controller.  Experiments to verify the process model, the coupling between the depth and particle velocity, and surfaces generated are part of the research.  To demonstrate 3D abrasive waterjet machining as a process, it will be used to produce a  sphere.     The impact of this research could be extremely high when fabricating complex shapes in high strength, high performance materials.    ***",
