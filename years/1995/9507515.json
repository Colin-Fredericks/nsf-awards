Kin  selection theory has successfully explained why a social  insect might help relatives instead of  trying to reproduce  alone, but a more difficult problem remains unsolved.  Given  that an individual decides to join a group, it should often  be selected to prefer being a reproductive rather than  helping.  But if this  is so, how is anarchy avoided, particularly in large  colonies where the queen cannot hope to physically dominate  all her subordinates?   The most promising hypothesis  appears to be collective worker control of reproduction, but  this possibility has not been tested very widely.          Strassmann and Queller will take advantage of  extensive past work on a species of social wasp,  Parachartergus colobopterus, to test for collective worker  control in three distinct contexts.  First, do workers  determine who lays the haploid male eggs?   Second, do  workers determine which of the numerous queens survives to  produce new queens?   Third, do workers determine the timing  and the identity of new queens?  In each case the  predictions will be derived from kin selection theory and  will be  tested through the analysis of videotaped behavior,  combined with kinship analysis based on DNA microsatellite  genotypes.          This research will ultimately reveal much about the  expression and resolution of genetic conflicts of interest.  It will also contribute to the new technology surrounding  microsatellite genes, methods which are important in many  areas, including evolutionary studies, conservation  genetics, forensics, and gene-mapping studies for  agricultural and medical needs.  Besides contributing to the  training of postdoctoral and graduate students, Strassmann  and Queller encourage p articipation of undergraduates,  high school students, and teachers who take the knowledge  they gain back to the classroom.",
