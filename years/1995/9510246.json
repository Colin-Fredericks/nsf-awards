The ultimate goal of these studies is  to  test  for  the  existence of extended, localized and  commensurate  states  in  different controllable potentials, to image these  states,  and to study their dynamics. Superconducting wire networks designed to  interact  with  a  penetrating flux lattice will be  fabricated  using  lithographic  techniques.  This work  will  focus  on  the  effect  of  anisotropy  where  striking theoretical predictions  have  been  made,  about  localization,  anisotropic  commensurability,  and  temperature  dependent  flux  lattice configurations. The pinning and  dynamics  of  Josephson   vortices   in  bulk  superconductors   will   be   further  investigated.  The exciting theoretical prediction of  magnetic  field  induced one dimensionalization of the electrons and the resulting  re-  establishment of superconductivity at high magnetic field will also be  experimentally  tested using high purity organic  superconductors.  In  another  experiment,  novel  lithographic  techniques  based  on  self  assembly  of  block  copolymers, will  be  used  to  fabricate  \"nano\"  periodic   potentials   (~   300Ao   spacing)   on   normal    metals,  superconductors and quantum Hall devices. This will allow the study of  a  new  regime where the periodic potential is comparable to  magnetic  lengths  and  much  shorter  than many  characteristic  dephasing  and  scattering length.  %%%  Superconducting  arrays  in  very  high  magnetic  field,  anisotropic  superconductors,  as  well  as  normal  metals  and  two   dimensional  heterostuctures  will  be  studied. Specifically  this  research  will  address  the  question of how the well understood periodic  potentials  can be extended to quasi-periodic potentials where there are competing  length scales and different types of anisot ropy.  Superconducting wire  networks designed to interact with a penetrating flux lattice will  be  fabricated using lithographic techniques. This work will focus on  the  effect of anisotropy where striking theoretical predictions have  been  made,   about   localization,   anisotropic   commensurability,    and  temperature  dependent flux lattice configurations.
