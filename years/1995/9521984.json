 "awd_abstract_narration": "EEC-9521984  Nemhauser    This award provides funding for a one year extension to capitalize  on the success and help expand the impact to other U.S.  manufacturing industries through the Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling/Logistics  Institute at Georgia Institute of Technology.    The continuing funding will support the basic research program in  the Center.  The Center will continue to develop research  activities and to advance the state-of-the-art understandings on  Logistics through several major core fundamental research  activities:  1) Logistics networks (including supply chain,  transportation, and material handling networks); 2) Logistics  environments (including urban, rural, and international logistics  and ergonomics, and environmental issues of logistics); 3)  Logistics information and decision technology (including logistics  information systems and computational logistics).  In addition, the  Center will continue to develop testbed research projects in  cooperation with its company members to conduct the proof-of-  concept implementation and prototyping.    Additional funding is provided for a woman undergraduate student to  work on two problems related to engineered storage areas:  1)  location assignment for components that should be clustered near  specific workstations within a workcenter due to their unique  usage, and 2) commonality of usage for a component focus stored in  multiple workcenters.",
