 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:  9526358, Rochester Institute of Technology, \"GOALI: Modulation Codes for Multiamplitude Recording Channels\", PI-McLaughlin:  This research is in the area of high density high data rate optical recording.  The optical recording technology receiving the most attention is magneto-optics.  While magnetic-optic drives are among the highest performing in both storage capacity and data transfer rate, their performance is limited.  In particular no commercially available high data rate (>40 Mbits/sec) digital recording system using a single head magneto-optic (or magnetic or optical) disk exists.  An optical recording technology known as electron trapping optical memory (ETOM) developed by Optex will be capable of providing single head data transfer rates in  excess of 100 Mbits/sec.  The ETOM material allows one to store multiple  signal amplitudes on the media as opposed to conventional saturation magnetic or optical recording.  This project is a joint Optex and RIT project in the development of modulation codes for the multiple amplitude recording channel.  The codes considered include both runlength limited and partial response techniques.  The principal investigator will spend time at Optex.\r\n*****************************************************************************\r\nAubrey M.
