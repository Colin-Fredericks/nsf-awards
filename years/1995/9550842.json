 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Computer and Information Sciences is developing  a hands-on laboratory, of 10 workstations, to enhance and  facilitate computer science majors' understanding of and experience  in networking and data communication applications.    This  equipment, which enables students to work in a supervised  laboratory environment, is used to implement practical exercises  that are coordinated with course lectures.   Emphasis is on  projects that allow students to explore the first four layers, and  the application layer, of the ISO/OSI model.   Using TCP/IP and  network simulation, activities permit students to experiment with,  simulate and troubleshoot different network configurations,  internetworking, interconnectivity, protocols, and LAN topologies.    Network design problems, which reinforce the concepts of top-down  design and modularity learned in software engineering and systems  analysis and design, are also addressed.   A network analyzer  permits students to monitor network traffic.   Guest lectures by  former students adds another layer of expertise to the curriculum.    Students are exposed to the networking tools and applications used  by industry and research.   Evaluation will be attitudinal and the  course will be disseminated at an SIGSE panel discussion and in a  laboratory manual for networking courses.",
