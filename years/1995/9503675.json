The Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS) and the  National Association of Marine Laboratories (NAML) will  conduct an appraisal of field station and marine laboratory  needs for the next decade.  Field stations and marine  laboratories are important sites for environmental research  and training.  These facilities represent a large and  continuing investment by both public and private  institutions, but are generally under equipped to respond  rapidly to new research needs.  Ongoing projects are field  stations and marine laboratories often suffer from  inadequate facilities and equipment.  Field Stations and  marine laboratories would benefit greatly by an objective  assessment and analysis of current facilities and future  needs, to better facilitate emerging national research  agendas.  This project will underwrite that assessment by  conducting an analysis of the needs of all field stations  and marine laboratories and will provide recommendations in  a published report.  The resulting document should serve to  guide potential funding sources, administrators, and others  who have oversight of field station and marine laboratory  facilities as they make decisions.",
