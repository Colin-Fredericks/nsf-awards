 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will help to prepare, and make available to the scientific community, a  complete, worldwide systematic catalog of spiders.  The project includes two phases.  The first phase  involves the publication of a third volume in the Advances in Spider Taxonomy series; that volume will  update and supplement existing, published systematic catalogs of spider biodiversity by detailing the  illustrated redescriptions of previously described species that were published form 1940 through 1980,  and by providing full coverage of the new literature published form 1992 through 1995.  The second  phase involves the production of a complete catalog through the capture, and merging with all the  post-1940 information, of relevant data from earlier published catalogs.  The complete bibliographic  and taxonomic files will be made available on Internet and CD-ROM (in both text and database formats,  for various computer platforms, with annual updates to follow).  The results will serve as authority  lists for all biodiversity projects involving spiders, and should eventually promote a stable nomencla  torial base for all biological studies of spiders and for use by scientists in agriculture and forest  management fields.",
