 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Northwest Center for Sustainable Resources (NCSR) project  is a collaborative effort of Northwest high schools, community  colleges, higher education institutions, private industry,  government agencies, and Native American tribes and of applied  international research groups to create a comprehensive center of  innovative educational programs to support the efforts of agencies,  industry, and business for ecosystem restoration and natural  resource management.  Program completers will enter employment as  advanced technicians in a variety of science-based occupations  targeting sustaining and restoring our natural resources or who can  continue for advanced degrees.  Associate degree programs in  diverse natural resource and environmental fields will be created  or undergo major curricular revisions to incorporate a central  focus on aquatic/terrestrial ecosystems.  Secondary schools and  colleges and universities will complete the conduit that will  provide a seamless delivery of basic scientific content, principles  and process culminating with hands-on applications, accomplishing  major systemic change.       Internships in industries and agencies will provide the  fertile ground to produce a workforce capable of contributing to a  unified approach to restoration, environmental clean-up, watershed  enhancement, sustainable forestry and fisheries, and habitat  restoration.  The Center programs will provide innovative,  transportable models for developing problem solving, communication,  and collaborative skills that match the requirements of an advanced  scientific, technologic workforce necessary to transform the  workplace to high performance.  The NCSR will provide a model for  collaborative efforts to address urgent regional, national, and  global needs while acting as a national center of excellence for  advanced technological education through its comprehensive  dissemination activities.  An electronic national clearinghouse,  published instructional materials, and two national  teleconferelces  assure wide national impact.",
