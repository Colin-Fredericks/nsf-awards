 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partial oxidation catalysis is an economically important but scientifically poorly understood  process.  The elucidation of the mechanism of partial oxidation catalysis, particularly the  activation of methane and other alkanes, forms the focus of this research project supported by  the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Model reactions carried out on oxygen covered  Rh(111) single crystal surfaces are used to probe the mechanism of the partial oxidation reaction.   High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy combined with thermal desorption  spectroscopy provide information about the mechanism and kinetics of alkane oxidation on the  Rh(111) surface as a function of oxygen coverage.  A range of methods for preparing and  examining possible radical intermediates in these reactions are employed in the studies. A better  understanding of this process could have impact on the design of catalysts for utilization of vast  methane energy reserves.    An understanding of partial oxidation catalysis, particularly the activation of methane and its  conversion to methanol or synthesis gas, could have enormous economic impact due to the large  reserves of methane available.  This research project works to develop this understanding, by  examining the kinetics and mechanisms of appropriate model catalytic systems.",
