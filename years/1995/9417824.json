 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Lutful Bhuiyan, University of Puerto Rico Piedras, is supported   by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to   continue his theoretical research on the influence of collective   interactions between colloidal particles on colloidal stability.    Modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB)  theory will be used to investigate the   importance of collective effects of all the charged species of a   colloidal solution on the interaction between two colloidal particles.   Four specific goals of the research are: 1) to adapt the MPB equation to   the situation where one or more of the species is the colloidal particle   so all interactions are treated on an equal footing; 2) to study the   interaction between colloidal particles on concentration, size, and   charge of both the colloidal particle and the simple ions; 3) determine   the effect of steric interaction with solvent molecules on   colloid-colloid interactions; and 4) to consider further development of   the MPB approach.  A fundamental understanding of the nature of interparticle forces in   highly interacting colloidal dispersions does not as yet exist.    It is   still not well understood what keeps charged colloidal particles   dispersed in water from coagulating.  Because of their unusual physical   properties colloidal materials have found widespread industrial use, and   may in the future have important device applications.  In order to design   materials with desired properties, it is necessary to understand the   detailed atomic level description of the strong interactions between   these charged particles in solution.  Bhuiyan's research is directed at a   basic theory to explain these properties.",
