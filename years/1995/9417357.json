 "awd_abstract_narration": "Self-assembled organic thiol monolayers on gold electrodes can be used to probe the details of  electron transfer from the electrode to redox couples in solution.  In this research project,  supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, insulated electrode voltammetry  will be developed by Professor Cary Miller and his students at the University of Maryland as  a method to probe electron transfer processes, taking advantage of the structure of these self-  assembled organic monolayers.  Electron coupling within the thiol monolayers will be  investigated by functional group replacement within the molecular overlayer.  The work  combines the synthesis of specific molecules to test ideas of electron transfer in these layers, as  well as the detailed electrochemical measurements needed to understand the kinetics of electron  transfer across these layers.  This information could have long range use in the design and  control of molecular electronic devices.     In order to rationally design ultra small scale electronic devices using molecular components,  a detailed understanding of electron transfer across molecular species must be developed.  This  research project begins to develop this sort of understanding by making detailed measurements  of electron transfer processes across model organic thin films, whose structure and functional  group make-up can be readily varied.",
