These  differential stations will provide data not available from the  basic DOT/DOD-managed civil GPS signal.  These data include  corrections to GPS position errors; high accuracy orbit  information; corrections for the intentional degradation of the  civil signal, ionospheric errors, and clock and ephemeris errors;  and provide integrity information.  An opportunity now exists to  optimize the usefulness of the data produced from DGPS networks for  scientific applications.  Considerations for future GPS  infrastructure include specification and standardization of  receiver equipment, testing, documentation, error reduction, real-  time data communications, analysis software development, and data  management and archiving.    To maximize the value of emerging DPGS networks for scientific  applications, the NRC/ASEB in cooperation with several other NRC  units, proposes to bring together in a workshop a select group of  scientists, engineers, and researchers, as well as representatives  from federal agencies.  The goal of the workshop will be to discuss  DGPS plans and objectives and develop options for improving  communication and coordination among the scientific DPGS users and  network operators.  A steering committee of six experts will be  appointed to develop the workshop program and oversee the  preparation of the proceedings of the workshop, which will include  a thematic summary of the discussion.    This workshop is important because it will enhance the scientific  benefit from the rapidly emerging GPS technology.",
