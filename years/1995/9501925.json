Optical pumping of interband  transitions in a quantum-well structure with circularly-polarized  laser light incident along the applied magnetic field direction  results in non-equilibrium spin polarization of electrons in the  well.  Nuclei in the materials that form the well, e.g., GaAs,  are dynamically polarized via their hyperfine coupling to the  electron spins, and their NMR signals monitor the electron spin  state in the well.  The research objectives are to map out (1)  the spin configuration of the many-particle ground state, and (2)  the elementary excitations and their energy splitting from the  ground state.  OPNMR experiments will also search for evidence of  occurrence of the Wigner crystal phase.  %%%  The proposed research will employ a new experimental technique,  \"Optically Pumped Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\" (OPNMR), to study  the fundamental quantum mechanics of the two-dimensional electron  gas (2DEG) confined in quantum-well nanostructures fabricated  from compound semiconductors such as gallium arsenide.  Optical  pumping of interband electronic transitions using circularly-  polarized laser light applied along the direction of an applied  magnetic field results in non-equilibrium polarization of the  spins of electrons in the well.  Nuclei in the semiconductor  material from which the well is fabricated are consequently  dynamically polarized through their interactions with the  electrons, and their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals  serve to monitor the state of the electron spins in the well.  The research objectives are to map out (1) the spin configuration  of the collective (many-particle) lowest energy state of the  electrons in the well as a function of the number of electrons,  and (2) the so-called elementary excita tions of the electronic  system and their energy splittings from the lowest energy state.  OPNMR experiments will also be used to search for evidence of the  so-called electron (Wigner) crystal, an exotic organization of  electrons onto a two-dimensional lattice within a heterostructure  layer, which is believed to exist under certain experimental  conditions.  ***",
