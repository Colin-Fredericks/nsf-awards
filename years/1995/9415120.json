 "awd_abstract_narration": "*** 9415120 - Balamuth  -Elementary particle physics research, utilizing terrestrial particle accelerators and astrophysical particle sources, is conducted in space to be renovated in the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Physics and Astronomy.  ARI funds will complement the University's investment in renovating  laboratories for these areas of physics.  As one of the leaders in elementary particle physics, the goal of this research is to discover the fundamental laws governing the behavior of matter and energy in the universe, including the structure of space and time.  The work requires a combination of laboratory experiments, astronomical observations, and theoretical synthesis.  Research space, built and configured for the needs of scientists in the 1950's, will be converted to modern laboratories that will house world class research and training efforts in elementary particle physics and astrophysics.  Principal components of the project are: 1) Replacement and upgrading of insufficient of nonfunctional HVAC systems; 2) Rearrangement of interior spaces to meet the challenges of modern research needs; 3) Replacement of obsolete electrical distribution systems; and 4) Provision of dedicated detector and electronics test space.  This project will provide the infrastructure necessary  for present and future faculty and students so that they can exert scientific leadership in multi-institution collaborations that characterize modern research in the disciple.  The renovations will provide the opportunity to continue a high quality research program investigating important problems in the physics to objects as small as a neutrino, or as large as the universe itself. ***",
