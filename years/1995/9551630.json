 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department's traditional advanced laboratory  experiment-based classes have been replaced with year-long  student capstone projects, with the goal of improving the  graduate school or employment readiness of the baccalaureate  students.   The subatomic physics component is meeting this  curricular change with the extension of its existing  projected-oriented program.   Nine new projects and subprojects  have been identified and studied for use in the new capstone  regime.     The capstone program in particle/nuclear physics  focuses on the study of the interaction of radiation with matter.    Each project in the program examines principles of particle  detection while providing experience in project management,  including proposal writing and results presentation.   The  projects are varied in their depth of challenge in order to  affect all senior physics students.   In completing their  projects, students are exposed to contemporary particle and  nuclear physics methods and instrumentation.   The new projects,  while self-complete, also contribute to a larger (undergraduate  research) project in which a new muon detector and flux monitor  is constructed and used for meaningful measurements.",
