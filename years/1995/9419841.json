 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419841  Nobel  The primary goals of the proposed research are to  investigate water movement across the root-soil interface  and from the root surface to the root xylem.  The focus will  be on how the constraints on radial flow in each component  of the pathway change in concert with changes in soil  moisture availability.  Structural modifications in the root  and at the root-soil interface during drought and subsequent  rewetting will be analyzed with respect to their  consequences for water uptake or loss by roots of the  monocotyledon Agave deserti and the dicotyledon Opuntia  ficus-indica.  The pathway across the root is composed of  several tissues, each with its own hydraulic conductivity  that can change in response to moisture availability and as  a consequence of root development.  The limitations on  radial water flow imposed by individual root tissues will be  investigated by measuring hydraulic conductivity for intact  and dissected root segments; the contribution of the  apoplast to the radial pathway will also be assessed by  fluorescent tracers.  Anatomical changes that occur in roots  during short-term drought (less than one month) will be  assessed along with possible changes in tissue osmotic  pressure; the importance of such changes in limiting water  flow will be anlyzed with respect to two driving forces,  hydrostatic versus osmotic pressures.  The responses of  roots to prolonged drought (four to six months) will also be  examined, with the focus on anatomical and morphological  changes that restrict water loss yet allow rapid water  uptake upon rewetting.  Roots of these and many other  species shrink during drought, as perhaps does the soil,  leading to the development of air gaps between roots and  soil.  Physical verification and measurement of air gaps  around roots will be obtained from soil thin-sections  surrounding roots, accompaied by experimental assesment of  the effects of air gaps on water movement across the root-  soil interface.  In summary, the proposed  research will  investigate how the limitations on the movement of water in  the root-soil system change with soil moisture availability,  with particular emphasis on the capability of roots to  function in drying soil.",
