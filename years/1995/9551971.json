 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university is enhancing its Artificial Intelligence in  Manufacturing (AIM) laboratory by developing an Intelligent  Factory--one of three components in the AIM laboratory.   The  other two components of the laboratory are the previously created  Artificial Intelligence (AI) Processing Center and an Intelligent  Manufacturing Cell.   Hardware acquisitions for the Intelligent  Factory include a PC-based computer with a network to serve as  factory controller, an automated storage/retrieval system, two  robotic manipulators, and two additional PC-based computers.    This equipment is being combined with hardware that includes five  robotic manipulators with PC-based controllers, a computer  controlled conveyor system, and a vision system.   The  Intelligent Factory supports two courses:  Flexible Manufacturing  Systems and Improving Manufacturing with Artificial Intelligence  Techniques.   Students use the Intelligent Factory as an  independent facility and in conjunction with the AI Processing  Center.   Through these applications, students study the  operation and control of a realistic Computer Integrated  Manufacturing environment.   All three components of the AIM  laboratory are connected via a computer network.",
