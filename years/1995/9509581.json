 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509581  Balas       The last half century has seen an increasing use of  computers insolving the complex decision problems that arise  in a modern society.The methods needed to solve many of  these problems are a fusion of ideas from Mathematics,  Computer Science and Operations Research, Linear  Programming, Integer Programming and Combinatorial  OptimizationTechniques are widely used in today's world.  Problems of production, distribution, and allocation are  routinely modeled in this way. New techniques drawing from  developments in all three disciplines are needed to solve  the ever larger problems that arise in a technologically  advanced society.  In addition, new areas of application  emerge repeatedly. For example, the recent upsurge of  activity in Computational Molecular Biology relies heavily  on Discrete Mathematics to untangle the knotty sequencing  problems that it throws up.       The knowledge needed to solve such problems transcends  the traditional boundaries of a modern university.  Researchers in Mathematics, Operations Research and Computer  Science Departments often find themselves working on similar  problems.       On the other hand the idea of training graduate  students simultaneously in all three areas has been slow to  get off the ground. Carnegie Mellon recognized this several  years ago.  Using it's internationally recognized strengths  in all three areas it responded by setting up the Ph. D.  program in Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization. A  unique feature of the program is that students are given a  thorough grounding in the foundations of all three areas  before they embark on their research.  Now nearly 30  students have taken part in the program. The quality of the  students has been excellent and the first crop of graduates  have taken up positions in major universities and research  laboratories.The program has inspired other institutions to  provide similar courses.The money from this grant will be  used to support graduate students and to provide t hem with  an environment in which they can acquire knowledge and  research skills in all three areas.",
