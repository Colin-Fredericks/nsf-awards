 "awd_abstract_narration": "9412392  Slodkowski  The problems in this proposal are concerned with polynomial   convex hulls and their applications. The proposer intends to   pursue his long term interest in polynomial hulls fibered over   the unit circle. he will concentrate especially on analyzing   the structure of polynomial hulls with non-connected fibers   and finding their new applications. He also plans to study   weak solutions of Levi equations in two or more dimensions and   their applications to description of polynomial hulls and   envelopes of holomorphy of submanifolds of n-dimensional   complex Euclidean space.  The role of mathematical analysis is to provide qualitative,   quantitative and geometric information concerning the   solutions of equations. When the equations are defined over   domains in several complex variables the approximation of   functions and solutions is complicated by the geometry of the   domain. This project studies this interplay between the   complex geometry and approximation. In particular, the project   will have application to the location of extreme values of   solutions to complex equations.  ***",
