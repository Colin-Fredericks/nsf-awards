The programs will take a literature-based approach to mathematics which helps make it possible \". . . for children to have the same authentic experiences with math that they are coming to have with language, social studies, science and the arts.\" (Read Any good Math Lately? by Whitin and Wilde).  The goal of the project is to expand the impact of the \"Reading Rainbow\" series by:    - integrating quality math-oriented books with science and literary selections into the series, and    - making quality children's math-oriented books more visible to parents, public librarians, and teachers and to engage children's interest in reading about and exploring math in the real world.     The outreach effort will develop a special math effort directed to parents, children, and teachers.  A special publication for parents and a teacher guide will be created for the new math-focused programs.  The producers will work with the Family Math Project at the Lawrence Hall of Science in training parents and children and will also direct community outreach efforts towards economically and socially disadvantaged families.  This effort will engage these families in math related activities through partnerships with community-based organizations and local public television stations involved in PBS's Ready to Learn Project.  Partnership organizations include the National Council for Teachers of Math, Girls Inc, The Connecticut Academy for Education in Mathematics, Science and Technology, EQUALS Family Math Project, and the Weekly Reader Corporation.  \"Reading Rainbow\" partnerships also have been established between three SSI's -- Louisiana, Michigan, and Ohio -- and PBS stations in those states.",
