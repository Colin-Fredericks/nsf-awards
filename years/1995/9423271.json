 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Michael B. Hall at the Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M   University is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program at NSF for ab initio theoretical studies of problems of   current interest in inorganic and organometallic chemistry, especially   homogeneous catalysis. The computational methods which are being used   involve full-gradient geometry optimization techniques for both   multiconfiguration self-consistent-field and configuration interaction   wavefunctions. The applications being made often require calculations at   the frontier of those possible and, if necessary, the existing methods   are modified and enhanced so that these calculations can be performed.   The work under this grant is focused on the study and the   characterization of four fundamental steps in catalytic reactions:   oxidative-addition; substitution; migratory-insertion; and atom transfer.   The systems being studied include models for biologically and   industrially important catalytic oxidation processes.  The work supported by this grant will help to provide the understanding   which will allow researchers to make qualitative chemical predictions,   without the need for further calculations, related to reactions involved   in biological and industrial processes. A major objective is the   discovery and prediction of systematic trends in the structures and   reactivity of inorganic and organometallic systems. In order to achieve   these objectives the systems being studied theoretically by Professor   Hall are chosen to be as close as possible to systems being studied by   experimentalists.",
