The first branch of  the work extends methods for identifying atypical cases in multiple  regression, multivariate and time series data, and for moderating their  effects on the subsequent analysis of the data.  The second branch of  the work addresses problems of methodologies for identifying structural  changes in ordered data (for example regression and multivariate data)  and for overcoming the difficulties caused by unknown parameter values.  A major application  for this work is statistical quality improvement.    Many important societal problems involve making valid inferences from  complex data sets.  The decision whether a facility is adding to the   pollution levels in the groundwater, for example, is made on the basis   of series of groundwater samples.  Analyzing these series is complicated  by the presence of apparent maverick values, which may be the result of  laboratory error or may reflect actual pollution events.  The methods   developed with this award help to recognize such values and to resolve the  issue of the true pollution levels.  Quality improvement is     of great importance - both in manufacturing and in all areas  of government and the private sector.  Pointers to quality improvement   for deterioration can be found from identifying structural changes in  series of measurements  The development of powerful easily-used  change diagnostics in this research will  lead to sounder and more reliable  ways of pinpointing the sources of change.  The work has both   methodological and computational elements.  While the computational  aspect benefits from high performance computing equipment and me thods,  the development of better computational procedures also leads to   solutions to problems currently beyond the powers of even the most  powerful computer systems.",
