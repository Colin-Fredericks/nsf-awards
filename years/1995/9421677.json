 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morphological systems are a broad class of nonlinear systems that  can provide rigorous and efficient solutions to many applications  of image and signal processing that can benefit from and most often  require the use of nonlinear analysis. Examples include multiscale  filtering, feature extraction, image segmentation, and other  geometry-based problems in computer vision. This research is  investigating a range of theoretical and applied problems  including: (1) the modeling of multiscale processing in image  analysis, image distance transforms, and signal envelope detection  using morphological systems; (2) the development of analytic tools  for these nonlinear systems both in the time/space domain and in a  new transform domain - the slope domain; and, (3) the exploration  of exciting connections of the above to physics. The unifying theme  is a collection of max-min differential/difference equations  modeling the scale or time/space dynamics of morphological systems,  and some novel nonlinear signal transforms, called slope  transforms.    Several nonlinear PDEs that model the evolution of multiscale  morphological filters are being studied. These PDEs are related to  the well-known eikonal equation of optics. Solutions based on  max-min difference equations that can compute distance transforms  are being examined. The analysis of the multiscale nonlinear PDEs  and the solution of the eikonal equation through max-min equations  constitutes a new area in nonlinear image analysis that we call  differential morphology; many applications are envisioned.   Specific research problems include the development of fast discrete  slope transforms; the study of recursive morphological systems  resulting from discretizing the nonlinear differential equations;  the design of discrete slope-selective filters for signal envelope  detection and image distance transforms; the design of analog slope  filters for D/A conversion; multiscale image analysis using  morphological PDEs; and image segmentation and gr idless image  halftoning by solving the eikonal PDE using morphological systems.",
