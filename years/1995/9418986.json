 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a program to study the geomorphic evolution  of the Dry Valleys region of the Transantarctic Mountains.  The  isotopic ages and areal distribution of volcanic ash deposits  will be used to constrain the chronology and rates of landform  development and to help quantify the age of geomorphic surfaces.  The depositional setting and degree of weathering of the ash will  also help to constrain regional paleoclimatic conditions during  and after deposition of the volcanic ash.  This work will focus  on the Quartermain Mountains, Asgaard Range, Olympus Range, and  McKelvey Valley because these regions are known to contain some  volcanic ash deposits and because they contain a variety of  geomorphic settings over a substantial elevation range.    This project will attempt to test assumptions that underlie the  hypothesis that the Dry Valleys region represents a relict, semi-  arid landscape that formed prior to build up of the continental  ice sheets during middle Miocene time and that subsequent slope  modification has been limited to minor glacial scouring  concentrated at valley heads, glacier confluences, and deep-  valley troughs.  Among these assumptions are 1) that present  geomorphic processes are ineffective denudation agents, 2) that  widespread land surfaces within tectonically uniform blocks  reflect base-level changes at the Transantarctic Mountains front,  and 3) that geomorphic landforms of the Dry Valleys that  superficially resemble box canyons, escarpments, mesas, and  buttes of desert regions in the American southwest formed by  denudation processes now operating in the Colorado Plateau.    The isotopic age information generated by this project will  provide constraints for models of geomorphic evolution in cold-  desert regions and will have implications for models of landscape  development and uplift history of the Transantarctic Mountains.  If the hypothesis of ancient semi-arid erosion followed by minor  glacial incision proves correct for the Dry Valleys re gion, then  changes in base level, as defined by isotopically dated land  surfaces in the Valleys, will provide a chronology of late  Cenozoic mountain evolution and uplift independent of  thermochronological studies that have been completed.  This is  important because the thermochronology studies, although well  suited for determining long-term uplift rates, are not well  suited to distinguishing early from late Cenozoic uplift.  The  volcanic ash data base developed in the course of this study will  also be useful for studies of the McMurdo volcanic province.",
