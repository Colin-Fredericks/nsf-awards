 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503034  Stallings       The project is to study hyperbolic groups, automatic groups,  non-positively curved triangles of groups, and related matters  involving geometric questions about group-theory.  The problem of  distinguishing non-hyperbolic automatic groups has several  interesting aspects.  There is a notion of angle between pairs of  subgroups  A,B  of a group G,  which involves the smallest length  of an expression  aba'b'a\"b\"... which is reduced and gives the  identity element of G.  This leads to interesting algorithmic  questions; in the case of free groups this relates to the Loop  Theorem.  Another algorithmic question about \"inner rank\" is  related to questions about surfaces in 3-manifolds.       Groups arise in all branches of mathematics, as sets of  symmetries, i.e. transformations which preserve structure.  The  investigator hopes to understand various properties of groups, the  classification of types of groups, and the use of group theory to  connect mathematical areas.  In geometry and topology, groups  naturally arise as subgroups of matrix groups and the fundamental  groups of spaces.  The fundamental group as defined by Poincare is  the basic ingredient in the classification of three-dimensional  manifolds, and major problems are group-theoretic.  This is  especially true in dimension three.  There is also an intrinsic  large-scale geometry inherent in an abstract group, which has led  to the recent interest in what are known as hyperbolic groups.   This leads in turn to algorithmic problems and to formal language  theory and will some day be of interest and use to computer  scientists.  The project has identified some problem areas as  described above, \"angle,\" \"inner rank,\" and so on, which are of  interest in the interaction of algebra and geometry; some progress  in these areas has been made; they are becoming active areas of  research, in particular, by the investigator and his Ph.D.  students.  ***",
