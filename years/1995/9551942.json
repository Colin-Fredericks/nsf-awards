The Bronx  location is Mercy's largest and fastest growing branch campus.  It  serves primarily minority (72%) and female (70%) undergraduates,  who must typically balance schoolwork with part-time (37%) or  full-time jobs (37%) and their family responsibilities.  The  proposed instructional lab will help provide more coherent and  better integrated teaching and learning experiences than is  currently available for these targeted majors during their required  introductory statistics course and their required course in  scientific methods.  The computer-based instruction provided by the  proposed Mobile Psychology Laboratory will include a modified  Electronic Instructional Theater component as well as a modified  Distance Learning component.  The latter will permit students to  engage in computer conferencing outside of class using Mercy's  dial-up Bulletin Board System, which is accessible around the  clock.  The proposed hardware and software will also facilitate  teaching and learning of the major stages of the research process  (hypothesis formation, scientific testing, statistical analyses,  tentative conclusions).  The proposed computer technology will be  used to enhance their communication skills, e.g., when students  write up their research reports and make oral presentations of  their findin gs.  Wide dissemination of project results is planned.",
