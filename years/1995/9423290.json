 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year project will support undergraduates  involved in research projects in molecular  biosciences.  University of Arizona (UA) undergraduates and Native  American students from other institutions will receive  support.  These students will all be part of UBRP, a large  program designed to involve undergraduates in biologically  related research.  Students apply to the program designed to  involve undergraduates in biologically related research.  Students apply to the program and once selected by a  faculty/student committee, can choose to work with any of  204 faculty sponsors, 65 of  whom conduct research in  molecular biosciences.  Once selected, students interview  prospective faculty sponsors to determine where they will  work.  This insures that students work on a project that is  of interest to them and fosters a productive working  relationship among the students, faculty and lab groups.  In  addition to the research, students participate in lab  meetings and seminars.  They receive an orientation that  covers laboratory and radiation safety training, animal care  and use, and research ethics.  In addition, the program  sponsors optional field trips, lab tours, and social events.  All students receive a monthly newsletter.  There is an  annual conference at which students present their  experimental results in poster form and students who have  their work accepted for presentation at scientific  conferences receive travel funds to attend.",
