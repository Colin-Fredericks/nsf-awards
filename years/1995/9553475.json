 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9553475  Kowel  UAH has created a multidisciplinary  doctoral program in Optical Science  and Engineering which admitted its  first students in the Fall, 1993.  This program addresses the growing  national need for advance training  in basic and applied optics. The  trend of strong integration of  optical components with electronics  is the basis of a vast new  technology. Our program was  developed to prepare students to  contribute across the broad  boundaries of traditional optics  including photonics.  The unique strengths of our program  derive from the support of the base  disciplines, physics, electrical  engineering, computer engineering,  materials science, and mechanical  engineering, as well as the strong  technology transfer activities  focused in the Center for Applied  Optics. A common facility for  research and teaching, together  with the shared doctoral degree,  provide an unusual concentration of  resources for our students. We are  working to strengthen the  cooperative nature of the program,  involving the University of Alabama  at Birmingham, with particular  focus on biomedical applications,  as well as Alabama A&M University  (a HBCU), with a focus on nonlinear  optics and optical materials.  We are requesting five NSF Graduate  Research Traineeships to support  students for the first two years of  their studies in the program.",
