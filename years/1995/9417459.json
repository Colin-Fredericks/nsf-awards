 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Krishnan Balasubramanian at the Department of Chemistry and   Biochemistry, Arizona State University,  is supported by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for theoretical   studies of the electronic structure of molecules and small clusters.   Accurate ab initio wavefunctions are being obtained for several systems,   all of which contain semi-conductor or other main group elements. The   systems being studied fall into three groups: (1) Mixed III-V, IV-V, and   II-VI clusters with up to 9 atoms. (2) Pure clusters with up to 8 atoms   formed from group III, IV, and V elements. And, (3) hydrides and halides   of group III and V elements. In this work relativistic effects are   explicitly treated because they are needed in order to be able to obtain   accurate energetic and geometric properties when the systems studied   contain heavy atoms. Examples of heavy atoms  treated in this work are   gallium, indium, lead, and selenium. Relativistic effective core   potentials are used to represent the electrons in the atomic cores in   order to make calculations of the wavefunctions tractable, especially for   the larger clusters. In order to obtain the required accuracy,   relativistic complete active space self-consistent field wavefunctions   are further correlated using multi-reference configuration interaction   and relativistic configuration interaction methods.  The work under this grant is directed toward resolving questions about a   wide range of properties of semi-conductor and main group clusters   containing heavy atoms. Clusters constitute a vital bridge between   molecules and solids. However, they also exhibit interesting and   technologically useful properties in their own right. In this project,   the systems studied have relevance for semi-conductor processing and for   chemical vapor deposition.",
