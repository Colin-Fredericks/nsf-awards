 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the Biology Department is introducing  quantitative light microscopy into the undergraduate curriculum.     The department has developed a comprehensive plan to expose  students to modern microscopy techniques with the use of a light  microscopy workstation.   This workstation exposes large numbers  of students to modern fluorescence imaging techniques to study  principles of cell and tissue organization and differentiation.    The major equipment items are an Olympus IMT-2 inverted  fluorescence microscope and Universal Imaging image analysis  system.   The Olympus IMT-2 inverted fluorescence microscope  provides a highly versatile work platform.   There are three  major component parts to the image analysis system: (1) Metamorph  Imaging System software and Pentium-based Workstation, (2)  Princeton Instruments cooled camera with software, and (3)  Textronix digital printer.   The system software runs under  Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher, making the system one of the  easiest to use, even for undergraduate students.   Metamorph's  built-in processing and analysis tools allow one to acquire an  image, then enhance its contrast, sharpen, deconvolute,  reconstruct, and measure and quantify.   Implementation of this  project involves introducing a number of new laboratories in five  different courses:  Cell Biology, Histology, Developmental  Biology, Endocrinology, and Introductory Biology.",
