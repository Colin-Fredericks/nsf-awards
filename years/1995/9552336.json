 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the decade, career opportunities in the environmental  sciences will outpace those in many other disciplines.   To  strengthen the curriculum in this area, eight univesity biology,  geology, geography, and chemistry faculty are involved in a  project to prepare students to address contemporary environmental  issues.   One such issue is the contamination of soil, water, and  marine sediments with heavy metals, especially lead which is  toxic to children at low blood lead levels.   The state-of-the-  art method of analysis employed by environmental laboratories for  low levels of heavy metals, particularly lead, is atomic  absorption spectrometry utilizing a graphite furnace.   A new  automated atomic absorption spectrometer equipped with a graphite  furnace allows collection of heavy metal data in air  particulates, river sediment, marine sediments, soils, plants,  mussels, and shrimp in courses spanning four disciplines and  ranging in difficulty from general education courses to advanced  senior level courses for majors.   The data are stored on an  environmental science database shared by natural science classes  that can be the basis for integrated studies in the form of  special projects, statistical analyses, and independent study  assignments.   The new equipment can thus be used to expose non-  science-majors to contemporary environmental issues, to prepare  undergraduates for the technical demands required of advanced  environmental professionals, and to strengthen critical thinking  from an interdisciplinary perspective.",
