 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research consists of three separate parts.  The first  involves the analysis of product design innovation and fashion  cycles using dynamic game theory.  A model of the fashion cycle  will be developed in which fashion is used as a signaling device  in a mating game.  Designers can create durable design  commodities which are used by consumers to signal and to screen  prospective partners.  In this context price and innovation,  diffusion of fashion, and conspicuous consumption behavior will  be examined.  The second part of the project focuses on the  comparison of equilibrium outcomes in dynamic games when there  are a large finite number of players and when there are a  continuum of players.  The third part involves analyzing the  participation and voting behavior in two candidate elections when  voters do not have the same information.  The conditions under  which voters will abstain form voting will be examined.  In  addition, the efficiency of elections as a mechanism to aggregate  information will be analyzed, as well as conditions under which  election outcomes are biased in favor of a minority.",
