 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503503  Shore       Shore will investigate a broad range of topics in computability  theory (recursion theory) and logic.  Included in the first area are   investigations of the structures of sets and functions ordered by different   notions of relative complexity of computation.  Particular emphasis will be   placed on the complexity structures of those sets which are effectively   enumerable, and on the most general notion of relative computability as   defined by unrestricted Turing machine computations.  Computation procedures   that place effective bounds on the access to oracle information or on the   run-time of the computations will also be investigated.  The second area   includes the study of structures representable by finite automata, decision   procedures, the analysis and development of nonmonotonic logic, concurrent   programming models, and applications of linear programming ideas and   algorithms to data structures and logic programming.  A study of the logical   and mathematical foundations of hybrid (continuous and discrete) control   theory will be conducted, as well as of the practical implementation of   algorithms.       This research project on computability is primarily concerned with  analyzing various ways of measuring the complexity of functions on the   natural numbers (0,1,2,...) and other common mathematical structures, in   terms of how hard they are to compute.  A primary goal is the study of the   relations between various notions of complexity of a function, notions   which are based on machine models of computation and other notions, such as   how hard it is to define or describe the function.  Techniques developed   here will also be applied to the study of the difficulty of proving the   existence of various mathematical objects, as well as to the relationship   between abstract proofs of existence of an object and the possibility or   difficulty of actually computing it.  Shore's project also includes   applications to logics such as (i) those designed to  model the real life   development of knowledge, taking into account the possibility  that what we think we know today will seem false tomorrow, and (ii) ones   designed to interact with real measuring devices to implement procedures to   control systems that must both react to outside stimuli and follow logical   decision procedures.  ***",
