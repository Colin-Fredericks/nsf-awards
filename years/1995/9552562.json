The applicants will add two science related episodes each week to Buscando La Belleza, the four-minute daily radio series for families that focuses on social issues, work issues, women's rights, and educational and career opportunities.  It is carried on 100 stations with a weekly cumulative audience of 2,567,000 listeners.  The new episodes will include: 52 role model interviews with Hispanic men and women who have careers in science, mathematics, and technology from technical positions not requiring a college degree to Ph.D.'s engaged in cutting edge research; 26 family involvement episodes with suggestions for parents to build their confidence in helping their children with homework, doing simple science activities with their children at home, encouraging their older children in their studies, and working with schools and community organizations; and 26 academic and career resource/success stories highlighting Hispanic students who have been successful in their pursuit of careers in science, mathematics, and technology.    The second series included under the grant is Salvemos Nuestro Planeta, a two-and-a-half minute series that focuses on environmental issues.  It currently is carried on 89 radio stations twice a week with a total weekly cumulative audience of 2,494,300.  The producers will expand the series to seven original episodes per week with five episodes focusing on science, mathematics, and technology themes:  general science literacy, environmental management and technology, computers and information technology, environmental activities for youth, and SMET career opportunities.    Outreach will consist of a national Spanish language toll free  phone number that will refer listeners to resources related to opportunities for scholarships in science and engineering, activities and resources for parents and children in science education, etc., and in some cases, connect callers to the subject of that days interview.    The PI will be Roberto Salazar who has been chief assistant to Vicente Llamas at the Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities.  He has been involved in numerous science education project for Hispanics and has a background in radio.  The Executive Producer will be Jeff Kline.  Major science consultants will be Vicente Llamas, Director of the Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities, and Estrella Triana, Hispanic Science Education Director for the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
