The few current lab  experiences in this area point to an evident curricular need for  updating the program. Modification of an existing course together  with the development and implementation of two new courses enables  the students to have meaningful hands-on experiences with molecular  biology equipment and techniques. Depending on the course level,  students will understand and do some or all of the following  procedures: isolate and visualize DNA through agarose  electrophoresis, isolate plasmids and cut with restriction enzymes,  transform bacteria, clone and subclone genes, amplify DNA, utilize  computer analysis. The molecular biology equipment associated with  this project (micropipetters, microcentrifuges, electrophoresis  apparati, UV transilluminators, PCR equipment, a computer station,  and other supporting equipment) is essential for students to  acquire the desired hands-on familiarity with modern molecular  technologies as they develop the conceptual framework of this  discipline.The course ehhancements are targeted to a large number  of future teachers, health care workers and future research  scientists.",
