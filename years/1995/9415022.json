 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF award to John Hopkins University will be utilized to redesign and  completely renovate facilities for the Biochemistry Department in the School of  Hygiene and Public Health, east Baltimore, MD.  The School, the first public health  school in the Unites States, offers multiple programs in the basic biological and  environmental sciences and provides leadership in biochemical and biotechnological  research and education. The Biochemistry department is oriented towards studies of  fundamental biological problems which are carried out at the interface of biology and  chemistry.  Fundamental chemical, biochemical, molecular biological, structure,  biophysical and genetic approaches are stressed in order to understand the  mechanisms of biological processes in experimentally-accessible systems.         NSF support will be matched with institutional funds to redesign and renovate  decaying laboratories on three floors of the Hygiene building, the core of which was  constructed in 1926.  Building additions were constructed in 1963 and 1968.  The  original building was last renovated approximately 40 years ago; the additions have  not been renovated since construction.  The three-year renovation project will correct  research space which is poorly configured in very small laboratories, inhibiting  spontaneous interactions, communication and intellectual exchange among researchers.   Centralized instrumentation rooms facilities will be constructed.  Ten additional  chemical fume hoods, a cold room, and vented solvent cabinets will be installed, as  will new casework, including benchtops which are resistant to concentrated acids and  bases, organic solvents, and radioactive fluids.         The renovations will have immediate impact on the ten current faculty and will  be a major resource in attracting two new faculty.  The new laboratories will facilitate  more training opportunities for graduate students, as bench space will be greatly  increased through the redesign effort.  Over the next f ive years, the department will  have 65 graduate students, 50 postdoctoral fellows and 15 undergraduates who will be  part of a critical mass of researchers working in the area of enzyme mechanisms and  protein structure and function -- areas critical to leadership in the next stage of  biotechnology.",
