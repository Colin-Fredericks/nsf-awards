This  research is in support of the LIGO (Laser Interferometer  Gravitational-Wave Observatory) Project and of the corresponding  interferometric gravitational-wave-detection project in Japan:   theorists need to compute, from general relativity, the gravitational  waveforms produced by such binaries for use as templates in the  analysis of the interferometer data.        The Caltech group has great expertise in what types of calculations  need to be done and how to relate the results of those calculations  to the planned observations; Caltech also has moderate expertise in  the calculational techniques.  The Kyoto group has greater expertise  and experience than the Caltech group in two of the principal  calculational techniques: the theory of perturbations of massive  black holes, and numerical simulations of the final coalescence.   By combining these expertises, the two groups can achieve a  deeper understanding and more rapid progress than can either  group alone.  ***",
