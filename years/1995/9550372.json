Outreach for them is being  viewed as a interaction between public needs and interests and the  university.  Leadership will be provided by a committee of  university faculty and an advisory board consisting of external  university museum and science education professsionals will meet  with project directors twice during the year.  Together they will  examine the regional science education needs, the existing public  education activities at UCD, and investigate the potential for  establishing a comprehensive informal science program.  Among other  things this will include the coalescing of various scientific  collections (geology, entomology, anthropology, the botanical and  arboretum collections) and their respective independent educational  programming into a regional science education network.  Advisors  will include members of the UCD faculty and administrators as well  as individuals representing external university museum and science  education experts.",
