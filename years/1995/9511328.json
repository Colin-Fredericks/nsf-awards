 "awd_abstract_narration": "Differences in behavior between male and female animals are  reflected in structural differences within the brain.  The  hypothalamus is a brain region where there is strong ilteraction  between hormones and the brain, and these neuroendocrine events are  very important during development.  Nerve cells, or neurons, often  are clustered into groups called nuclei.  Besides neurons, the  brain is packed with cells called glial cells, which have a variety  of functions that modulate neural development and activity.  This  project asks novel questions on whether glial cells in a nucleus of  the hypothalamus are sexually differentiated during a neonatal  \"critical period.\"  Cellular marking techniques and molecular  biology are used to explore cellular changes in morphology and gene  expression in these glial cells in response to steroid hormones.   Similar techniques will be used to localize sites of membrane  receptors for steroids, to determine whether the steroid action is  directly on glial cells, or instead is an indirect influence via  steroid-concentrating neurons.   Results will be important for  developmental neuroscience as well as neuroendocrinolgy, and will  help understand how the basic structure of the brain is related to  behavior.",
