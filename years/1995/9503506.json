 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503506  Connelly    This award supports a 24-month Science and Technology Agency  of Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. J. Christopher  Connelly of the Department of Computer Science at Duke  University.  During his fellowship, Dr. Connelly will be  resident at the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL) of the  Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) within  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in  Tsukuba, Japan.  Dr. Connelly will work with Drs. Satoshi  Hirano and Michiharu Tsukamoto of the Distributed Systems  Group at the Electrotechnical Laboratory implementing and  evaluating various resource and locality management  techniques under both simulated and real environments.    As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Connelly will have the  opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and  equipment at the ETL while contributing to the overall  research effort.  ETL has a large number of research  machines available for systems work.  The Distributed  Systems Group also collaborates with Dr. Yuetsu Kodama's  computer architecture group and has access to the  experimental dataflow machines under development.  The  availability of these machines will provide Dr. Connelly an  opportunity to study implementation issues and gain  experience working on real systems. Therefore, this proposal  fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge through an international  collaboration.  ***",
