Requiring minimum reconfiguration to switch between different  experiments, the system can be used to demonstrate a variety of  concepts, such as laser-induced fluorescence, atomic and molecular  spectroscopy, Doppler broadening, photodissociation, radiative  lifetime, Boltzmann distribution, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and  computerized data acquisition.  Six new experiments have been  designed around this setup for incorporation into upper-level  physical chemistry, biochemistry, analytical chemistry, and  instrumentation laboratories.  In addition, a program of original  research projects for majors has been developed based on the setup.  The project can serve as model for schools wishing to modernize  their curriculum in a broad, yet cost-effective way.  Laboratory  \"handouts\" and descriptions of experiments and student research  projects will be generated during the project and disseminated in  journals, meetings, and on the Internet.",
