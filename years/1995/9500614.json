 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project proposes the development of a novel source of ultra-intense, ultrashort pulsed electromagnetic radiation for time-resolved terahertz (Thz) spectroscopy.  This table-top radiation source will emit subpicosecond electromagnetic pulses with Thz bandwith and gigawatt (GW) peak power.  The technique consists of using an amplified femtosecond laser beam to illuminate a large-aperture semiconducting emitters, and to generate electromagnetic radiation produced  by the rapid current transients due to optical injection of  free carriers into the static electric fields associated with the semiconductor surfaces and interfaces.  Since the energy carried by submillimeter-wave pulses is derived mainly from the electrostatic energy capacitively stored at the surface rather than from the incident laser energy, the total energy of the radiation can well exceed the incident of the laser beam. The academic  proposal results from a need to develop a new curriculum for the Optical Physics Program at  Rensselear. A pilot program is being developed to improve student learning and motivati on through  computer-based interactive teaching using graphics, multi-media, numerical simulations, and  hands-on  experiments.  The proposed Advanced Optoelectronic Laboratory for undergraduates will be furnished  with state-of-the-art equipment and instrumentation.  A computer-assisted Modern Optics Teaching Room  is under construction.  Undergraduate student research participation is strongly emphasized to tightly  couple experimental and class work activities.",
