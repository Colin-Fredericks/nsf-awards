 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554467  Belgarde        This proposal is to fund the High Plains Rural Systemic  Initiative (HPRSI). The Turtle Mountain Community College is  serving as the fiscal agent for a coalition of 17 tribally  controlled colleges in a five-state region of the Upper Great  Plains that includes Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South  Dakota, and Wyoming.    The initiative has four major components: 1) Reservation  Initiatives, that will establish a process to increase the native  cultural knowledge and content into the science and mathematics  curriculum; 2) Technology Development, to promote the development  and use of technology as a teaching tool by establishing networks  across the region; 3) Partnership Development, to increase the  connections between RSI school and all interested stakeholders;  and 4) Commissioned Studies, a special initiative to support the  Reservation Initiatives component by providing teachers and  faculty members an opportunity to research and develop viable  teaching models for tying science and mathematics education to  culturally appropriate materials and methodologies for systemic  change.    The Reservation Initiatives component and the Commissioned  Studies are viewed as the \"seedbed\" to begin the process of  change at each of the 18 sites involved in the HPRSI (17  colleges, plus 1 reservation in Wyoming that is not served by a  college). It is important to acknowledge the differences among  these tribal communities, yet there are themes that provide a  common ground in their approach to educational reform, such as:  understanding the cultural behaviors in children and adults in  order to facilitate a higher level of learning; knowledge and  understanding of Native/indigenous knowledge in science,  mathematics and technology; acknowledging and utilizing the  wisdom and knowledge of native elders and other cultural  expertise to promote the integration of the cultural knowledge  base into a challenging science and mathematics.    The High Plains Rural Systemic Initiati ve will promote systemic  change in its five-state region by providing program  coordination, staff support, and program assessment that takes  into account both science, mathematics, and technology subject  matter and the cultural knowledge of the respective tribal group.    During the first year the HPRSI will sponsor six Reservation  Initiatives at the Sinte Gleska University, South Dakota, Dull  Knife College, Montana; Nebraska Indian College, Nebraska; Turtle  Mountain Community College, North Dakota; and the Wind River  Reservation in Wyoming.  The activities will improve curriculum  and instruction for science and mathematics in grades K-14 in  collaboration with comprehensive initiatives in the 5 states;  including the AMP program at Montana State University; the  Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota SSIs; and other reform  initiatives.",
