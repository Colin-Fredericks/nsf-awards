Temperature  dependent oxygen relaxation phenomena will  also  be  examined in detail. An objective is to establish any link between  these   phenomena   and   photo-induced  superconductivity.   The  functional    dependence   of   the   superconductor   transition  temperature  and  the electronic density of  state  in  fullerene  superconductors   such  as  K3C60  and  Ru3C60   will   also   be  investigated.  The project will focus on the pressure  dependence  of  the  transition  temperatures  as  well  as  the  Pauli  spin  susceptibility. This project is devoted to a fundamental study of  superconductivity,  however,  the results  may  be  of  technical  interest  in  the  context of pressure  effects  on  high-Tc  and  related materials.  %%%  In  a typical high-temperature superconductor, approximately half  of  the  constituent  atoms are oxygen. These  atoms,  via  there  arrangement  in  the crystal lattice, sensitively  influence  the  temperature  at  which a material becomes a superconductor.  This  project  is devoted to the study of the oxygen atoms,  and  their  ordering  (arrangement)  in the high-Tc  materials  lattice.  The  materials  will be studied as a function of both temperature  and  pressure  (these  are important thermodynamic variables  for  the  high-Tc  materials). The methods will also be applied to  another  interesting superconductor material: \"fullerenes\", which  contain  potassium  or  rubidium. The experiments,  which  probe  how  the  conducting properties of the materials vary with temperature  and  pressure,  will  yield information that will be  of  considerable  interest  to  theorists. The project is of a fundamental  nature,  but  may  have technical relevance if it leads to new  routes  to  higher temperature superconductors.  ***",
