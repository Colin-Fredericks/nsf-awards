 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316947  VanVolkenburgh       The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Van Volkenburgh proposes to  investigate the cellular mechanism of auxin-induced proton  excretion in protoplasts from Avena coleoptiles and tobacco  plants.  The goal of this research is to determine how the  hormone, auxin, activates the ATP-dependent proton-pump in  plasma membranes of growing cells.  This hormone stimulates  cell enlargement in plants, and plays a fundamental role in  regulating development during the plants life cycle.  It is  hypothesized that this ligand initiates cascades of cellular  events that lead to pump activation, proton excretion,  membrane hyperpolarization, solute accumulation and cell  growth.  Electrophysiological techniques, primarily whole  cell patch clamp methods will be used to determine the  possible roles of suspected components of signal  transduction cascades leading to changes in ion flux across  the plasma membrane.  Cytoplasmic contents will be  equilibrated with the solution in the patch pipette  containing either substances that might initiate ion flux in  the absence of auxin, or substances that might block the  response to auxin.  The pH and pCa of the cytoplasm will be  manipulated to determine the effect of these ions of the  auxin response.  These experiments will provide direct  evidence concerning the role of cytoplasmic components in  auxin induced proton excretion.  %%%  Protoplasts will be isolated from the known auxin-sensitive  tissue, the Avena coleoptile, and from tobacco mesophyll  which reportedly shows an unusually rapid response to auxin.  Protoplasts will be characterized for responsiveness to  auxin by measurement of auxin-induced protoplasts swelling.  The relationship between swelling and proton excretion will  be determined.  The effect of auxin on the membrane  potential of tobacco leaf cells will be compared to that of  coleoptiles using microelectrode techniques.  Both cell  types will be investigated further with patch clamp  experiments, and the results will confirm  or reject the  reports of auxin effects on tobacco protoplasts.  The  results of these experiments will serve as foundation for  further biotechnological manipulation of vascular plants.  ***",
