 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9420750  Jong    This award renews partial support of a large collection of yeasts and fungi maintained by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).  The collection currently consists of approximately 26,000 strains representing in excess of 6,500 species and 1,500 genera, and includes a wide variety of fungi and yeasts used in genetic, medical and agricultural research as well as strains needed for production of food, pharmaceuticals and other chemicals.  Though large, the collection represents less than 10% of the known species of these organisms.  Currently, about 500 new strains are placed in the collection each year.  On request and for a small charge, the ATCC provides researchers, teachers and industrial users a sample of any member of the collection; in the most recent year, over 13,000 such samples were provided.  Periodically, the ATCC also publishes information about of the collection, including names and properties of the strains, as well as limited information of use in culturing the organisms.  Such information is also made available through electronic media such as the Internet.  ***",
