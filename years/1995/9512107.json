 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research builds on a previous project, \"Property  Rights and Land Use on the Brazilian Frontier\", by examining the  circumstances under which violence occurs in providing property  rights to land in the Amazon and its economic impact on land  values, land use and investment, and tenure.  This is an  important topic because secure land tenure increasingly is viewed  as an important condition for investment and how natural  resources are ultimately exploited, particularly forests and  biodiversity in developing countries.  The question arises, what  policies will provide tenure routinely to support economic  development and when is the process likely to lead to conflict  and violence with the dissipation of economic rents and over  exploitation of natural resources?  For a people who are poor by  most standards and for a region with rich natural resources,  tenure policies and their potential link to violence in the  Amazon is a critical issue in need of further scientific study.    This project involves collecting and analyzing two unexploited  sources of data on violence and land tenuring.  Using these data  along with other census data, the interaction among violence,  land value, tenure, and investment will be examined.  The  analysis will involve a two stage econometric technique that has  been developed to examine the simultaneous relationships among  land value, tenure, investment, and violence.  Additional data  will also be collected  from secondary sources on policy  formation regarding Amazon settlement and tenuring.    In addition, land claimants will be surveyed in a region which  enjoyed major government subsidies for ranching and also  experienced the most deaths from violent conflict over land  between 1970-1985.  These subsidies are important because they  significantly raised expected land rents and may have encouraged  rapid and conflicting settlement of the region by both ranchers  and by small claimants or squatters.  Moreover, land agencies  responsible for titling, may  not have provided secure title to  land in a timely fashion. which would have added to chaotic and  over exploitation of the land and its natural resources.  ***                                      From these surveys and the analysis of the results, we can  determine the conditions under which violence over property  rights to land occurs and its impact on land value and  investment.                           Tailandia will provide a time-series data set on settlers  (tenure, plot size, land value, investment, age, sex, education  and other socio-economic characteristics, distance to market,  wealth) from 1992 through 1996/1997 that will be valuable to  other researchers. We already have assembled survey data for six  sites for 1992-93 for 249 small holders. The resurvey of part of  this group will allow us to observe changes in turnover and  consolidation, investment, and land value. With increased  economic growth in Brazil in general, we expect greater activity  in the Amazon.    The Amazon in Brazil is still largely unsettled and covered with  forest. Recent estimates from land satellite imagery indicate  that approximately 10 percent of the Brazilian Amazon is  deforested. It is thus not too late for policy to affect the fate  of much of the region. Much has been written about the settlement  of the Amazon and the attendant conflict associated with it. What  is lacking is documentation as to where and when conflicts arose  and an analysis of the determinants and impact of violence. The  research team has developed skills and knowledge of the region,  tenuring policies, primary and secondary data sources, and survey  technqiues.",
