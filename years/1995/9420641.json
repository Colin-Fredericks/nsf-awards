 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420641  This analysis of the dynamics of a stable atmospheric  boundary layer is based on a history of antarctic katabatic  wind studies and the principal investigator's work on  boundary layer dynamics at South Pole Station.    Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain a number of  consistently observed features of katabatic winds.  These  include cold drainage flows driven by radiative cooling,  warm surface temperatures, and downward mixing of cold air  without depleting the negative buoyancy driving the flow.  These hypotheses, reasonable when considered individually,  have not been proven quantitatively in an integrated manner.    This study will use high resolution models to simulate these  flows in realistic topography, using conditions derived from  the fairly extensive number of analytical studies that  currently exist in the published literature.  A regional  hydrostatic model containing a high resolution boundary  layer will be used to study relationships among the  occurrence and strength of these events, the synoptic  setting, regional radiative cooling rates, and regional  geomorphological characteristics.  A very high resolution  compressible model will be applied to a single valley to  simulate details of the flow's evolution, interaction with  topography, and exchange of energy within the atmosphere and  with the underlying surface.  ***",
