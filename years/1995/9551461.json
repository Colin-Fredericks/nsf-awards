 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biology laboratory instruction must be changed from a \"cookbook\"  approach to one that emulates activities of a scientist doing  science.   This project uses a student research video portfolio  to improve biology laboratory instruction by encouraging  exploration and investigation and by stimulating interest.   With  the proper environment, students have the time to analyze their  work, communicate ideas and concepts, and develop cooperation  with colleagues.   A phase contrast microscope and video camera  system are used to create a video tape record, after which a  computer interfaced with video equipment is used to edit the tape  and insert captions, labels, and text.   The purpose is to create  a minidocumentary of the biological investigation which can be  used for study, assessment of the experiment, and evaluation of  the student's progress in a particular course.   This research  video portfolio plan affects all the biology and health science  majors as well as summer programs for public school students.    This plan is revolutionizing the way science is taught at the  college: biology laboratories are becoming a place for student  self-learning and freedom to explore science.",
