 "awd_abstract_narration": "A statistical analysis of the properties of the low-speed flow  state of the earth's plasma sheet is approved.  The low flow state  plasma sheet (i.e., the quiet-time plasma sheet), is defined as the  complementary of the bursty bulk flow event (BBF event) state,  previously studied by the PI.  The low flow state is the most  probable state of the flow in the plasma sheet as it comprises 92-  95% of the available plasma sheet datasets.  This flow state  possesses an average flow pattern that can be explained in terms of  a 2-fluid picture of the plasma sheet.  That flow pattern will be  mapped on the ionosphere by use of current magnetic field models,  and the dependence of that pattern on the IMF sector will be  examined.      The non-BBF flows have a variance that is many times larger than  the average flow speed in the plasma sheet and persist even during  low AE conditions.  The unsteadiness of the flow may allow  convection in the plasma sheet to proceed, contrary to the pressure  balance inconsistency argument.  Thus the flow variability under  different geomagnetic conditions, and in different locations on the  X-Y plane will be studied as well as the correlation between  earthward convection and flow variability.  The flow variability  will be incorporated in a qualitative model of the plasma sheet  equilibrium.    The theory-guided statistical analysis of the quiet plasma sheet  flow field aspires to characterize the basic properties of the  ground state of the plasma sheet and its relevance to global  magnetospheric circulation.",
