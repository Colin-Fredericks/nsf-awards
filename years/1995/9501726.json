 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an intimate relationship between the algorithms used in  communication and magnetic storage systems, the integrated circuits  (ICs) which implement the algorithms, and the system performance  which results.  As systems increase in complexity, trade-offs and  innovations need to be made at all levels of a system design in  order to drive system/circuit performance to approach fundamental  limits. This research is pursuing teaching and research plans which  have the goal of developing students into engineers prepared to  make significant and important technical contributions to the  development of high performance communication and magnetic storage  systems.    On the side of teaching, the goal is to develop a curriculum which  encourages students to make connections between both the  theoretical and practical aspects of electrical engineering. The  curriculum needs formal methods to bring out the synergy that  exists between these two aspects of their field. On the side of  research, the fundamental theme is to examine algorithms and  architectures important in communications applications, identify  performance or speed limitations of conventional implementations of  the algorithms and architectures from an IC implementation  perspective, develop ways in which modifications may result in  implementation advantages, and prototype the new approaches in  order to demonstrate its potential advantages. Proposed projects  include the development of analog, digital, and mixed-signal ICs  for wireless satellite and infra-red, wired LAN, and magnetic disk  read channel applications.",
