 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics has recently revised the requirements  for the BA degree in physics in order to improve the preparation  of students planning careers in biological physics,  bioengineering, radiology, health physics, or medicine.   A  reduced number of physics courses permits the student to prepare  for the above disciplines by taking elective chemistry and  biology courses.   To strengthen their preparation, the  department has added a Physics of Medicine and Biology course.    This project funds supporting laboratory experiments at each  level of our curriculum.   In the General Physics Laboratory, an  experiment on the fundamentals of ultrasound detection is being  added.   This experiment is followed in the Intermediate  Laboratory with experiments on ultrasonic imaging and  velocimetry.   In the Advanced Laboratory, experiments exploring  the fundamentals of pulsed NMR are being added.   After doing  these experiments, the students go to the Medical School for  demonstrations and some measurements with clinical ultrasonic and  MRI instrumentation.   The addition of these experiments, and the  changes in our curriculum, will better prepare students for  career opportunities in physics-related fields.",
