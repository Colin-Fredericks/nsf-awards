 "awd_abstract_narration": "Matching funds are requested from the National Science  Foundation to set up a cell/tissue culture facility for use  by faculty investigators and trainees in the Department of  Organismal Biology and Anatomy of The University of Chicago.  During the past decade, this department has made major  studies in applying the techniques of molecular biology to  problems of organismal biology, and in training students to  do likewise. Conspicuous by their absence from these  developments have been cell/tissue culture techniques.  Absence of suitable facilities in the building prevents  departmental researchers from analyzing gene expression in  cultured cells and performing physiological investigations.  Use of facilities elsewhere on campus necessitates transport  of cells/tissues in culture over long distances and outside  in inclement weather, which is incompatible with the  proposed research. Accordingly, funds are sought to acquire  facilities on site. Proposed research applications include  (1) examination of possible molecular chaperone activity of  a heat shock protein, hsp70; (2) study of gene expression  associated with differentiation in a leech model; (3)  elucidation of temperature-sensitive regulation of  transcription in a natural model (the Ldh-B locus of the  fish Fundulus); (4) investigation of effects of aqueous flow  regime on stem cell differentiation in demosponges and  development of an experimental model for optimizing fluid  flow in biological systems; (5) examination of neural bases  of learning in a brain explant model. The proposed facility  would not only permit these projects to be carried out, but  also serve as a springboard for educating all departmental  personnel about the utility, promise, and practice of  cell/tissue culture. To this end, the PIs would conduct  regular workshops whose participant would include  departmental personnel and local secondary school  instructors.",
