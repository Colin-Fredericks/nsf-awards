Scientific sessions will compare and contrast the sensory and locomotor systems in diverse prokaryotes, focusing on each fundamental step in their signal transduction pathways: (a) transmembrane signaling by chemo- and photo-receptors; (b) signal transduction by intracellular phosphorylation cascades; (c) sensory control of cellular motility and gene expression; and (d) the mechanics of cell motility.    The meeting format will include approximately 70 oral presentations and 80 posters, allowing virtually all laboratories working in this rapidly moving field to present their key findings.  The requested funds are for students expenses only.  In previous years the meeting has provided an important forum for emerging concepts and generalizations concerning bacterial sensing and motility, and has presented the first molecular details co ncerning the structure and function of a family of signaling proteins that are pervasive in prokaryotic organisms and now are turning up in eukaryotic cells as well. ***                           ;                                                                Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       Lawrence R.
