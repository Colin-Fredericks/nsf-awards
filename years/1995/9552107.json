The laboratory engages students in an integrated  application of refraction seismology, gravity and magnetic anomaly  analysis, paleomagnetic study, major and trace element  geochemistry, and geochronology to determine the evolution and  present geometry of the Mesozoic rift basin in which the College is  located.  These \"hands-on\" laboratory investigations complement and  invigorate the lecture portion of the syllabus where the class  takes up the more generalized theory, implications, and  applications of these earth systems and disciplines.  The equipment  is being used to conduct the refraction seismology and gravity  survey portions of the integrated study.  All other facilities or  equipment required for this undertaking are available either at the  College or in the laboratories of the University of Massachusetts  nearby.  The equipment will also be effectively used in the  Department's Environmental Geology course and by majors undertaking  senior independent research.",
