Tsou has been chosen because the range of  syllable onset consonant clusters that it permits is rarely  attested in other languages. This makes Tsou an ideal language  for the main goal of this study: determining the role that  perception plays in shaping syllable structure.            It has been proposed that syllable structure is due in large  part to demands that the perceptual system places on language.  It is the hypothesis of this study that speakers of Tsou produce  the exceptional syllable onset clusters in such a way as to  maximize the cues to the presence of both the first and second  consonant.            To test this hypothesis, an acoustic and a perceptual study  will be carried out in Taiwan. The acoustic study will examine in  detail the characteristics of consonant release bursts and  formant transitions of Tsou consonant clusters as well as  singleton consonants.            A set of perceptual experiments will follow up the results  of the acoustic studies. The stimuli will be made using digital  editing. The experiments will include stimuli made by excising  the first burst in a consonant cluster, and splicing a burst from  a cluster into a position preceding a singleton burst. The  experiments will use a forced choice paradigm in which the  listeners will be asked to identify the stimuli as a word with a  simple onset or a word with a cluster onset. The goal of such  experiments is to test the hypothesis that the release burst  alone contains sufficient information to alter the percept on the  part of the listener. It will also determine the degree to which  formant transitions contribute to the consonant percept in onset  clusters.",
