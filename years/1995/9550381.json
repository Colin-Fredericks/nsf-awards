 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component of this project is designed to develop an  interdisciplinary approach to creating geologic hazards potential  maps in areas at high risk for slope failure.  The study will  integrate geological observations, geotechnical materials testing,  and geographic information systems (GIC) analysis of major paleo-  landslides within the Huntsville, Alabama city limits.  Concerns  about the potential for catastrophic slope failures in this and  other parts of the southeastern US has been heightened by recent  delineation of a belt of active seismicity in Eastern Tennessee.   Meaningful analysis of the potential risks will require both the  short-term, pragmatic considerations of geotechnical engineering  and longer-term geologic understanding of natural systems.    The interactive activities will promote dialogue between geologists  and geological engineers.  Activities include supervision of Earth-  systems based geology laboratory, already successfully implemented  at the investigator's home institution; leading a graduate course  on pedagogical strategies for geology teaching assistants; and  conducting a graduate seminar on a topic of mutual interest to  geologists and geological engineers.",
