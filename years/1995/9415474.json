 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA typing has increasingly become a common source of forensic information in the United States and is currently used by federal, state and local crime laboratories. Recently, controversy has grown over how to interpret DNA evidence scientifically.  The debate about this issue must be resolved if DNA typing is to be used appropriately and if confusion in the courts is to be avoided.  The National Research Council is in the process of beginning a study to address the central questions, performed by a committee of distinguished experts.  The committee will include expertise in appropriate subdisciplines of statistics and population genetics, with additional expertise in molecular biology, forensic science, law, and social science, and other areas as necessary.  The study will emphasize statistical and population genetics issues relating to forensic DNA evidence and will pay particular attention to how such evidence is used in the courts.  The  committee will review relevant studies and data, especially those that have accumulated since the 1992  NRC report, DNA Technology and Forensic Science, and will  seek outside input from appropriate  experts.  The committee will meet five times during the course of the study.  The target date for  publication of the report is approximately seven months from the project start date.",
