Research is planned in abstract                            gambling theory (a particular formulation of stochastic control),  stochastic games, and the foundations of Bayesian statistics.  Part of the research aims for a better understanding of a new  algorithm which can be used to calculate the optimal reward  function in gambling theory and also to calculate the value  function for a large class of two-person, zero-sum    stochastic  games. Research is also planned on a class of many-person,     noncooperative games that can be used to study questions in the  theory of money and financial institutions. Finally, research is  planned on certain    problems in the foundations of statistical  inference.   Research is     planned on fundamental questions about  how to make optimal decisions     through time in the presence of  uncertainty. Abstract gambling theory     treats problems in which a  single decision maker seeks to control a     process so as to reach a  desired objective. In stochastic games, two or     more decision act  to control a process and may have opposing interests.     The  mathematical theory of such problems is quite technical, but     solutions are of interest in many areas including business,  economics    and operations research.",
