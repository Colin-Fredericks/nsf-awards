The equipment requested;  a Wescore Osmometer, Oxygen electrodes, monitors and chart  recorders, and a Sorvall RC-5C Centrifuge with a rotor adds a new  and advanced element to an already existing upper-level Plant  Physiology lab. In depth studies in Transpiration and Water  Relations, Photosynthesis, Enzyme Kinetics and Protein Purification  are now possible using the equipment requested. South Texas plants  are emphasized so that the students in this course preparing for  careers as high school teachers may better relate to, and  understand, the environment around them. The equipment is also  being used in Introductory Botany laboratory exercises, Cell  Biology labs and extensively, by undergraduate students, doing  directed research in the PI's laboratory.",
