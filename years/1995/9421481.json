The purpose of the workshop is to bring together 30-40  scientists with expertise in the Antarctic and comparable  ecosystems in Arctic and temperate regions to discuss the  approaches to management of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in an  environmentally responsible manner.  Workshop discussions will  encompass the conduct of research, environmental monitoring, and  potential effects of tourism.  The impetus for holding this  workshop includes:  (1) assessing the potential environmental  impact of the on-going research programs in the dry valleys, (2)  the current ratification process for the Environmental Protocols  of the Antarctic Treaty System, and (3) the arrival in 1992 of  the first tourists to visit the McMurdo Dry Valleys.  The major  objectives of the workshop will be to develop: (1) an ecosystem-  based approach for managing the conduct of scientific activities  in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, (2) a code of environmental conduct  for scientists working in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, (3)  recommendations for an environmental monitoring program,  including suitable indicators, that can address project specific  impacts and cumulative impacts, and (4) recommendations for  management plans for regions within the dry valleys or for the  McMurdo Dry Valleys as a whole.  In addition to scientists from  the United States, numerous foreign scientists will be invited.     The workshop will be structured to allow participants an  opportunity to provide input and discussion on each topic.  A  report will be published and distributed following the workshop.",
