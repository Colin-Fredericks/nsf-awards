 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9550452  The purpose of the project is to develop a mathematical  environment for students with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).   These students tend to be easily distracted and tend to disrupt  the typical classroom, thus they tend to be several years behind  their appropriate grade level.  For this reason, few ADD students  enter careers in mathematics and science.  The project will  include the following:  (1)  Adaptation and/or design of  innovative instructional and motivational mathematics activities  specifically for students K-12 with ADD.  Particular emphasis  will be placed on the use of technology, writing, cooperative  learning, experimentation, and manipulatives in mathematics  education.  The NCTM standards will be applied throughout.  (2)   Training of teachers in the use of these techniques and making  materials readily available for classroom use.  By meeting these  objectives, the project will benefit students with ADD by  accelerating the development of their mathematical capabilities  and putting them on a level with their peers.  This improvement  also should change their attitude toward the study of mathematics  so that it ceases to be a chore and becomes more an interest.   Implementation of this project is intended to result in  methodology for teaching mathematics to children with ADD so that  students with this problem will have better educational outcomes.",
