 "awd_abstract_narration": "9413017  Serio   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is to support continued research on development of  a flue gas monitoring system for determination of the potential  air contaminants in emissions of gases from combustion processes.  The system is based on the application of principles derived from  the use Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy in monitoring  nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine in an on-line, diagnostic  instrument that can be used for the determination of the  composition of effluent gas streams.  The proposal leading to  this recommendation results from successful completion of a Phase  I, Small Business Innovation Research project in which the technical feasibility of the  concept proposed was demonstrated.  In Phase II, the investigator  plans on assembling a working field prototype and to validate its  precision, accuracy and stability during operation in full-scale  combustion systems as a step toward determination of the  concept's commercial feasibility.   Exhaust gases from combustion of fossil fuels and from combustion  of solid wastes results in the production of byproduct gases that  pollute air into which they are discharged.  Results of this  project are expected to determine the commercial feasibility of  producing an instrument that could be used to monitor nitrogen  and sulfur oxides and potentially toxic gases in the exhausts  from combustion processes.",
