The  collaborators will conduct research on atomic-scale surface structures  of ordered surface alloys obtained by depositing alkali metals on  transition and noble metals.  These surface materials are of  considerable interest in such important technologies as catalysis and  magnetic superlattice properties.  The main technique to be used will  be low energy electron diffraction (LEED.)    The sample preparations and LEED intensity measurements will be  carried out at Hokkaido University in the laboratory of Professor  Tochihara who is particularly well-experienced with complex alkali  metal adsorption structures.  The structural analysis of the measured  data will be performed by Dr. Van Hove in Berkeley.  By combining  these expertises, the two groups can achieve a deeper understanding  and more rapid progress than can either group alone.  Therefore, this  proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
