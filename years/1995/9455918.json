 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ChemLinks Coalition is undertaking a five-year project to  change the way students learn chemistry, increase scientific  literacy for all students taking chemistry, and promote the process  of educational reform.  In collaboration with the ModularChem  Consortium, faculty are developing, testing, and disseminating  modular course materials that use active and collaborative  approaches to learning.  These materials, focused on the first two  years of the chemistry curriculum, start with interdisciplinary  questions important to students and to society (the molecular basis  of life, the environment, technology), and in answering them  develop an appreciation of how science is actually done.  This  approach is designed to reach a broader student audience more  effectively than do traditional courses, an audience that includes  students who are members of groups traditionally under-represented  in science, non-science majors, and those taking chemistry as a  supporting course, as well as chemistry majors.  By providing a  model for students preparing for careers in teaching, this approach  has an impact on Teacher Preparation Programs.  Collaboration among  faculty from different disciplines and a number of institutions  supports and reinforces those who want to make changes.  These  leading liberal arts colleges (Beloit, Carleton, Colorado,  Grinnell, Hope, Kalamazoo, Knox, Lawrence, Macalester, Rhodes,  Spelman, St. Olaf, Wooster) and research universities (Chicago,  Washington - St. Louis) already have experience working together on  chemistry curricular reform.  An alliance with the Advanced  Technology Environmental Education Center's coalition of 2-year  institutions assures an impact on Advanced Technology Education  Programs.  By using the extensive Project Kaleidoscope network to  promote reform, the ChemLinks Coalition involves a much larger and  more diverse group of institutions in making systemic and  sustainable changes in undergraduate chemistry education.",
