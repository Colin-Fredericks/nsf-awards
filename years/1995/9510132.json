A wealth of fascinating   physical  phenomena  awaits  investigation, such as  pinned charge  density  waves  at  the  surface  of potassium, pre-martensitic surface transitions on lithium,  surface  reconstructions such as the missing row reconstruction  on  a  beryllium  surface,  oscillatory structural  transformations  in  thin  films,  and  collective  excitations in \"designed\"  multilayers.   The  impact  of these studies will be the development of new concepts  that  govern the behavior of a surface and an interface.  %%%  The  physical  and  chemical properties of materials  are  varied  and  extremely  complex,  governed by the details of  the  interactions  of  billions  and  billions of electrons with billions of  ions.   On  the  other  hand,  it  is  this complexity that leads to  applicability  of  materials in our daily lives, such as integrated circuits (computers),  magnetic  recording, catalytic activity, and light weight  but  strong  materials,  so  that  new  material, with quite  different  or  better  physical  or  chemical  properties can be prepared.     This  research  program  uses the simple metals (e.g., lithium, sodium, beryllium)  as  the vehicle for developing a fundamental understanding of the physical  and  chemical  properties  of surfaces  and  interfaces.   It  is  the  characteristics of the surface or interface that dictates the behavior  in most of the applications above.  ***",
