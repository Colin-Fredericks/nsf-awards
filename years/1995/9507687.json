 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507687  Teyssier    This award supports collaboration between Christian  Teyssier, University of Minnesota, and Wen TianFang, China  University of Geosciences on Mechanisms of pluton  emplacement.  The PI's core research is focused on testing  the hypothesis that granitoid plutons are emplaced in the  upper crust in tensional bridges between crustal-scale  fractures.  This research is presently being conducted in  the Sierra Nevada batholith, a major continental arc in the  Circum-Pacific.  The aim of the proposed project is to  extend the analysis of pluton-emplacement mechanism to East  China in areas that underwent similar tectonic processes as  the Sierra Nevada.  The methods used in the Sierra Nevada  involve structural analysis in the field and in the  laboratory, and the analysis of anisotropy of magnetic  susceptibility of granitoid rocks in order to retrieve  information about magma flow during emplacement.  In East  China, it will be possible to add a new component to this  project, the gravity-anomaly analysis of plutons, in order  to define their three-dimensional shape.  This technique is  difficult to apply successfully within the Sierra Nevada  because the rugged topography induces large errors.  In  contrast, the plutons of East China are exposed in areas of  smooth topography, ensuring that this analysis will provide  a useful signal above the background noise.  Defining the  three-dimensional shape of plutons, and particularly the  root zones of plutons, is a key element in the hypothesis to  be tested.    The Chinese group, led by Professor Wan, has corresponded  with the PI regularly in the past two years on the methods  of pluton emplacement analysis.  The two study areas in  Eastern China were carefully chosen - in terms of tectonic  similarity to the Sierra Nevada, good field exposure, and  gentle topography - to insure meaningful results from the  analyses and thereby test different models of granitoid  emplacement effectively.  The Chinese group brings their  knowledge  of the regional geology and their experience in  the field.  The American group brings techniques of rock  magnetism and gravimetry applied to plutons.  All stages of  the work, from field analysis to laboratory measurements,  will be conducted jointly, and the results will be written  collaboratively.",
