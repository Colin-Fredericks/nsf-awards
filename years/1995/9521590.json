The field of engineering design to date has  failed to coalesce around a coherent design theory.  Yet  engineering design is an intense activity of engineering,  responsible for the bulk of the value added for the profession.   This workshop will bring together about 50 individuals who are  experts in engineering design and related fields to discuss the  possibility of obtaining a theory of design and to set research  funding priorities toward this goal.  The workshop will be  conducted over a period of three days, and it will result in a  written document that is intended to serve as the basis for setting  research directions and priorities in the NSF Design and  Integration Engineering program.       Engineering design is crucial to the entire technological  enterprise of the nation.  Advances in the theory of engineering  design will impact virtually every industry.  The teaching of  engineering design is also crucial to the economic health of the  nation.  If successful, this workshop could have a significant  impact on the conduct of engineering design and the engineering  education.",
