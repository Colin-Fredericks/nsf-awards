 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Duffy will continue ultracryogenic studies of the  mechanical quality factor (Q) of selected polycrystalline  technical materials.  The quality factor will be measured on  torsional resonators machined in the unique configuration  developed by him.  The configuration permits audio frequency  measurement (typically at 1 kHz) over a wide range of Qs  (103 - 108) and a wide range of temperatures (50mK - 300K).  Since only a small piece of material is involved (typically  6 cm diameter by 6 cm long), the cost of operation and the  turn-around time of the complex dilution refrigerator  cryostat needed for the very low temperature measurements  are kept low.    The work is to be carried out in support of cryogenic (4K)  and ultracryogenic (<100 mK) resonant mass gravity wave  antenna development both in the United States and abroad.  Close contact will be maintained with the gravity-wave-  detector community.  Materials to be studied include those  which offer the most promise for use as gravitational wave  detectors of high sensitivity.  This requires materials of  high Q, which also have appropriate inertial, elastic and  thermal properties.  Specific materials which are the focus  of this study include an explosively bonded aluminum alloy  5056 and a series of copper and aluminum alloys.  Grain size  and hardness will be evaluated.  Appropriate heat treatments  will be developed, which have been found to be so essential  for obtaining high ultracryogenic Qs in the materials  studied to date.  Ultralow temperature heat capacity and  thermal conductivity studies of selected materials will be  carried out.  In addition to supporting gravity wave antenna  development, the results should contribute to the  fundamental understanding of acoustic loss mechanisms.",
