 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505678  Dangl  A detailed understanding of the molecular events leading to plant disease resistance is of  both practical importance and basic interest. This proposal takes complementary genetic and cell biological approaches to dissect the structure and function of a particular resistance gene, called RPM1, from the model plant Arabidopsis. Continuing analysis will identify new genes required for the expression of RPM1-dependent disease resistance. The four target areas of research are: 1. structure-function analysis of the RPM1 protein, 2. its subcellular localization and topology; 3. the number and nature of other plant proteins with which it interacts and ; 4. genetic identification of other loci required for its function.  %%%  It has long been recognized that plants contain genes whose function is triggered by the presence of specific and corresponding genes in particular isolates of infecting pathogens. This \"gene for gene\" interaction is responsible for activation of the array of biochemical and cellular events leading to a disease resistant state. In addition, the initial recognition event can induce a longer lasting, systemic and pathogen non-specific immunity\" termed systemic acquired resistance. The recent cloning of several plant disease resistance genes, and the corresponding pathogen genes which trigger their action, presages fundamental breakthroughs in understanding the molecular and cellular responses of plant disease resistance. One such plant gene, RPM1, from the model plant, Arabidopsis, will be analyzed at the molecular and cellular level. The protein encoded in the gene will be analyzed for its structure-function, its subcellular localization and topology and the number and nature of other plant proteins with which it interacts. Other genetic loci required for its function will be sought.   ***",
