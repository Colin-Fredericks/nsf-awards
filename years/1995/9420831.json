This work will  develop models to describe the scaling of failure times and  distribution on system size and on the underlying damage  formation rate by using stochastic methods to calculate the  time evolution of the damage distribution.  Numerical  simulations of the damage evolution using newly-developed  efficient algorithms based on lattice Green functions will  be utilized to verify and guide the analytic model  development.  An important goal will be to identify well-  defined precursors to the failure, such that failure can be  anticipated.  The models developed here will also provide a  broad framework for interpreting experiments.  Relationships  between the spectrum of experimental data will be  elucidated.  %%%  This theoretical project involves investigating the  accumulation of damage in a variety of materials.  Both  modeling using equations and also computer simulations using  newly-developed algorithms help to understand damage.  How  damage accumulates is directly related to failure, i.e.,  when the material breaks.  The work involves applying models  for specific systems in materials such as ceramics,  polymers, composites, metals, bones, and earthquake faults.  This research area, spanning physics and materials, is  underrepresented in the Materials Theory Program, so it is  one of high priority.  ***",
