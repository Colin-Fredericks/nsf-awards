The facility will be constructed at the St.  Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory, University of Minnesota in an  existing indoor basin that is 14.3 m long and 7.3 m wide.  The  main elements of the basin will include, a rainmaker for  simulating various hydrologic regimes, a hinged floor to simulate  tectonic uplift and subsidence, a zone of ponded water and feed  points for water and sediment along the basin.  All elements of  the basin are to be computer controlled and monitored by a data  acquisition system.  The main subsystems of the data acquisition  system will be two computer controlled laser profilers for  precision measurements of microrelief, a particle imaging  velocimetry system for instantaneous measurement of surface flow  velocities, an optical imaging system for instantaneous  determination of channel depth and a stereoimaging system for  determination of overall topography.  This project is to be  constructed and utilized by an interdisciplinary team consisting  of a civil engineer, a sedimentologist,  an environmental  engineer, an agricultural engineer and an engineer with  considerable knowledge of electronics.  The basin is to be  operable in both subaerial and subaqueous mode allowing for  studies of both riverine processes and terrestrial landscape  evolution and studies of continental shelf, slope and rise  evolution.  An automated mesocosm of this kind allows for the  control of governing variables and monitoring on time and spatial  scales that are not easily observed in field situations.  This  facility should provide a bridge between simulation and field  research that hastens the development of new predictive tools and  it is intended that the facility be made available to a broad  spectrum of outside researchers.    ***",
