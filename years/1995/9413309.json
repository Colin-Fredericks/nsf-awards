 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project emphasizes practical as well as   theoretical aspects  surrounding the application and implementation of algorithms   for  computing  stationary probabilities of discrete Markov chains.  Special   attention is  devoted to applications in which discrete  models are used to   understand and  analyze the dynamics of large  systems comprised of a   collection of loosely  coupled subsystems  such as in the study of queuing models   and networks,  telecommunications, computer performance evaluation,   stochastic  automata  networks, and economic modeling and forecasting.      Algorithmic facets concern  the development and analysis of  parallel multilevel methods   based on  aggregation/disaggregation  techniques---both direct and   iterative--- and some  of these  techniques are applied to problems involving   stochastic automata  networks. An architectural aspect involves the identification   of  features of  vector and parallel computers that are best suited  for   implementing Markov  chain algorithms.    Theoretical components involve studying   properties of  Markov chains. These ideas are then used to   generate error  analyses aimed at understanding the convergence and stability    properties of  multilevel aggregation/disaggregation algorithms.",
