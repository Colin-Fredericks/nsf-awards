 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424467  Tedrow  The  discovery of spin-polarized electron tunneling has made  possible  detailed  probing  of the superconducting state  in  the  presence  of  applied  magnetic  fields  to an extent not previously  possible.   In  particular,  the  development of tunnel  barriers  that  act  as  spin  filters  has greatly increased the versatility of this technique.   In  this  work, the spin-polarized tunneling technique will be applied  to  the   investigation   of   the  density   of   states   of   thin-film  superconductors in three regimes of external influence.  In the  first  regime,   the  superconductor  will  be  subjected  to  injection   of  quasiparticles   through  a  spin-filter  tunnel  barrier   to   allow  observatio of possible spin-dependent nonequilibrium effects.  In  the  second, spin state mixing caused by spin-orbit scattering and magnetic  exchange  interactions  arising  in  rare-earth  impurities  will   be  studied.   Finally, the exchange proximity effect will be  used  along  with the tunneling spectroscopy to attempt to verify the existence  of  the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state.  %%%  Experiments  are  proposed  to study the  distribution  of  conduction  electron  energies  (the so-called \"density of states\")  in  thin-film  superconducting  materials by means of the experimental  technique  of  spin-polarized  electron tunneling.  In this technique,  electrons  of  one spin (magnetic moment) orientation \"tunnel\" preferentially through  an  insulating magnetic barrier into the superconductor; the resulting  current provides a map of the electron energies in the superconductor.  Further information will be gained by studying these effects under the  influence of external magnetic fields and in the presence of  magnetic  impurity atoms doped into the superconducting films.  ***",
