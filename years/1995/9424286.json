 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424286  Desmond    This collaborative project between a young theorist and two  experienced experimentalist to test a new theory of what  happens in the brain during learning..  The theory says that  learning in the mammalian cortex is guided by a balance  between two distinct mechanisms.  One is the continual  activity-independent changes in the connections between  neurons (called synapses) that tend to randomize the place  on a neuron where an incoming afferent neuron establishes  its connection.  The second is an activity-dependent process  in which the connections of afferent neurons that are active  at the same time are stabilized if they happen by chance to  be close together.  This means that groups of frequently co-  activated inputs to the brain come together to form  neighboring synapses and, therefore, have a more powerful  effect on their target neurons.   This theory will be tested  experimentally by looking anatomically at the spatial  arrangement of afferent synapses on target neurons when the  afferent neurons are artificially induced to have correlated  activity.  The theory will also be tested by simulating this  type of biological experiment on a computer.  The outcome of  these studies promises to have a significant impact on the  way we think about how the brain does the computations that  allow us to learn complicated patterns.",
