Support is  limited to those U.S. scientists who are students or hold  junior research positions in an academic, governmental, or  industrial institution.  This series of conferences was  initiated in 1958, soon achieved international standing, and  later was recognized by the International Union of Pure and  Applied Physics.  The conference is a prime vehicle for  international communication among scientists working in the  field of atomic, ionic and electronic collisions.  This  conference offers opportunities for students and young  scientists to interact with senior scientists from around  the world.",
