 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420843  Griffin  This project describes a molecular engineering approach to a  new class of materials with remarkable properties.  Negative  Poisson's ratio materials  (also known as auxetic materials)  expand laterally when stretched.  This is at variance with  usual expectation since virtually everything thins when  stretched - a rubber band for example.  Although  theoretically possible there are virtually no known examples  of auxetic materials.  It has however been recently  discovered that special geometric features are capable of  imparting this behavior and large scale macroscopic  structures can be built to accomplish this.  Also, special  fabrication techniques can sometimes produce this effect by  inducing unusual morphologies in certain polymeric  materials.  The Poisson's ratio is a fundamental elastic  constant of a material and is interconnected to the other  elastic constants which govern mechanical response.  Tailoring the Poisson's ratio offers the possibility of  precise control of mechanical performance.  It has been  recognized that ultimate control of such behavior lies in a  molecularly designed auxetic material which will permit  careful tailoring of this bahavior and which will give the  maximum auxetic response.  This proposal describes the  design, the synthetic approach and the characterization of  two polymeric classes each of which reflects at the  molecular level the geometric features known to be  mechanistically operative in producing an auxetic response  at the macroscopic level.    %%%    A variety of extraordinary applications can follow:  fasteners and rivets which will get fatter (tighter fit)  upon attempted removal and gaskets and seals which will seat  better (contraction) when under compression loading.  Composites are also envisioned in which an auxetic fiber  will reduce or eliminate fiber pull-out, one of the critical  problems in composite science.    ***",
