 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500279  Lomatch  The objectives of this grant are to study conventional and novel superconducting digital flux quantum devices employing the relatively young technology of multilayer Josephson junctions with n superconductor-insulator (SI) layers.  The work involves the extensive numerical modeling of multilayer junction and device behavior.  This program will draw from the results of previous computational and experimental studies, which took place during the period covered by an NSF Research Planning Grant.    A primary focus of the proposed research will be the numerical simulation of flux quantum circuitry in which multilayer junctions both serve as nonlinear kinetic inductors (passive devices) to increase circuit integration density, and as single trilayer junction replacements (active devices) to allow for new logic/voltage thresholds, novel device designs, device fault tolerance, and resistance to thermal noise.  The goal will be to optimize circuit designs to maximize parameter variation tolerances, and to include realistic considerations such as crosstalk and parasitic capacitance's and inductances so that one may produce lithographic masks suitable for the fabrication of test prototypes.    Conventional digital devices, such as select logic and memory circuitry, will be considered for optimum geometry and performance.  the unique operational features offered by flux quantum circuitry due to the natural integration of local memory and processing are further exploited by multilayer junction technology, so several novel devices will be analyzed, particularly in the area of neural-based computing and semiconductor interfacing.    If superconducting digital circuitry is to achieve the integration density that its low power dissipation allows, and if it is to compete with room temperature semiconducting digital circuitry in more than a few small niche applications, then work such as the proposed here must be pursued.  ***",
