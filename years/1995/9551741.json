 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the Mechanical Engineering (ME) Department  is developing an advanced Integrated Design, Manufacturing, and  Materials Laboratory for the improvement of its undergraduate  curriculum.   The improvement plan includes the introduction of  four experiments that will enhance eight required and two  elective ME courses in computer graphics, computer-aided  manufacturing, materials engineering, and concurrent-  engineering-related courses.   The ME and Art Departments  together with private industry are implementing the experiments  collaboratively.   The experiments integrate design,  manufacturing, materials, and concurrent engineering.  The four  selected experiments test:  (1) the application of rapid  prototyping and CAD to produce wax models for investment casting;  (2) the use of investment casting to form Al-base alloy  components (e.g., turbo impellers); (3) the use of tensile  testing to evaluate material properties and optimize casting  variables; and (4) the use of teamworking to satisfy user  requirements for producing robust designs.  The major new  equipment includes a rapid prototyping machine and computers,  investment casting equipment, and video-related equipment.   This  project is important because it will provide approximately 140  engineering students with practical skills in product design.    This can improve their performance, increase their retention  rate, and enhance their attitude toward the profession of  engineering.   The project is also significant because improved  laboratory facilities can enhance the University's engineering  curriculum and prepare a future generation of U.S.  engineers to  compete effectively in the global marketplace.",
