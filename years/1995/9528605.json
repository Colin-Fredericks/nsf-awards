 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528605  Luh       International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) is  composed of 46 National Member Organizations, each one  representing the technical societies concerned with automatic  control in its own country.  IFAC sponsors many conferences, but  the most important is the triennial World Congress.  The 12th  such IFAC World Congress was held July 19-23, l993 in Sydney,  Australia.  The 13th will be held in San Francisco, California,  June 30-July 5, 1996.  The conference in San Francisco is  expected to have a very high level of attendance from all over  the world.  It will be a particularly good forum for the exchange  of ideas among U.S. and non-U.S. researchers.         This proposal is for a Block Travel Grant from the National  Science Foundation to support graduate students from U.S.  universities to attend the 13th IFAC World Congress.  This will  provide an excellent opportunities for them to interact with the  world leading researchers in automatic control, learn the latest  technical trend, and be well prepared for their future career.  ***",
