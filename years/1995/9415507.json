 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415507  Uman    The objective of the proposed research is an improvement in the  presently existing knowledge of the physical processes comprising  the lightning discharge with emphasis on the least well understood  processes of lightning initiation in the cloud and lightning  attachment to ground.  The project includes both experimental and  theoretical studies of natural and artificially initiated (rocket-  triggered) lightning flashes.  The latter part of 1994 will be  primarily devoted to the analysis of the presently in-hand unique  triggered-lightning data (currents, multiple-station electric and  magnetic fields, and optical records) acquired in 1993 in Florida  and Alabama.  During 1995 and 1996 the research will be primarily  concentrated on building two relatively large data bases:  (1)  extremely close measurements of electric and magnetic fields (in  conjunction with simultaneous current and optical records obtained  by cooperating research groups) of the rocket-triggered lightning  at Camp Blanding, Florida and Fort McClellan, Alabama and (2)  electric and magnetic field records of both cloud-to-ground and in-  cloud natural lightning acquired with a state-of-the-art digitizing  system.  The year 1997 will be devoted primarily to the analysis of  the newly acquired data and associated theoretical studies  concentrating on the least understood processes that occur inside  the cloud and during the lightning attachment to ground.  The  development of a new theory of the lightning discharge to ground  taking into account the lightning attachment processes a will be  attempted.",
