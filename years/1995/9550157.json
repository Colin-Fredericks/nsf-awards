The 1996 NCBPS meeting is scheduled for  February, 11996 with Fisk University, Nashville, TN being the host  institution.  Professor Eugene Collins is the faculty member is  charge.  The 1997 NCBPS is tentatively scheduled for Brookhaven  National Laboratory as host institution in February or March 1997.    The 1995 Conference will be the ninth consecutive meeting of NCBPS.   The objective of the NCBPS meeting is to assist and encourage Black  students who have shown interest and ability in physics to enter  and complete Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research, teaching, or  technical careers commensurate with their educational achievement  in physics.    NCBPS originated with a group of Black graduate students at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The conferences have been  organized and implemented by students with faculty and staff  assistance at the various host institutions throughout the country.   The growth of conference participation is shown as follows:                   1987      MIT                           34                 1988      MIT                           68                 1989      Howard University             124                 1990      Southern University           140                 1991      Hampton University            150                 1992      Stanford University           150*                 1993      Michigan State University     210**                 1994      Georgia Institute of Technology328                     *Over 50 students were turned away due to lack of funds                 **Over 100 students were denied access due to lack of funds      Information is presented through the following mechanisms (1)  lectures by distinguished scientists and engineers, (2) technical  presentations by Black gra duate and undergraduate students, (3)  workshops on the graduate admission process, (4) seminars on  financial support to students for science education at the  university level, (5) forums on successfully completing a graduate  programs in physics, and (6) career opportunities at all degree  levels.  The primary audience for the conference consists of  undergraduate students who are majoring in physics and/or who have  expressed a sincere interest in physics.  A principal goal for the  Conference is to permit these students, who are in the process of  making career decisions, the opportunity to discuss with graduate  students and scientists their concerns regarding a scientific  career and to seek recommendations and advice about educational  paths.",
