 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal focuses on the effect of math and science skills  learned in high school on the later earnings, employment, and  education of non-college-bound youth.  While analyst have given  considerable attention to the effect of taking math and science on  getting into the pipeline to college, little attention has been  given to the effects of math and science for non-college-bound  youth.  At the same time, the employment and earnings of non-  college-bound youth have both fall substantially, causing serious  concern among policy makers.  The proposed study will be based on  the High School and Beyond Survey which covers a complete decade  after high school allows for detailed analysis of types of  importantly, the survey data cover recent years when the drop in  the earnings of non-college-educated people has been quite  severe. This work should provide valuable insights into the impact  of math and science skills learned in high school on outcomes  later in life for the large portion of youth who are non-college-  bound and are after overlooked in other work.",
