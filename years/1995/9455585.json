They will be distributed on CD-ROMs that can  be used by students at school or elsewhere on equipment that will  be available to most students upon completion of the project.  This project will make use of new technologies and findings in  physics educational research to provide a computer based learning  environment that will facilitate students actively constructing the  conceptual framework of Newtonian mechanics. Students will be  introduced to basic concepts through short video clips of actual  events. Many of these will involve confrontations with common  misconceptions. Computer animations and graphics will help  illustrate various interpretations and develop the principles  involved. Students will interact with simulations and physical  representations such as vectors, diagrams, graphs, with appropriate  feedback and help, enabling them to compare predictions made from  their conceptual models with those of the Newtonian model and the  real world.  After learning the concepts, students will be introduced to  appropriate mathematical models, which can be adapted to the  students background and ability. This will allow the programs to be  used in courses of different mathematical levels.  Most of the video clips will be taken from the extensive collection  produced at Valencia Community College in Orlando FL. Video  editing, additional production, and animation will be done at a  local high school which has a nationally recognized electronics  arts program that has received extensive support from Silicon  Valley companies. Simulations will be provided by an Interactive  Physics player, licensed from Knowledge Revolution.",
