 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505454  Bisesi  This is an award to support exploratory research on the potential  for enhancement of biological processes for degradation of  petroleum hydrocarbons present in soil that has been polluted by  these substances.  In this research, soil contaminated with the  target hydrocarbons will be innoculated with earthworm species,  selected for their enzymatic pathways known to accelerate  transformation of organic compounds, and with soil microorganisms  that contain enzymes known to catalyze the degradation of toxic  organic compounds.  The investigator plans on studying the  influence of extracellular enzymes produced by microorganisms and  soil characteristics that affect the process by which organic  soil contaminants derived from petroleum may be transformed into  substances of lesser or no pollutional significance.    The proposal leading to this award was submitted to NSF under the  Special Guidelines for an SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory  Research) in the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (NSF 94-2).  Results of  this research are expected to provide the basis for further  research on the potential for biologically augmenting and  enhancing the decontamination of soil that has been polluted by  gasoline, lubricating oil and diesel fuel that has leaked from  underground storage tanks or otherwise entered soil where the  hydrocarbons pose a potential for contaminating groundwater.  ***",
