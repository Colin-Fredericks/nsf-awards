 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the mathematics reform effort of the past decade, there has been  growing recognition that the history of mathematics should be an  integral part of the teaching and learning of mathematics at all  levels. National standards for the preparation of teachers of  mathematics in K-12 call for inclusion of history of mathematics in  pre-service programs.  Mathematicians who teach the history of  mathematics and who use this history to improve their teaching are  in need of more knowledge and resources to prepare to teach their  students.    The Mathematical Association of America (MAA), in cooperation with  The American University (TAU), is creating an Institute in the  History of Mathematics and its Use in Teaching (IHMT). The goal is  to increase the presence of history in the undergraduate  mathematics curriculum and teacher preparation in mathematics  curriculum.    Through intensive three-week programs in two successive summers, 80  mathematics faculty members are being prepared to teach courses in  the history of mathematics and to use history to improve their  teaching of standard undergraduate mathematics courses. Thirteen  historians of mathematics, all of whom are known to be excellent  teachers, lead explorations of the history of mathematics from  antiquity through the twentieth-century, stressing applications and  links between different areas of mathematics.    Specific techniques for incorporating history into undergraduate  mathematics courses are a central theme. Through presentations at  national and regional mathematics meetings, publications, and  electronic communications, the information and techniques of IHMT  are being disseminated nationally. The home institutions, the  students at those institutions for generations and the collegiate  mathematics community will benefit from this broader understanding  of mathematics and its teaching.  Through the inclusion of history  in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum, a new generation of  teachers, as a resulty of their undergr aduate experience, will be  able to enrich the courses they teach and benefit all students, at  all grade levels, with interesting and relevant courses in  mathematics.",
