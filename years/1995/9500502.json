It brings five knowledgeable South African scientists/ policy makers to brief interested members of the USG, academic, technical and NGO communities, and representatives of bilateral and multilateral and private donor agencies on the changing environment for research and development in South Africa and to explore issues and opportunities for fruitful, mutually beneficial cooperation.  In addition to their presentations, the South African visitors will also meet with representatives of key organizations in the Washington area to explore specific possibilities of cooperation in more detail.      The demise of apartheid has presented South Africa with enormous challenges of national reconstruction and development.  Science and engineering capacity is one of South Africa's strengths.  The establishment of links between the governments of South Africa and United States, and between their respective scientific and academic institutions, will help to end the isolation of South Africa and permit it to begin to develop its human resource base and utilize its scientific capabilities for the benefit of the entire population of the country as well as for the rest of southern Africa.  Any such scientific and technological cooperation will have a prominent role in the new relationship between the governments of South Africa and the United States.    ***",
