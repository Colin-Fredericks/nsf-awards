Recognizing the many advantages of Si substrates and the fact that Si-based devices will continue to dominate the market, this project explores heteroepitaxial growth by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on Si substrates for use in monolithic integrated devices which require single-crystal layers of different materials. Prior work on epitaxial CaF2 on Si will be extended to MgF2 and CdF2 which both (unlike CaF2) have smaller lattice parameters than Si. Appropriate combinations of these two fluorides with CaF2 will allow close lattice matching with Si. The growth of epitaxial GaN on Si is targeted as a particular goal of the development of substrate engineering techniques using fluoride buffer layers.  In addition, the possibility of developing opto-electronic devices directly in the epitaxial fluorides by doping the fluoride with rare earth metals and then measuring their optical properties will be explored. Electron transport through the single crystal materials will be studied for possibilities of charge-injection photonic devices. Charge transport will also be examined in very thin epitaxial fluoride layers for application in barrier devices such as Schottky barrier detectors and ballistic electron detectors. These charge transport measurements will be significantly aided by development of ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) techniques both inside and outside the MBE system. %%%  This program will be a comprehensive investigation of an important class of materials whose electronic properties may result in the integration of new functional heterojunction electronic and optoelectronic materials and devices on silicon substrates.  Because of the pervasiveness of silicon integrated circuit technology and its enormous economic importance, the technological impact of the p roposed program is potentially very large.  An important feature of the program is the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials research. ***",
