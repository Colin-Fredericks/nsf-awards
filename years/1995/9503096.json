Research in this  area ranges from the design to the  implementation of programming languages,  focusing on the  semantics of such languages, and includes those areas of  mathematics that underlie these research areas.  Topics ranged  from type theory,  polymorphism, and models of the lambda calculus  to specification, program  logics, and proof theories.  Previous  meetings have been distinguished by the  breadth of interests of  the participants and by the high degree of interaction  that has  taken place between researchers representing these diverse areas.  The purpose of this award was to assist students and to create  wider  opportunities for participation in this research community,  in particular for  women and members of other underrepresented  groups.",
