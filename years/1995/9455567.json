 "awd_abstract_narration": "The visualization of complicated three dimensional Inorganic,  Bioinorganic, and Solid State chemical structures is a particularly  difficult problem for students to overcome when the primary means  of communication is the two dimensional world of text books,  blackboards, and overhead projector screens.  Due to the increased  performance and availability of personal computers, both  instructors and students are beginning to embrace interactive  multimedia as a means of communicating chemical information.  The  goal of this project is to provide on CD-ROM a wide variety of  manipulatable molecular models, miniature movies, and dynamic  animations that address the topics in Inorganic and Bioinorganic  chemistry that will most benefit from a multimedia format.  The  free software Chem3D Viewer is being used to present a database of  hundreds of accurate crystal structures that will benefit students  and teachers at all levels who encounter inorganic structures.   Stand alone tutorials that describe the use of the software and  explain difficult structural concepts of inorganic chemistry are  being produced.  Dissemination of test versions will be via the  Internet, followed by the complete version on CD-ROM, and evaluated  by polling users at a variety of small and large institutions.",
