Since its inception in 1986,  the center has grown to become an  internationally recognized center  of excellence in optics with 26  faculty, 25 PhD-level research  scientists, and 70 graduate  students. UCF offers PhD programs  in Optical Physics, Optical Science  & Engineering and Electrical  Engineering with Specialization in  Electro-Optics. By innovative use  of NSF and matching funds, CREOL  proposes to recruit 20 new students  over five years, from a diverse  pool across the USA, into an NSF  Graduate Research Traineeship (GRT)  program that will train PhDs in the  nationally critical field of  optical science and engineering. To  achieve this end, each GRT student  will participate in a research  project, supervised by an  internationally recognized faculty  researcher in one of the six  subdisciplines described in the  proposal. These subdisciplines  represent the new growth areas of  research in the center and those in  which new faculty have recently  been hired. The GRT students will  receive a training that will  include instruction and advisement  by internationally recognized  faculty, industrial internships,  instruction and practice in  undergraduate teaching and  interaction with students and  faculty from international  locations.",
