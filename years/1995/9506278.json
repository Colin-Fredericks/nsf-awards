The main goal of  this research is to improve existing tools for the modeling of  protein structures by including extra information obtained from the  new type of analysis of regularities in known protein structures.   This whole approach can be best described as the reverse-  engineering of protein structures on the computer.  Protein  structures will be \"decomposed\" into interacting fragments, and, by  utilizing a library of \"parts\", they will be rebuilt.  To gain  experience as well as to measure progress during the method  development, known structures will be modeled onto structures of  other proteins from their structural families.  Experience gained  in the \"rebuilding\" of known structures will be used to make  structural predictions for a number of real targets.  %%%  The main scientific trust in this research is to explore and  utilize a new, interaction based, description of proteins.  In such  a description, a protein is seen as a collection of interactions  between side chains, rather than as a set of points in space; thus,  the very features responsible for the folding to a particular  structure are directly used in the structure description itself.   The quality of protein models obtained by homology modeling will be  improved by using insights obtained through this new perspective,  by focusing on side-chain interactions which remain constant with  sequence changes even as protein backbone shifts and slides.  The  goals of this research will be achieved in two stages.  In the  first stage, traditional modeling techniques will be supplemented  by additional information obtained from the analysis of protein  families.  In the second stage, a new modeling approach will be  developed, where the predicted protein structure will be built  inside-out, around interacting clusters of res idues, using  fragments of structures from other proteins.  To assist in  achieving these goals, a set of necessary tools will be developed.  A number of specific objectives, including building models of  proteins with various levels of homology to the target, will be  used to judge the progress of the research.  ***",
