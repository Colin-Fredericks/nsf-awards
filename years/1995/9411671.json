 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), the American high-  energy physics project begun in 1983 and abruptly terminated  in 1993 by Congress after $2 billion had been spent on  construction, offers everyone interested in science studies  a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of \"big science.\"  This four year project under the direction of Professor  Lillian Hoddeson is being carried out by an experience  multidisciplinary team and aims to unravel and explain the  factors responsible for the genesis as well as the demise of  the SSC.    A proton collider more than an order of magnitude more  energetic than any earlier accelerator and far more  expensive, the SSC was the most ambitious particle  accelerator project ever attempted.  This frontier machine  was intended to fulfill `the desires and aspirations of the  whole US high energy community.\"   Because of its size and  cost, the alliances necessary to support this project  reached deep into the political, industrial, and even  military communities of the United States.  Professor  Hoddeson and her team aim to examine these linkages and to  study how a major scientific community creates a large  project and reacts to its collapse.  In examining the  termination of the SSC, the study will consider whether big  science, which previously had grown almost without bounds,  has reached a turning point, or perhaps an evolutionary dead  end, and whether future projects on the scale of the SSC  will ever be possible again.    For more than a decade, all four members of this research  team have been studying the field of high-energy physics,  including the SSC, from varying perspectives-- scientific,  historical, archival, philosophical, and sociological.  Two  of them have been communicating with SSC staff in an effort  to preserve important documents as well as the collective  institutional memory.  This study will integrate the  complementary experience of these scholars of science.  They  will undertake an  intensive effort to study documenta tion,  preserve oral recollections of principal participants, and  prepare a carefully researched study of widest interest.",
