The first  consists  of  spin-polarized  quantum fluids in random  porous  media.  For  example,  pure 3He liquid and 3He-4He mixtures in  the  pores  of  bead  packs and silica aerogel will be polarized by an 8 -  10  T  magnetic files and cooled below 10 mK to study the mixture  phase  diagram,  quantum  localization  effect,  and  interference   and  localization of spin waves. The second system is fluids in porous  media at room temperature. Pulsed-field-gradient NMR will be used  to  study the geometric structure of the pore space, and to study  trace  dispersion in an applied flow over a wide range of  Peclet  numbers.  Finally,  nonlinear  waves  will  be  studied  both  in  polarized  quantum  fluids  and in a room-temperature  water-wave  experiment  to  test  the applicability of the  inverse  spectral  transform to physical systems.  %%%  The  objective  of  this  project is  to  better  understand  the  propagation  of  particles and waves in complex physical  systems  that  have  a random structure. Nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR)  will  be used to study the motions of molecules in fluids filling  the  pores  of  materials  like fine powders,  silica  gels,  and  natural  rock.  The  studies will take place  both  at  very  low  temperature,  where quantum effects will dominate,  and  at  room  temperature,   where  classical  behavior  is  found.   The   low  temperature   studies  will  test  theories   relevant   to   the  propagation of electrons in metals and semiconductors.  The  room  temperature  work  will  develop new  methods  for  studying  the  structure  of porous materials, and will test theories concerning  the  dispersion  of tracers by fluid flow. Nonlinear  waves  will  also   be   studied  in  a  sub-project  geared  toward  engaging  undergraduate students in resear ch.  ***",
