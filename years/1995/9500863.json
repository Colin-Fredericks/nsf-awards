 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500863  Kaas      This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program award  supports travel expenses, expendable research supplies and  services, related to the visits of  Drs. J. Kaas, the P.I.  and his co-P.I.s, all from Vanderbilt University,  Tennessee, to the lab of  Dr. C. E. Rocha Miranda, Univ.  Federal de Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The purpose of the  research is to develop a model of how simple, primitive  mammalian brains are organized, in terms of functionally  significant areas, nuclei and modules that are  interconnected  within cooperative systems.  This model  can be compared to those based on complex, advanced  brains, such as those of higher primates,  to determine  changes associated with complexity and enhanced  performance. The model will be based on  data obtained  from experimental studies on North and South American  opossums.  The brains of these Metatherian mammals have  changed little in external appearance, judging from the  brain endocasts of early mammals, since the major  radiation of mammals some 65 mya, and they provide the  clear advantage of availability near both the U.S.A. and  Brazilian laboratories. Previous comparative studies  provide direct evidence that the basic brain organization  of opossums is less complex and more primitive than that  of  most extant mammals, and that further studies using a  powerful range of modern techniques could provide valuable  additional insights.    The research will involve studies of the visual, auditory  and somatosensory systems that involve the majority of  neurons in neocortex, and address critical issues of motor  system organization, where Metatherian mammals may be less  complex than Eutherian mammals.  Microelectrode recordings  will be used to identify systematic representations of  sensory surfaces in the brain and microstimulation methods  will reveal movement centers.  Brain subdivisions,  identified with microelectrodes, will be further examined  for histochemical, architectonic, and molecular  distinctions, intern al microorder and patterns of  connection with other systems.    The research plan takes advantage of the extensive  previous experience of researchers in the Brazilian  laboratory in studies of the brains of opossums, and their  unique experience in characterizing the response  properties of neurons in sensory systems of opossums.  The  researchers in the U.S.A. laboratory also have relevant  experience in brain studies in opossums, as well as an  extensive background in comparative studies of brain  organization.  Investigators in the two laboratories have  both overlapping and complementary experience with  research procedures and techniques, and a joint interest  in understanding brain organization in opossums.  A merger  of efforts will  allow for greater progress in the field.      ***",
