 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521845  Jose  A variety of systems will be investigated theoretically  which impact modern condensed matter physics.  Problems to  be studied relate to glassy behavior in superconductors,  macroscopic quantum coherent phenomena, superconductor-  insulator transitions, and coherent oscillatory vortex  patterns.  These problems can be studied experimentally in a  unique OcleanO way in artificially fabricated Josephson  junction arrays.  Different types of collective vortex  ordering in these arrays will be investigated both in the  classical and, mostly, in the quantum regime.  The dynamic  response of Josephson junction arrays will be modeled by a  Langevin equation for the phases of the superconducting  order parameter and by MaxwellOs equations for the self-  induced fields.  Research will also be extended on the  response of mesoscopic systems with specially designed  geometries that have chaotic solutions in the classsical  limit.  These theoretical problems are motivated by  experiments and by the desire to expand our understanding of  previous theoretical predictions for the existence of novel  coherent vortex states.  The theoretical techniques to be  used include large scale classical and quantum Monte Carlo  simulations, renormalization group techniques, classical  dynamical systems theory, many-body techniques, path  integral methods, pseudo-spectral methods, and other  theoretical approaches deemed necessary.  Algorithms will be  developed for serial, vector and parallel platforms.  The  results of this study are likely to impact the field of  quantum effect electronics.  %%%  A theoretical and computational study will be made of  strongly interactiong microelectronic arrays.  These arrays  are excellent models for a variety of physical systems  including high temperature superconductors.  They also  exhibit chaotic behavior in certain regimes.  Besides  possessing model behavior, these arrays also serve as actual  devices which incorporate quantum effects at the  microelectronic scal e.  ***",
