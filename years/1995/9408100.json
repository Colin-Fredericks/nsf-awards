 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to research, develop, and explore applications of a new  type of optical flow sensor that can measure ultra-flow volumetric flow rates in real time with three  orders  of magnitude more sensitivity than the best commercially available  mass flow meters (which  use acoustic techniques).  The performance of this new flow  sensor is predicted to rival the best  laser doppler velocimetric results in its linear velocity sensitivity.  However, it directly measures  volumetric flow rates instead of point particle velocities.  In addition it should be a much cheaper  technology.  Such an instrument can find a wide range of applications in materials processing, medical  instrumentation, and chemical measurement and analysis, both in terms of serving present needs and in  being a new measurement tool for further research within these areas.  In this program, we will apply  the sensor to directly observe slow flows and diffusions associated with liquid chromatography  systems.  The sensor concept is based on the relativistic Fresnel drag effect which causes the speed  of lig ht to differ between upstream and downstream directed beams.  The difference in speed is  linearly proportional  to the flow velocity and can be measured with extreme sensitivity using a  state-of-the-art fiber optics Sagnac interferometer.",
