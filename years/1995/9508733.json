 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lakes constitute nearly half of inland waters by volume and provide ecologically important habitats in arid regions. They often have high rates of productivity which support higher trophic levels, especially birds. At Mono Lake, California, environmental concern has focused on the threat to increasing salinity accompanying diversions of freshwater streams out of the watershed.  State agencies have now conditioned Los Angeles water rights to raise and maintain the surface elevation of Mono Lake at a level significantly higher than the present. The ecological response to different lake levels and salinities is uncertain. During the past 16 years, Mono Lake s plankton dynamics were dominated by large changes in nutrient availability. Salinity bioassays on individual organisms and modeling studies predict higher primary and secondary productivity at the lower salinities accompanying higher surface elevations. However, recent analysis of sediment cores indicate little correlation between changes in salinity over the past 170 years and organic matter accumulation in the sediments. Thi s research will determine the response to change in salinity through key limnological measurements during the anticipated period of rising lake levels and decreasing salinity,will directly compare the resulting long-term record of plankton dynamics to the sedimentary record, and includes analysis of a 150-200 year sedimentary record for which lake level and salinity estimates are available. The comparison between the 21-yr record of plankton dynamics and organic matter accumulation in the sediments will be enhanced through contemporaneous measurements of sinking fluxes.  Saline lakes are increasingly threatened by human-caused changes in salinity. The proposed research not only addresses the impact of changing salinity at Mono Lake, but also contributes to interpreting the sedimentary record of other lakes. Additionally, this research will advance efforts at.understanding the effect of species diversity on basic functioning of ecosystems. There are no  comparable records for large, temperate, relatively deep, species poor lakes with which to compare to  well-studied, species-rich, temperate lakes. This research will help to fill that void.",
