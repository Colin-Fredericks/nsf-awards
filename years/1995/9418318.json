However, little is known at a molecular level  regarding the membrane binding of these proteins, and it has not  been possible to account for the electrostatic contributions to the  binding using simple electrostatic theories.  Neuromodulin and  MARCKS (the Myristoylated Alanine Rich C-Kinase Substrate) are  believed to play key roles as calmodulin buffers in the central  nervous system. They bind calmodulin as well as membrane surfaces,  and this binding is eliminated when they are phosphorylated by  protein kinase C.  A goal of this work is to obtain structural and  kinetic information on a remarkable set of charged peptides derived  from neuromodulin and MARCKS which exhibit all the important  properties of their parent proteins.  This information will be used  to test more sophisticated electrostatic theories, to test the role  of these proteins as calmodulin buffers, and to identify structural  paradigms for proteins that interact in a purely electrostatic  fashion with membrane surfaces. This work will make extensive use  of site-directed spin-labeling and EPR spectroscopy.  Another goal  of the work is to investigate structural deformations that occur in  calmodulin in the absence and presence of substrates.  This work  will make use of NMR and paramagnetic enhancements of nuclear  relaxation which should provide distances weighted by a sixth root  average.  The modes of binding of peptides from MARCKS and  neuromodulin which associate with calmodulin in a Ca++ dependent and  Ca++ independent fashion, respectively, will also be examined.   Proline appears with an unusually high frequency in the  transmembrane segments of membrane proteins, and a final objective  of this proposal will be to evaluate the role of proline in  controlling the flexibility or deformability o f hydrophobic  helices.  %%%   The control of cell growth and metabolism is an extremely important  process for the proper functioning of all organisms, especially  higher organisms such as plants and animals.  In a number of cases,  the pathways (or protein components) that mediate this control are  well established.  At a molecular level, however, little is known  regarding the interactions between the macromolecules mediating the  control of cell growth and metabolism.  The objective of the work  is to understand several fundamental molecular interactions that  are critical for cell control.  The understanding of this control  at a molecular level is important for several reasons.  First, it  will provide insight into how biological systems have evolved and  exploited physical properties of their molecular components.   Second it will provide information on the specific interactions  that mediate cell control.  Although it is not a primary objective  of the research, knowledge of such specific interactions will  ultimately be important in designing new drugs to treat diseases  that are associated with cell control such as viral infection and  cancer.  ***",
