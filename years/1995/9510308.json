 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of state environmental policy, with few exceptions, have concentrated on state implementation of federal mandates and have ignored state environmental policy innovations.  This research seeks to explain variations in state environmental policy innovation.     State policy innovations from 1980 to 1993 in four environmental policy areas will be examined:  hazardous waste, groundwater protection, air pollution, and solid waste recycling.  Critical theoretical propositions derived from the literature on policy innovation and diffusion will be systematically tested.   Data drawn from a fifty state survey of state administrative officials as well as from interviews with federal EPA officers will be used to test the importance of policy networks and entrepreneurs, regional determinants, and federal involvement.  A content analysis of congressional hearings on existing federal environmental laws will also inform the analysis.",
