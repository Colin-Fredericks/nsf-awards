 "awd_abstract_narration": "9402263  BROECKER    Scenarios designed to explain the 80 ppm glacial to interglacial  difference in atmospheric CO2 content recorded in ice cores can be  placed into tow categories, those involving the ocean's biologic  pump and those involving the ocean's CaCO3 cycle. The former group  received most attention; but cadmium concentration and carbon  isotope measurements on foraminifera appear to rule against them.   The latter group have, to some extent, been rejected out of hand  because the dissolution record for deep sea sediments appears to  dictate against the rather large CO32 content changes required to  accomplish the observed atmospheric CO2 change.  Recently Archer  and Maier-Reimer have found a way around the dissolution record  constraint.  They show that because of the influence of respiration  CO2 released to the upper centimeter of sediment it is possible to  have a rather large change in the steady state lysocline depth.   This study  will employ the boron isotope method to determine  whether the Archer and Maier-Reimer scenario is feasible.  Preliminary measurements on paired glacial and holocene  foraminifera (both benthic and planktonic) suggest that the ocean's  pH was, as required by the Archer and Maier-Reimer scenario, 0.2 to  0.3 units higher during glacial time.  The thrust of this research  is to make more such measurements with the highest attainable  accuracy and also to explore the validity of the numerous  assumptions on which the boron isotope pH method as applied to  marine CaCO3 is based.",
