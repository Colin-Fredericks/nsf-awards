 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program revolves around three different but related projects in discrete choice modeling  and estimation. The common theme is the modeling of consumer choice behavior, and the estimation of  models of consumer behavior on revealed preference data sets.  With the availability of electronic  scanner panel data, choice models have become very important for understanding consumer behavior.  For  example, such models may be used to evaluate the impact of the marketing mix on consumer purchasing  behavior, and to assess the patterns of competition in the market place.  The three research projects  in this study involve the use of recently developed simulation estimation techniques.  In the model of  the first project, consumer choice probabilities are high dimensional integrals over unobserved prices  and coupon values, as well as over stochastic preference shocks. Thus, Monte-Carlo methods must be  used to simulate the likelihood function in the model.  In the second and third projects, both  solution of the dynamic programming problem and construction of the likelihood function require high  dimensional integrations over stochastic process for prices,  preference shocks, etc.  In these  projects we will use MonteCarlo methods both to solve consumers' dynamic programming problems and to simulate the likelihood function.",
