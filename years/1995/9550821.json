The improvement plan proposed will introduce a  new course in VLSI system engineering technology. In this course,  students will be introduced to modern day VLSI software tools;  hierarchial representation and layout of VLSI systems;  computer-aided design of monolithic circuits at transistor gates;  circuits; register for routing and cell placement; error checking;  NMOS and CMOS processes; MOS inverter; dynamic CMOS and clocking;  special circuit layouts and technology mapping; and testability for  VLSI. The course will consist of lecture, laboratory, and team  projects on aspects of VLSI systems development including  specification, design, implementation, testing, validation,  performance evaluation, and integration into the operating  environment. Group management and team approach will be emphasized  for the projects.    As part of this proposed work, the college will undertake a major  enhancement of the computer-aided-laboratory for use in the six  academic departments within the division. The development of this  laboratory is vital to the success of the proposed emphasis in VLSI  systems courses. Students will be able to gain up-to-date  experiences needed in high technology industries.",
