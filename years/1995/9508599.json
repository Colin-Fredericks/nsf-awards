 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508599 Tu  An International Conference on Chemical Beam Epitaxy is being held to address current topics in materials growth and characterization including several contemporary topics on epitaxy of increasing importance, namely: Epitaxy, Chemical Precursors; Characterization of films and interfaces.  There are also a number of sessions dealing with physics and device aspects with a strong emphasis on fundamental processes.  Additionally there will be an opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties between universities, research institutions, and industry.  It is expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the Conference will provide an effective forum to discuss and delineate the critical scientific issues in this research area, and to consider and define the approaches and techniques needed to address them.  %%%  An evaluation of the progress and status of Chemical Beam Epitaxy and related processing, and especially critical materials research issues in epitaxy, processing, and the relationship of materials research to device and circuit fabrication along with current assessments of the most important contemporary research issues in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of advanced materials in the field of electronics and photonics.    ***",
