 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414808  Maring    The overall objectives of AEROCE Theme 2 are:       a) to characterize the physical and chemical properties of  aerosols that are important to the radiative properties of the  atmosphere and to climate;       b) to investigate the processes that affect these properties;  and        c) to assess the relative importance of natural and human  sources.       To this end an intensive aerosol measurement program that  focuses on the chemical, physical, and radiative properties of  aerosols will be carried out over the NAO and their impact on the  radiative balance in the marine atmosphere.  The component of the  program covered by this project will focus on measurements of:       1) aerosol concentrations and size distribution from 3nm to  15um;       2) aerosol light scattering, both total and backscatter at  three wavelengths using an integration nephelometer;       3)aerosol optical absorption using an aethalometer (measured  as part of a separate AEROCE Theme 2 Proposal, Savoie et al.)       Both the aerosol size and optical scattering measurements will  be made at various relative humidities to investigate the  importance of atmospheric water vapor on the physical and optical  properties of aerosols.  The program will be carried out in a  series of intensive field experiments at Barbados, Bermuda and in  the Canary Islands.  Measurements of the physical and optical  properties of aerosols will be used to develop a climatology of  these properties.  In addition, we will use our measurements of  these properties in conjunction with chemical and meteorological  data produced by other AEROCE investigators to identify and  quantify the contributions of various source regions and types.   Our data, coupled with concurrent measurements of column radiation  parameters will allow closure for the direct forcing terms in the  radiative energy balance equations.         The ultimate objective is to calculate the radiative forcing  caused by the major aerosol components over the mid- and lo w-  latitude North Atlantic and assess the relevance to climate.  These  measurements, when coupled to radiation models, will allow  estimates of the climatic consequences of future emissions  scenarios for major pollutant species.",
