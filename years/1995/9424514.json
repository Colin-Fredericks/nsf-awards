The rationale for this endeavor is to help maximize the  benefits of funding projects when they may result in  international cooperative efforts.    The project will be accomplished primarily through  interviews that will be conducted by phone and in person.  The project team may review reports resulting from  international conferences and research funded in civil  engineering to determine if commonalties exist that support  or corroborate information taken from interviews.  the  project should provide information that can help the NSF  refine its decision-making in this area of grant giving,  making international cooperative research more effective and  resulting in information that will benefit the field of  civil engineering.  ***",
