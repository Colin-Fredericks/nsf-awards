 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,  continues to advance applications in microelectrode technology. Owing to their  small size and proportionately small time constant, high speed voltammetric  responses can be generated at these electrodes for minute amounts of analyte at  nanosecond time scales. In addition, coupling the detection of electrochemically  stimulated light emission at microelectrode arrays has given rise to a novel high  flux chemiluminescent probe of surface processes. During the tenure of this thirty-  two month continuing grant, Professor Mark Wightman and his students at the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will use micro- and nanovoltammetric  electrodes to prepare ultratrace-sensitive chromatographic detectors, probe  processes associated with single molecule reactions, develop a novel source for  high resolution imaging of surfaces, and generate long-lived electrochemi-  luminescence radiation in a `solvent-less` medium.       Microvoltammetric electrodes are micron- to nanometer-sized electrodes  which can be used as detectors for trace amounts of analyte, and/or short lived  species. Professor Wightman and his students at the University of North Carolina  at Chapel Hill are advancing a new generation of these devices which can be  implanted in body tissue, inside single cells, and are capable of monitoring very  fast reaction processes. This technology will be applicable to measurements  conducted in the environmental, advanced manufacturing, and biotechnology fields.",
