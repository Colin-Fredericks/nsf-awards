The investigator  feels that to sharpen the adsorption wave-front as it moves  through the adsorbing medium will be a significant step toward  improving the efficiency of treatment devices, the effectiveness  of which is based on use of adsorption as the operative  environmental technology.  He plans on evaluating granular  activated carbon as the adsorption medium in reverse stratified  tapered adsorbers that have variable area bed configurations, the  packing arrangement of which is dependent on the direction of  liquid flow through the adsorbing and support media.    Adsorption is a unit process that has proven to be effective in  removing organic materials from aqueous suspension and solution.  Advances in fundamental understanding of the process provides the  potential basis for significant improvements in engineering  design of treatment devices and processes for improvement of the  process performance.  Results of this research are expected to  improve the engineering design of environmental technologies and  systems that utilize adsorption as the effective component of  their operation.  ***",
