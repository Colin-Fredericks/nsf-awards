 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422060  Fortune  A program will be carried out in experimental nuclear physics,  using a variety of probes from a number of user facilities.  Specific areas that will receive attention include:  pion-induced  single and double charge exchange at LAMPF, muon capture at LAMPF  and TRIUMF, (n.p) single charge exchange at TRIUMF, electron  scattering at CEBAF and as part of the HERMES project at DESY,  and nuclear structure experiments at Michigan State and  elsewhere.  The single charge exchange experiments make use of  the new neutral meson spectrometer (NMS) at LAMPF and have two  major components - search for isovector spin-flip giant dipole  resonances, and non-analog single charge exchange as pathways in  sequential double charge exchange.  The double charge exchange  program seeks 1) to elucidate the role of single and double spin  flip, both to low-lying discrete states and to giant resonances,  2) to populate giant resonances built on the isovector giant  monopole, and 3) to clarify non-sequential aspects of the  reaction mechanism.  The muon capture experiments at LAMPF and  TRIUMF determine the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant of  the semileptonic weak interaction.  The (n.p) program at TRIUMF  include extraction of strength of higher multipoles - the spin  flip dipole and quadrupole.  The HERMES proposal involves the use  of newly developed polarized gas target technology to study in a  complete and precise way to spin structure of the nucleon.  It  will measure spin-dependent deep inelastic scattering from the  proton and neutron using the longitudinally polarized electron  beam of the HERA storage ring in Germany.  At CEBAF , several  issues are addressed.  Those include measurements of the  propagation of nucleons through the nuclear medium, in particular  an effect called color transparency, they also include pion  electroproduction on nucleons in nuclei and the study of the  structure of nuclei containing strange baryons.  Work in the area  of nuclear structure will concentra te on investigation of the  behavior of systems with a neutron-to-proton ratio significantly  different from that found in stable nuclei.  Particle gamma  coincidence techniques will be used to observe electromagnetic  transitions in nuclei with nearly equal numbers of neutrons and  protons with masses between 54 and 84.  Work on elementary  excitations in very light highly neutron-rich systems such as 6He  and 8He will also be pursued.  The relative role of Coulomb and  nuclear forces in the breakup of 6He and related systems will be  studies at energies near 60 MeV/nucleon using a highly efficient  array of scintillation detectors to tag events in which breakup  is accompanied by gamma rays from the target.  ***",
