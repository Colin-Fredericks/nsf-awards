 "awd_abstract_narration": "The California State University, Chico proposes to conduct a  residential summer science camp on its campus for 50 Native  American youth from rurally isolated, northeastern California, in  the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades.  Over a three year period  this amounts to 150 students being served.  The camp will be  composed of two, two-week sessions each summer.  These sessions  will take place during the month of July.  This program will be  delivered by University faculty and staff, and American Indian  youth counselors will be role models.  The curriculum will be  conducted through the College of Natural Sciences.  Because the  world of the Native American student is relatively limited in the  science and mathematics areas, this camp will provide exercises and  experiences that students can relate to.  The activities will be  hands-on, involving students in learning practical aspects of  design, analysis, and manufacture while learning and reinforcing  the content and principles of chemistry, biology, physics, math,  and engineering which apply.  This SSC program will follow students  through a tracking program to establish completion of middle  school.  The University will also provide individual career  counseling to each of the students to determine their individual  interests and goals and determine the most appropriate path to  achieve these goals.  Finally, this SSC program would be the only  one of its kind in the Western Region, focusing entirely on Native  American youth.  ***",
