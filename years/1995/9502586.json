The research component focuses on a particular area, namely  the development of a fundamental understanding of mechanical  properties of solids at the nanometer scale, and the use of  this understanding to choose appropriate tip shapes and  applied stresses to mechanically build specific nanometer-  scale structures.  The education component will broaden the  department's curriculum in theory and modeling by the  development of graduate and undergraduate computer  applications courses, including hands-on experience through  computer laboratories.  %%%  This CAREER grant contains both research and educational  thrusts that address the application of computer modeling  techniques to problems in materials science and engineering.  The research component focuses on a particular area, namely  the development of a fundamental understanding of mechanical  properties of solids and the use of this understanding to  choose appropriate tip shapes and applied stresses to  mechanically build specific structures.  This will all take  place on the length scale of tens or hundreds of atoms.
