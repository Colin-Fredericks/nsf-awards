 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arizona Collaborative for the Excellence in the Preparation of Teachers (ACEPT) is comprised of   Arizona State University (science, engineering, and mathematics faculty), Maricopa Community College District (10 colleges in the Phoenix metropolitan area), and the Navajo Community College in the northeast corner of the state.  ACEPT is collaborating with and has its goals aligned with the Phoenix Urban Systemic Initiative project.      Specific innovations to be  implementation include:  1. a new middle school endorsement with a secondary certification which will have science and  math options,  2. reform of elementary curricula-- Introductory Physical Science and Patterns in Nature (a series of  integrated-curriculum, issues-oriented lab courses),  3. reform of middle school curricula-- biology, chemistry, geology and mathematics,  4. reform of secondary curricula-- upper level physics courses,  5. incorporation of computers and other multimedia devices into the reformed curricula,  6. increased field experiences for beginning teachers and increased supervision,  7. establishment of a resource center for in-service teachers,  8. a significant increase in the number of teachers well-prepared in science and math who are  members of underrepresented groups, and  9. establishment of gender-neutral learning environments.    Specific products to be delivered include instrutional CD-ROMs and multi-media software packages, internet-accessible software, curricular materials (lesson plans, teaching guides, books), evaluation materials (science concepts inventory) and a new middle school program.    ACEPT intends to seek state approval for a post-baccalaureate Middle School Endorsement within the existing secondary certification.  Should this effort fail, ACEPT will still have achieved teachers with secondary certification, who are amply qualified to teach at the middle school levels.  Course reforms (principally at the introductory level) are planned for mathematics, physics, geology, and biology.     The particular experiences planned for the novice teachers include: being paired with supervising teachers who support appropriate pedagogical methods for teaching science and mathematics, receiving rich and stimulating field experiences which will allow them to utilize the teaching methods learned from the ACEPT curriculum within their own classrooms.    ACEPT is committing to provide 10 graduate fellowships (at $5600 each) each year to attract out-of-state minority students into the middle school endorsement program.  Within the state of Arizona, ACEPT will seek to recruit minorities and women from affiliated pre-college programs (PRIME, CRCM, and USI), current science, engineering and mathematics students, and existing minority female teachers' aides.  Increasing the number of education majors who are members of groups underrepresented in science, mathematics, and engineering from 250 to 500.    ACEPT plans to establish, at ASU, a Center for Learning Science and Mathematics to serve as a teacher resource in the Phoenix area.  ACEPT also plans to make extensive use of information technology-- linking all ACEPT institutions by internet and emphasizing the development of multimedia presentations which can be distributed via CD-ROM and the internet.    Outcomes to be achieved within the grant period include:  1. Increase from 250 minority education majors to 500  2. 8200 K-12 teachers educated (165 certified in math and science  see letter dated February 16,  1995 ).  3. 50 university and community college faculty enhanced  4. 75 K-12 teachers will receive in-service education (down from 100 in proposal, see letter dated  February 16, 1995).    Evaluation of ACEPT activities to measure achievement of desired pedagogic outcomes includes use of the widely respected Force Concept Inventory developed by Hestenes and co-workers as well as the newly developed Science Concept Inventories.  Additionally, two generic inventories will be used to assess students attitudes toward science and student beliefs  about the processes of science.  Assessments using the inventories will occur in both ACEPT and non-ACEPT programs.    ACEPT's project activities are being closely coordinated with other large grants made by NSF and other agencies within Arizona",
