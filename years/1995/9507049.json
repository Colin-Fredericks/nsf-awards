 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507049  Servetnick    Mesoderm induction in Xenopus laevis embryos is mediated by a  number of diffusible signals, including members of the fibroblast  growth factor (FGF) family of signalling molecules. Members of the  FGF family show mesoderm inducing activity in vitro, FGF's are  expressed at the appropriate time and place in embryonic  development, and inactivation of FGF receptors leads to defects in  mesoderm formation in vivo. The FGF signalling pathway interacts  with other signalling pathways that are thought to operate in  mesoderm induction (including members of the TGF-beta superfamily),  though the nature of these interactions is poorly understood. The  proposed project focuses on a cDNA clone encoding a novel FGF  receptor, termed F37, from early Xenopus embryos. Preliminary data  show that F37 mRNA is present in the unfertilized egg, and remains  present through early development, consistent with a role for its  cognate FGF receptor in mesoderm induction. Because experiments to  date have characterized only a single FGF receptor present in the  Xenopus embryo during the period of mesoderm induction, the  presence of this second FGF receptor mRNA suggests that binding of  FGF's to different FGF receptors, or the interactions between  different FGF receptors, may play a role in the induction or  patterning of mesoderm. A full length F37 clone will be isolated,  sequenced, and its embryonic expression pattern will be  characterized both temporally and spatially, using RNA blots and  whole mount is situ hybridization. To determine whether the  regulation of F37 expression is similar to, or different from,  previously characterized Xenopus FGF receptors, the expression of  all the Xenopus FGF receptor mRNAs will be analyzed in several  ways. Using RNA blots, 1) the expression pattern of the FGF  receptor mRNAs in isolated animal caps will be determined; and 2)  the timing of polyadenylation (and presumably translation) of the  various FGF receptor mRNAs during development will be  determined.  Finally, experiments will be performed to test the hypothesis that  over expression of FGF receptors can extend the period of  competence to respond to mesoderm induction.  ***",
