The purpose of CONCUR '95 was to  bring together researchers,  developers, and students from  academia, industry, and government so that the  science of  concurrency theories and the technology of their applications can  be advanced.  The conference spans all areas of semantics,  models, logics, and  verification techniques for concurrent  systems.  Particular topics include, but  are not limited to,  process algebras, Petri nets, true concurrency,  shared-memory and  message-passing formalisms, operational and denotational  semantics, programming language semantics, concurrent logic and  constraint  programming, fairness, temporal logics, compositional  analysis techniques,  model checking, verification tools, and  applications.    The primary goal of  holding CONCUR '95 in the U.S. was to  increase participation by American  researchers in the area, and  to encourage interaction among the various  schools, both European  and American, that have worked towards formal approaches  to  concurrency.",
