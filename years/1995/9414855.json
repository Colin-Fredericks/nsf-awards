 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Breslow of Columbia University  will develop methods that cause organic reactions to occur in water solutions.  Organic  molecules will be incorporated into cyclodextrin cavities and these complexes will be dissolved  in aqueous solutions.  This technique will allow the study of the effects of water on normally  hydrophobic reactions of organic compounds.  Cyclodextrins will be modified to contain by  covalent bonds biphasic organic catalysts whose ability to accelerate certain organic reactions  in the presence of metal ions will be studied.  The use of selected cyclodextrins will also allow  the determination of specific geometry requirements that are anticipated to occur in selected  organic reactions.   The goals described in the proposal are applicable to the area of  environmentally chemically benign synthesis.    This research will use the unique shapes of naturally occurring cyclodextrins, found in plants  rich in starch, as miniature containers in which certain organic reactions will occur while the  entire mixture is dissolved in water.  Many organic substances resist interacting with water and  exhibit hydrophobic behavior.  The use of cyclodextrins as containers which dissolve in water  will allow a unique study of the hydrophobic reactivity of organic compounds in a water  environment.  This research represents an important development of environmentally benign  chemical synthesis studies that can help to reduce pollution from manufacturing processes in the  chemical industry.",
