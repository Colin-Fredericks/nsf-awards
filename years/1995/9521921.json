On 9  June 1994, the largest deep earthquake ever seismologically  recorded occurred 650 km beneath Northern Bolivia.  Its  extraordinary size is illustrated by the fact that ground motion  was felt as far away as Seattle and Toronto, 9000 km from the  epicenter.  This earthquake has become the focus of intensive  seismological study, because the physical process permitting  seismic failure at these extreme depths is a long-standing  unresolved question.  Although geodetic studies have never been  previously used to study a deep earthquake, they are practical in  this case.  The earthquake is so large that centimeter-level static  displacements above the hypocenter appear likely, based on both  seismological observations and theoretical calculations.        Through good luck, the Principal Investigators established a  geodetic network in Bolivia and measured it using the Global  Positioning System only a month before the earthquake.  Hence a  resurvey of the network would yield the first direct observation of  static displacements following a deep earthquake.  The comparison  of geodetic and seismological results would be especially valuable  because the physical process causing deep earthquakes is still  unknown, but is most likely very different from that for shallow  earthquakes.  In particular, because the leading but controversial  model for the mechanism of deep earthquakes is that they result  from solid state phase changes, there may be significant  differences between coseismic and long term deformation.        Time is of the essence, because the geodetic network was  established to measure the expected steady-state deformations  associated with shortening across the Andes.  As a result, the more  time that passes, the poorer the chances of separating the effects  of the earthquake from the tectonic shortening.  Moreover,  the cost  to measure the earthquake effects can be reduced significantly by  cooperation with a German group who plan measurements in Bolivia in  May, 1995.  Although the German study, which was planned before the  earthquake, would by itself be inadequate to resolve the earthquake  displacement, a modest investment in additional measurements would  permit joint achievement of the goal.  This research is funded  under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research program and is a  component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***",
