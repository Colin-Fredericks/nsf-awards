 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to enhance the laboratory learning  experience in courses populated by chemistry, biology, and pre-  professional majors.   Using the requested Fourier Transform  Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) in several laboratories (organic,  instrumental, physical, biochemistry, and research), students  discover molecular and quantitative information about diverse  chemical substances.   Several innovative experiments to enhance  student learning result in the discovery of the relationship  between hydrogen bonding and physical state and hydrogen bond  strength and electronegativity; measurement of bond distances  from rotational energies and bond dissociation energies from  overtone spectra; qualitative and quantitative analysis of  environmental samples; and examination of changes in protein and  nucleic acid secondary structure.   The FTIR also facilitates an  ongoing research project to determine pesticide persistence in  environmental matrices.   Through use of the FTIR in successive  laboratories, students headed for graduate study or the  environmental workforce are well prepared for the research and  testing applications of academic, industrial, private, and  governmental laboratories.",
