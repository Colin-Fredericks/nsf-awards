 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop, demonstrate, assess, and refine a new approach to manufacturing education and training which promises to enhance the effectiveness of the manufacturing workforce across a broad range of technical expertise.  The heart of the effort is a computer-based dynamic simulation and visualization of the time-dependent behavior of chemical processes and associated equipment used to execute these processes in microelectronics manufacturing.  The simulations will begin with design, optimization, and control in the area of semiconductor manufacturing, and will then validate the elements that represent the physical and chemical behavior of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and processes.  The program includes simulator development and integration, manufacturing training modules, engineering design modules, and assessment and dissemination.  The long term goals are to provide a range of simulations that can be used for training industrial technicians, graduate engineers, and graduate students in the operation of the equipment being used in electronics ma nufacturing, and to allow research and development of new and/or improved manufacturing equipment.",
