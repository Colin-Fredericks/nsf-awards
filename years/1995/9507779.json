 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506308  Emmons    The aim of this project is to elucidate the molecular genetic basis  for the evolution of a morphological novelty. The organisms to be  studied are free living soil nematodes related to the model genetic  organism Caenorhabditis elegans. In previous work it has been shown  that a novel morphological feature of the male copulatory structure  has appeared during evolution of the genus Caenorhabditis. Genetic  studies in C. elegans have revealed that development of this  feature involves several genes acting in a morphogenetic pathway.  One gene of this pathway is the nematode homolog of the  transcription factor Pax-6. Pax-6 is found in many multicellular  organisms, from insects to vertebrates, and is thought to play an  essential role in patterning the central nervous system, as well as  in the development of the eye. The role of evolutionary change at  the Pax-6 locus in the appearance of the novel morphological  feature of nematodes will be investigated. Cell lineages will be  determined for several species and compared to those of C. elegans  to determine what role change in cell lineage has played in  evolution of morphology. The Pax-6 homolog of one non-  Caenorhabditis species will be isolated, sequenced, and compared to  the gene of C. elegans. The aim is to determine whether genetic  changes affecting morphology have occurred upstream of Pax-6, in  the promoter of Pax-6, in the protein coding region of Pax-6, or  downstream of Pax-6. If the genes of C. elegans and the second  species are identical in amino acid sequence and are expressed in  the same cells, then evolutionary change must have affected  downstream functions. If the two genes are not identical, then a  series of hybrid genes constructed from the genes of the two  species will be tested in C. elegans and in the second species. By  identifying in detail the genetic changes in a developmental gene  that have given rise to changes in morphology, Dr. Emmons hopes to  help elucidate both the genetic determi nants of morphogenesis, and  the nature of the genetic changes that result in evolution of  morphology. The results of this study should contribute towards  answering several outstanding questions concerning the mechanism of  evolution.  ***",
