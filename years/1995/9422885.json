 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422885  Mathias  This project encompasses fundamental investigations of  monomer synthesis and polymerizations based on  multifunctional acrylates.  Recent results demonstrate the  ability to control rates of polymerization for monoacrylates  with a variety of pendant functional groups at the alpha  methyl position including halides, ethers and especially  esters.  The latter display unexpectedly rapid  polymerizations which make them excellent candidates for  hard and rapidly generated thin films via  photopolymerizations.  Diacrylates linked at the alpha  methyl position with ether, carbon and amine or amide groups  provide entry to high glass-transition-temperature materials  with multiple functionality pendant from the polymer  backbone.  The steric and electronic effects of these  substituents on the efficiency and stereochemistry of the  cyclopolymerization process leading to 5-and/or 6-membered  rings in the polymer backbone will be explored.  The  combination of pendant groups that can be incoprorated makes  possible applications in microlithography, biological and  drug uses, catalytic and supernculeophilic reagent  materials, and modifiers for commercially important  acrylates and methacrylates.  %%%  This project encompasses new monomers and polymers which  lead to materials with greatly improved physical and  chemical properties.  These materials have enhanced  capabilities for use in photolithography and  microelectronics, anti-cancer and biological materials,  surface coatings and encapsulation, and property enhancers  for currently used acrylate, methacrylate, and stryrenic  materials.  ***",
