 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512844  Lee  This is a three-year continuing award supporting a  collaboration between engineering research centers in the  United States and Japan.  The U.S. principal investigator is  Professor George C. Lee, Director of the National Center for  Earthquake Engineering Research (NCEER), State University of  New York, Buffalo. This award is jointly funded by the Japan  Program of the Division of International Programs and the  Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Program, Division of Civil and  Mechanical Structures, Directorate for Engineering.    During the course of this cooperative project, the  investigators in NCEER will work with researchers in the  International Center for Disaster Mitigation Engineering  (INCEDE), University of Tokyo, led by its Director,  Professor Tsuneo Katayama.  They will attempt to identify  exemplary strateeies for post-earthquake reconstruction and  recovery that have potential cross-societal applicability  through coordinated and cooperative case studies in the  United States and Japan.    The devastating events in Northridge, California in 1994 and  in Kobe, Japan in 1995 have shown that dense population  centers are very vulnerable to major earthquakes.  These  events further show that earthquake mitigation research  efforts to improve design and construction methods and  emergency response policies and procedures can substantially  reduce the loss of life and damage to buildings and  lifelines.  By convening a multidisciplinary team of  engineers and social scientists to address these issues,  this U.S.-Japan project will build upon the \"systems  integrated\" approach in earthquake hazard mitigation  research implementation that has been the underlying theme  of the NCEER since 1986.    For the most part, this grant supports research visits in  Japan by U.S. senior investigators, postdoctoral  researcheps, and graduate students.  Scientists from several  universities and research institutes are involved in the  work of both centers, NCEER and INCEDE, thus giving a   national character to the cooperative work.  ***",
