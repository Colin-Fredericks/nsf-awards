This effort will be headed by  Dr. David Olson along with co-investigators, Dr. William Crowther  and Dr. Maurice Simon.  The rationale for creating this Center is  based on the premise that: 1) Such parliaments can serve as  valuable cases for studying cross-national processes of  democratization and 2) the essential documentary records of these  institutions are resources that otherwise may not be preserved,  even by the parliaments that publish them.    The Greensboro Center's total collection will be made available  for future use by researchers and scholars interested in the  post-Communist era of legislative institution building in Central  and Eastern Europe.  The materials to be collected at the Center  feature membership directories, sessional statistical reports,  roll call reports, election statistical reports, and related  private publications and newspaper articles.  By drawing upon  well established contacts in each country, the Center will  continue its collection and archiving of new working documents as  they are issued.  Overall, the Center's collection is expected to  serve as a key national resource for research on newly  democratized parliaments, their institutionalization, and other  relevant aspects of the transition processes they affect.    Creation of this repository for archival data at the University  of North Carolina, Greensboro, complements the program objective  of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in  the United States and Eastern Europe to combine talents and pool  research resources in area of strong mutual interest a nd  competence.   ***",
