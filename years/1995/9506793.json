 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Mark D. Distefano, Chemistry Department, University of Minnesota -   Twin Cities, is supported by the Inorganic,  Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division under a   Faculty Early Career Advancement Award to design semi-synthetic  enzymes   which will catalyze regioselective transformations of organic molecules,   to undertake course and curriculum development at the graduate and   undergraduate level, and to engage  in community outreach programs. By   attaching a transition metal catalyst to a fatty acid binding protein and   by introducing a thiazolium heterocycle into the interior of the same   type of protein, catalysts for the regio- and stereo-selective oxidation   of polyolefinic species and for enantioselective carbon-carbon   bond   forming reactions will be prepared. To obtain catalysts using proteins   without covalent modification, cofactor binding domains will be   introduced into the protein by mutagenesis or by fusion enzymes. Using   current educational theory a large organic chemistry course and a   graduate course in reaction mechanisms will be redesigned to increase the   effectiveness and  intellectual stimulation of these experiences. To   communicate the excitement of science out-reach programs to local schools   will be expanded.  Many synthetic chemicals are made using processes that involve toxic   materials and the disposal of the resulting waste products has created   enormous environmental problems. One solution to these difficulties   employs enzymes (protein based catalysts) to catalyze chemical reactions.   The goal of this project is to prepare new enzymes which will accomplish   important chemical transformations. Success in this project would lead to   the ability to prepare semi-synthetic enzymes which are capable of   performing very efficient transformations for which no natural enzymes   are know. The educational activities are designed toward increasing   student appreciation of chemistry and will involve school children to   graduate students.",
