S.  cities for the period 1945-1994.  The study provides a  comparative longitudinal analysis of the impact of black  political participation on the governmental allocation of  benefits to blacks in these 14 cities and examines the value of  pluralist theory for explaining the observe impact.   Methodologically, the study employs pooled time series analysis  to examine the relationship between black political participation  and the governmental allocation of benefits to blacks over the  50-year time frame of the study.  Multiple regression will be  used to determine how much of the variance in the governmental  allocation of benefits to blacks is explained by black political  participation, at specific time points (one year time points), as  compared to other independent variables which may also affect the  governmental allocation of benefits to blacks.    This project should substantially enhance our understanding about  black politics and urban politics.  ***",
