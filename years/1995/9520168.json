 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Barkey - SGER    There are a number of technological applications of intrinsically conductive polymers.  The unique advantages of electrochemical fabrication of intrinsically conductive polymers include the ability to reproduce surface structure with high fidelity.    Electrochemically fabricated conductive-polymer microfilaments will be evaluated for potential application as sensors.  The principle of the application is the dependence of polymer conductivity on oxidation state and the doping effect of absorbed compounds.  The evaluation will focus on the differential response of polymer conductivity to complete and incomplete combustion gases, where the latter act as reducing agents which should lower the conductivity of the filaments.  Filaments of poly (3-methyl thiophene) of diameters less than 100 nanometers have been fabricated by the PI by electrooxidative polymerization across a highly ordered poly(tetra fluoroethylene) thin-layer.  The polymer grows in the form of filaments which follow the microstructure of the PTFE layer, producing a regular array or grating.  The small size of the filaments allows very rapid diffusive response of the material.  This exploratory project will determine if the principle of operation can be applied to detection of incomplete combustion products in flue gases, and lay a foundation for further development and application of this new structure.",
