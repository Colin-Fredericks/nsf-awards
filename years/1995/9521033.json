 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research Program.  This study compares the factors that determine whether Japanese women will stay in or leave the labor force after marriage, with particular attention to the role of education.  It tests the applicability of human capital theory in the Japanese context and provides new comparisons with the United States.  The study will be based on a newly-collected survey of 2,000 women in central Japan, with respondents selected to reflect different educational experiences.  %%%   This study will contribute to the sociological understanding of the relation between women's human capital and the continuity of social stratification.  It will also add to our understanding of Japanese society generally and the ways it compares with the United States.  Policy makers should find useful information about the conflicts between work and family.   In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
