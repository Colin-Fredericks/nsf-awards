 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501841  Babuska    The project concentrates on basic problems of computational  mathematics   and its  applications in mechanics.  The following major  directions will be   addressed: 1)   The problem of a-posteriori error estimation and  adaptive   procedures; 2)   Various types of recovery of data of interest  from the finite   element solution; 3)   The problem of analysis of the  uncertainties in the   input data on the solution, of stochastic or maximal character;  and 4)     Computational aspects of the h-p version of the finite element  method.   Theoretical, computational, and implementational aspects  mentioned above   will be addressed.    Computational analysis has become the major tool in science and   engineering, because of the availability of powerful computers.   The major   problems are the assessment of the reliability of the computed  data and the   design of adaptive approaches when the computer selects by itself  the most   effective way to compute reliability data of interest.  This  project   concentrates on these essential problems.  It will address the  reliability of   the numerical solution of partial differential equations and of  the models   described by the equations, as well as adaptive approaches  leading to the   best results.",
