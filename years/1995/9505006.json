 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505006  Wilkerson       Ever since work of Serre in the 1950's, algebraic topology has  often been studied one prime at a time.  This idea, borrowed from  algebra and number theory, has resulted in new questions being  raised.  For example, what does it mean for a topological space to  be a Lie group at a particular prime p?  One can answer with a  reformulation that combines the group structure on G and the  topological structure on G into a single classifying space, BG.   Further abstraction of the properties true for all BG leads to the  definition of a p-compact group which is a suitable homotopical  analogue of a Lie group at the prime p.  Remarkably, these  p-compact groups possess analogues of standard Lie theoretical  constructions such as maximal tori, Weyl groups, and root systems.   The goal is to use these structures to produce a classification  that is similar in spirit to the classification of compact  connected Lie groups, but different in detail.  A by-product would  be the complete solution to the Steenrod question (1961) of which  spaces have mod-p cohomology algebras that are finitely generated  polynomial rings.       Algebraic topology studies geometric objects by abstracting  more tractable algebraic information.  One rich source of such data  is the group of symmetries of a geometric configuration.  These so-  called Lie groups, after the 19th century analyst and geometer,  Sophus Lie, have had profound applications in algebra, physics, and  number theory.  One advantage of algebraic topology and homotopy  theory is that its natural tools, such as homology and homotopy  groups, are impervious to small deformations or changes in the  geometric structure under study.  The goal of this work is to  create a classification of the homotopical analogues of Lie groups  by the study of the algebraic topology of their classifying spaces.  ***",
