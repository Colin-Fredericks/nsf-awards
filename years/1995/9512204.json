 "awd_abstract_narration": "The following proposal is a multi-departmental effort requesting funds for the acquisition of a new scanning electron microscope (SEM) with X-ray microanalyzer (EDX) and cold stage to replace the outdated SEM at Northern Arizona University (NAU).  The new SEM will incorporate numerous technical features necessary for research and teaching not now available at Northern Arizona University.  The Electron Microscope Facility services the NAU campus and Northern  Arizona community.  Since the current SEM (an Amray 1000) was acquired in 1974, it has been continuously used in teaching and in a variety of primary research investigations and has been operated under regular maintenance contracts.  Recently, maintenance calls have become more frequent, down time has increased, and replacement parts are becoming more difficult to obtain.  The number of research faculty (40), graduate and undergraduate students (25), and courses (10), making regular use of the facility in the past few years has sharply risen.  The AMRAY 1000 is no longer capable of providing the services required of a rapidly growing university community now exceeding 18,000 students and 550 faculty.  This proposal incorporates the present and future needs for a modern SEM facility wit integrated X-ray capabilities and cryostage unit.  The principle investigators listed are 9 faculty members representing 6  university departments.  This proposal is being submitted to the ARI Program for the following reasons:  1) The EM facility is used by the entire NAU community and thus exists as an interdisiplinary center.  2) a number of the co-PI's, and the PI himself, are not presently funded by the NSF and as stated in the ARI Program brochure (page 1), to qualify for ARI funding, \"research  activities...need not be supported by NSF or the Federal Government\".  3) acquisition of the instrument requested herein is the first major step in a modernization effort planned for the NAU EM facility.  The long term plan is for an integrated imaging facility in which digital images from light, fluorescence, confocal, scanning and transmission microscopes will be stored (TIFF format) in an EM Image library and made available to NAU researchers, teachers and students, located both on campus and at the 9 NAU remote sites via the Internet (see Section I, EM facility Vision Plan).",
