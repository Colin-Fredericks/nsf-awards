The use of more  interesting materials would promote student involvement, while  presentation in an intellectually stimulating context would enhance  learning. This project is developing a series of experiments on  plant acids and pigments designed to implement a new approach to  engaging students in science. The target audience of these  exercises is non-major biochemistry students. The experiments are  designed to focus on the development of student expertise in the  use of research tools, expose all students to the process of  scientific research, and provide a framework for cooperative  learning opportunities. The project is developing coordinated  experiments which will reward students with a sense of progressive  mastery of earlier concepts and tools, and foster a holistic view  of science. The goal of this tool-based approach is to empower  students to generate and answer their own questions about the world  around them and lead them into independent investigations. Plant  acids are used to provide a pedagogical vehicle for learning about  Ph and biological buffering, while providing a relevant bridge to  familiar commercial products. Plant pigments, specifically  anthocyanins, chlorophylls and carotenoids, are used to provide an  interesting and colorful approach to an understanding of  biochemical phenomena. The developed exercises will be field tested  at the P.I.'s institution and disseminated without cost to  inte rested undergraduate and educators via electronic means over  the Internet.  The methods and exercises developed as part of this  project will be utilized in the development of an advanced science  content course for pre-service teachers in collaboration with  faculty from the University of Nebraska Teachers College.",
