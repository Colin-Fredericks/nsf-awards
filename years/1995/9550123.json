 "awd_abstract_narration": "9550123  Fridley    The State of Utah is in the process of reviewing its secondary core  science curriculum.  They have determined that about one-third of  the major objectives within the 9th grade curriculum are related to  global changes in the oceans or atmosphere.  Thus, as they say a  \"planning grant will provide Utah with an opportunity to assure  that global change education remains prominent within the statewide  ninth grade science curriculum; that teachers have exemplary lesson  plans with local and statewide resources to help teach global  change; that formal and informal community resources focused on  global change are coordinated with the work of teachers and  administrators in global change education; and that plans can be  made to secure future sources of revenue to continue global change  education training and coordination.\"  A steering committee made up  of teachers and science coordinators will develop a five year plan  and establish a resource database.  The impact of the program will  be statewide, especially at the ninth grade level.  Planning  activities include a variety of meetings that will move the plan  forward from concept to curriculum plans, by increasing the  networks of interested teachers and administrators, developing a  database including lesson plans produced by others about global  change education.  These will be evaluated for potential use in  Utah.    No-cost sharing information is provided.",
