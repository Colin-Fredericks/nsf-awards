 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathias       The investigator studies the accuracy of parallel algorithms  for finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear systems and  develops efficient parallel algorithms for eigenvalue problems,  especially the nonsymmetric case.  The first part of the project  focuses on analysing the accuracy of parallel algorithms -- in  particular  1. parallel prefix type algorithms  2. Jacobi algorithms for the (possibly generalized) symmetric     eigenvalue and singular value problems  3. implementations of the Hessenberg QR algorithm.  The question of accuracy is important, though little work has been  done on it, because some parallel algorithms can be much less  accurate than the corresponding serial algorithm -- so much so  that the results that they produce are meaningless.  The second  part of the project seeks efficient parallel algorithms for the  nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem and to improve the efficiency of  the parallel algorithms for the symmetric eigenvalue problem.  The  nonsymmetric case is especially important as there is no algorithm  for this problem that can properly exploit the capabilities of a  parallel computer.       Parallel algorithms are widely used and studied because they  allow one to solve a computational problem in much less time than  if one were to use a serial algorithm.  As parallel computing  becomes increasing common it is important to have parallel  algorithms that are both accurate and efficient.  The goal of this  project is to provide such algorithms for problems in numerical  linear algebra.  Eigenproblems arise naturally in every area of  science and technology, so effective algorithms to solve them have  broad impact.",
