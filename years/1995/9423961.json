The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Julia L. Lawall to work with Professor Charles  Consel of the University of Rennes/Irisa in France on the  development of an incremental specialization system.    The French side of this collaboration is already  collaborating with a group in the U.S. on using incremental  specialization in the development of portable micro-kernel  operating system.  Micro-kernel is a system built out of  modules on top of a very small kernel.  Incremental  specialization would allow an operating system built in this  manner to perform efficiently, by specializing the  interactions between the modules to the demands placed on  the operating system.  The U.S. group is focusing on the  operating systems aspects of the project, while the French  group (which will now include Dr. Lawall) is focusing on the  development of the incremental specialization systems.   ***",
