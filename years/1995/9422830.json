 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422830  Taylor    Few concepts in economics are as intuitive as the idea that  traders on the long side of a market receive little of the gains  from trade.  In the classic one-shot trading game in which  identical buyers each with unit demands for an indivisible  homogenous good face identical sellers each with one unit of the  good for sale, if buyers outnumber sellers then any outcome that  confers gains from trade to a buyer will be undercut by higher  bids from the buyers who would otherwise be frozen out.    By the same logic if sellers outnumber buyers, then sellers will  keep making lower offers until all gains from trade for the  sellers have been eliminated.  But this classic result is brittle  because the equilibrium abruptly changes when moving from more  sellers than buyers to more buyers than sellers and market  institutions affect the distribution of the gains from trade only  in the very special case in which the number of buyers and  sellers is equal.  The contribution of this research will be to  extend the classic one-shot trading game to an infinite horizon  environment with stochastic arrival of new traders.  This  generalization not only lends realism to the setting but it  softens the brittle \"all-or-nothing\" equilibrium outcome in an  intuitive and appealing way.  Preliminary findings indicate that  the equilibrium terms of trade depend both on spot market  conditions and market demographics.  When agents discount  heavily, the degree of imbalance in the spot-market plays the  central role in determining the equilibrium terms of trade, and  when agents are patient, market demographics are paramount.   Several pricing institutions are considered, and the incremental  value to the side of the market which posts prices is identified.   Under a simple dynamic adjustment process, the expected duration  of a market \"correction\" can be calculated.",
