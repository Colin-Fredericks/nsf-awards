Proteins are synthesized on the ribosome according to the information encoded in messenger RNA (mRNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) acts as an adaptor molecule that supplies activated amino acids and decodes mRNA. Formation of the peptide bond is followed by translocation, a process that shifts mRNA by one codon, displaces peptidyl tRNA from the A site to the P site and transfers deacylated tRNA from the P site to the E site. An ordered series of interactions between ribosomes, tRNA, mRNA and translational factors is required during this process. Our knowledge about the ways translational apparatus work is still limited, because the nature of the interacti ons in the translocation process is not well understood. The molecular mechanism of translocation of tRNA mRNA complexes through the ribosome is evolutionarily conserved. In Escherichia coli, this process is mediated by elongation factor G (EF G) while in eukaryotes, translocation is catalyzed by elongation factor 2 (EF 2). Recently EF 2 has been linked to cancer and aging process based on levels of EF 2 in normal and cancerous cells. Both EF G and EF 2 are thought to act as molecular switches regulated by their ribosome dependent GTP hydrolysis activities. Evidence gathered during the last two decades strongly suggest that EF G interactions with 23S rRNA and tRNA play an important role in translocation. While EF G 23S rRNA interactions have been extensively studied, nearly nothing is known about potential EF G tRNA interactions.  The main questions which will be addressed in this proposal are: (1) How are EF G and tRNA arranged on the ribosome at different stages of translocation ? (2) Which structural determinants within tRNA are recognized by EF-G ? To begin answering these questions, thereby broadening our understanding of translocation, the following experiments will be performed: (1) Transfer RNA derivatives containing photoreactive nucleotides will be constructed using recently developed recombinant RNA techniques. Photoreactive tRNA species will be cross linked to EF G at various stages of translocation. As photolysis of photoreactive nucleotides generates 'zero length' cross links, photoaffinity labeling experiments will be used to identify the components of EF G and tRNA that are in contact. (2) Cross linking experiments will be followed by chemical footprinting of variants of native and unmodified tRNAs to determine which structural features of tRNA are required for its recognition by EF G. Data derived from the cross linking and chemical footprinting studies will be used to initiate in vitro mutagenesis of EF G. This line of investigation will build a foundation for future studies on  amino acids in EF G which contribute to EF G tRNA interaction.  Data derived from cross linking studies, when incorporated into the recently solved three dimensional structure of EF G, will provide the first information on the mutual arrangement of EF G and tRNA on the Escherichia coli ribosome during the elongation cycle of protein synthesis. Identification of nucleotides and, in the future, amino acids involved in EF G tRNA interactions will also further our insight into the mechanism of translocation during protein synthesis in Escherichia coli. Given the considerable conservation of the translational apparatus throughout evolution, this information should lay the groundwork for better understanding of ribosomal translocation in other organisms. %%% The molecular mechanism of translocation of transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) through the ribosome is evolutionarily conserved.
