 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and   Processing program and is funded by the Division of Chemistry and the   Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics of the Environmental Protection   Agency.   In addition, the project includes collaboration with research   scientists at the Ridgefield, Connecticut, laboratories of Boehringer   Ingelheim Corporation and Los Alamos National Laboratories.  Mark J. Burk   of the Chemistry Department, Duke University, will develop chemical   synthesis and processing technologies using carbon-dioxide based solvent   systems for asymmetric catalytic reactions.  Asymmetric hydrogenations,   hydrogen transfer reductions, and aldol condensations will be   investigated.    Chemical industry uses large volumes of organic and chlorinated solvents   which present serious disposal or recycling problems.  The utility of   carbon dioxide as a replacement solvent for the manufacture of fine   chemicals will be examined in this project.  Asymmetric catalysis is a   method that offers energy-efficient access to enantiometrically pure   intermediates for the synthesis of chiral drugs and agrochemicals.    Performing asymmetric catalysis in supercritical carbon dioxide   effectively combines the advantages of both to reduce chemical release in   manufacturing.",
