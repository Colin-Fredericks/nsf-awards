 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424018  Leslie-Pelecky    This REU Site award will provide support for thirteen  undergraduates to undertake research with 30 faculty members in  an interdepartmental, interdisciplinary research program through  the Center for Materials Research and Analysis and the EPSCoR  cluster on Nanostructured and Complex Materials, during an eleven  week summer program.  The program will preferentially recruit  students from the midwest and plains states, with an emphasis on  attracting highly qualified minority and women students.  Additional support for underrepresented groups will be available  through interactions with campus groups such as the Society of  Black Engineers and the Association for Women in Science's local  chapter.  Some of the primary research topics in nanostructured  materials include:  the correlation between magnetic properties  and microstructure in permanent magnet and magneto-optical  materials, ultrahigh density magnetic recording media, Langmuir  and Langmuir-Blodgett films, mechanically alloyed materials for  magnetic and structural applications, sputtering techniques for  the production of thin films and small particles, high  temperature superconductivity, and surface sciences.  %%%  This project will help undergraduates in physics, chemistry, and  engineering develop the research and professional skills  necessary for success as working scientists and engineers in the  high technological workplace.",
