Harry Swinney, University of  Texas, Austin, and Dr. Francisco Melo, Universidad  de  Santiago de Chile, on  the physics of granular flow.   The  researchers will conduct experiments on the formation of two-  dimensional spatial patterns in vertically oscillated  granular materials.  The formation and evolution of the  patterns will be studied using digital imaging techniques  and analyses  will examine the effects of energy  dissipation, air pressure, particle size, and forcing on the  collective motion .   The goal of the research is to develop  new insights towards a full understanding of the underlying  mechanism in the formation of the spatial patterns in these  granular materials.    Granular materials play an important role in industries such  as mining , agriculture, and construction, yet an  understanding of the fundamental processes governing the  collective behavior of  these materials is lacking.  The  proposed  collaborative research should make a fundamental  contribution to the understanding of the physics of granular  flow, and should help in understanding the role of  parameters that are varied in industrial processes involving  the granular flow.,  ***",
