 "awd_abstract_narration": "An opportunity is presented to investigate the feasibility of producing compact X-ray sterilizers that could be located in infectious waste producing centers where the daily production of medical waste is of the order of (10 kg. Potentially infectious medical waste would be converted into ordinary dry garbage which, following compaction, could be safely and locally disposed of as ordinary trash. These units would accept up to about half cubic foot of compacted or non-compacted medical waste. They would produce sterilization using irradiation by 1 MeV Bremsstrahlung radiation at the 1.5 to 2.0 MRad level in a period of about 4 hours to overnight. The present design concept of such units indicates that they promise to be as small as a household refrigerator. The product also promises to be reliable and sufficiently inexpensive such that, when produced in large numbers, they can be economically rented or sold.",
