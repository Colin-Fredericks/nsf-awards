 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501703  Lord  The main educational goals of this project are to further the  development of courses in the area of optoelectronic materials and  devices.  This includes:    1) Improving the required junior-level Electronics I and II  sequence by encompassing basic concepts of device physics and  adding more laboratories on optoelectronic devices.    2) Continuing the development of the lecture component of an  elective course on Optoelectronic Materials and Devices and adding  a laboratory to it.  These courses address such topics as crystal  growth, lasers, photodetectors, and fiber optic systems.    3) Developing a new elective course on Materials Characterization  for electrical engineers and other interested students.  Techniques  covered in this course would include atomic force microscopy (AFM),  photoluminescence (PL), and X-ray diffraction.    The main research goal of this project is to explore the growth of  lattice mismatched materials for long wavelength device operation.   Low temperature compositionally-graded buffer layers will be used  in the molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of lattice mismatched  materials to produce photodetectors at long wavelengths such as 2  um where lattice-matched materials are not available.  Different  profiles for accomplishing a compositionally-graded buffer layer  including linear composition grading, linear source temperature  grading, and small step grading will be compared.  Such materials  will be characterized using various techniques including atomic  force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence (PL), transmission,  photocurrent, and X-ray diffraction.  This research will contribute  significantly to the growth of a multitude of technologically  interesting materials on the relatively small number of available  high quality substrates.  ***",
