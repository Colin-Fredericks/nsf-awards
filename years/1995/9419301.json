 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419301  Lamb  Attempted infection by a non-pathogen or an avirulent form  of a pathogen can result not only in localized  hypersensitive resistance, but also in the development of  systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in which resistance to  normally virulent pathogens develops throughout the plant.  Establishment of SAR is associated with increases in cell  wall hydroxyproline levels and peroxidase activity, together  with the system expression of a subset of defense genes, but  the functional significance of these defenses in SAR has not  been established.  Induction of the systemic signals is  correlated with localized hypersensitive necrosis, and  salicylic acid is a component of the SAR mechanism although  it does not appear to be the systemic signal.    A system has been extablished for biological induction of  SAR in Arabidopsis (A. thaliana) by pre-challenge  inoculation with genetically well-defined bacterial  pathogens.  This system exhibits many of the features of  well-characterized SAR in tobacco and cucumber, and a  tractable mutant screen has been developed that in  preliminary studies resulted in the isolation, from a  population of 11,000 mutagenized plants, of 10 confirmed  mutants that exhibit local hypersensitive resistance but  fail to develop SAR.  It is now proposed to exploit the  tools available with Arabidopsis for genetic dissection of  SAR with the following specific objectives:    1.   Further physiological characterization of biologically  induced SAR in Arabidopsis.  2.   Analysis of hypersensitive resistance-defective mutants  to define the role of    localized hypersensitive necrosis  in the biological induction of SAR.  3.   Further develop the collection of SAR mutants from  mutagenized seeds of     Arabidospsis ecotype Col-O and T-  DNA taggd lines of ecotype Wassilewskija.  4.   Characterization of this developing collection of  mutants with respect to  dominance, complementation, and map  position.  5.   Use these mutants to delineate the signal pathway for   biological induction of SAR   by genetic and physiological  analysis of the sequence of gene action.  6.   Molecular cloning of SAR genes with an initial emphasis  on key genes for which   T-DNA tagged alleles have been  identified.",
