The general hypothesis, is that both, signal perception and  the ability to respond to signals determine if a  feeder/predator captures food/prey, or if the prey avoids or  escapes from the predator.  The ideas for this project were  triggered by (a) articles on sensory performance of  copepods, and (b) results from ongoing studies of behavior  of prey and predators.   In addition to major differences  between species, prior work has indicated a range of small  to major differences among developmental stages within  species.  Observation of behavior alone are insufficient to describe a  stage's or species' range of  capabilities to perceive and  capture food, and to perceive and avoid predators.  These  observations must be coupled with information regarding the  organisms' sensory physiology.  Therefore, this project will  examine: (a) the abundance and distribution of chemo-and  mechanosensors on the cephalic appendages of nauplii, early  copepodid stages, and adult females of five abundant species  of marine planktonic copepods; and (b) ontogenetic changes  in abundance and distribution of both sensor types using  data obtained through (a). The project will utilize Laser  Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM) to describe the sensor  distribution and orientation in 3-D (larger scale) and  sensor type (smaller scale) and Transmission Electron  Microscopy (TEM) to obtain ultrastructural information on  the major sensor types as confirmation of the LSCM  observations.    The significance of the proposed studies lies in improving  our understanding of what developmental stages and adult  females of abundant copepod species can perceive and what  they can not.  Perception of food and predators is crucial  for the existence of all species of planktonic copepods.  Combining data from static (structure) an d dynamic  (behavior) observation  should result in more than the sum  of both: relating information on coarse copepod morphology  (e.g. appendage size) to information on feeding behavior,  motion behavior sensor abundance and distribution, and  sensor ontogenetic changes should improve our understanding  (a) about how and why certain copepod species and stages can  exist in their respective environments, and (b) how they may  be phylogenetically related.  ***",
