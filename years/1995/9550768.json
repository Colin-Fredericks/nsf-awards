 "awd_abstract_narration": "Girls Incorporate of Metropolitan Dallas requests a 3-year grant  beginning in 1996 for Camp SMART (Science, Math and Relevant  Technology).  The camp is a collaborative project between Girls  Incorporated of Metropolitan Dallas, a nonprofit agency serving  adolescent girls, and the Hockaday School, a private girls' school.   Camp SMART is a math and science study program for minority girls  entering grades seven through nine.  Objectives includes:  o    To capture and increase participants' interest in mathematics,       the sciences and the technological applications of both;    o    To increase participants' awareness of career opportunities in       scientific, mathematical technological fields;    o    To provide participants with minority women role models, thus       helping them see themselves as scientists and mathematicians;    o    To improve participants' academic performance through exposure       to positive role models, specific instruction in study and       problem solving skills, and provision of support through the       academic year;    o    To enroll 45 minority participants annually.    Methods to be employed include a 4-week summer program and  activities throughout the academic year.  The summer program  consists of: 1) four 45-minute classes each morning in mathematics,  science, computers, and study and literacy skills; and 2) an  afternoon seminar on career exploration, which includes field trips  and presentations by professionals working in science and math  careers.  During the academic year, Camp SMART participants will  meet periodically for activities such as presentations by math and  science professionals and visits to local colleges.  Numerous  opportunities will be available throughout the course of the  project for participants to discuss their attitudes toward math and  science and changes in those attitudes resulting from participation  in Camp SMART.    Camp SMART contributes to the advancement of knowledge and  education by providing opportunities for i ntensive study of math  and science in unique environment.  The project opens opportunities  for minority girls to excel by providing them with hands-on  experiences with math and science as well as interactions with  people working in those fields.  ***",
