 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520977  Bardet  On January 17, 1995, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck the city  of Kobe in Japan, and inflicted the worst natural disaster to  Japan since the 1923 Tokyo Earthquake.    Some of the 10,000 buildings toppled by the quake were modern  structures. The modern port of Kobe was completely shut down,  mainly due to massive liquefaction of the soil foundations for  its wharves and container yards. The infrastructure of Kobe,  including railways, Shinkansen lines, expressways, and subways  was heavily damaged. There were more than 30 bridge failures in  the Hyogo Prefecture. The lifelines, including electricity, gas,  and water were severely disrupted in the city of Kobe.    Such a large scale disaster confronts engineers with the  devastating effects of an intensity 7 earthquake in a populated  area. The damage to Kobe transportation systems rendered access  difficult. Owing to the transportation problems and the large  scale damage to Kobe, foreign reconnaissance teams experienced  difficulties in assessing the earthquake damage.  There are many  geotechnical lessons to learn from this earthquake which can be  used to  avoid similar catastrophes in the US.    The objective of this project is to collaborate with the Japanese  reconnaissance teams in order to collect and release data about  the geotechnical features of the South Hyogo Prefecture  Earthquake, using the modern and efficient means of Internet  communication.  This new means of communication not only speeds  up the dissemination of critical information, but it also  promotes the exchange of information between US and Japan  earthquake engineers.    The Japanese Society of Soil Mechanics and Foundations has agreed  to collaborate with the principal investigator on the translation  of the Japanese reports into English, and to put these translated  reports on the GEOTECH Internet subscriber list and Mosaic Server  of the Southern California Earthquake Center. The information  will contain digitized strong motion recordings, map s, aerial  photographs, and photographs taken during field observations. All  this information will be made available to the US earthquake  engineering community as rapidly as possible in order to inform  them in a timely manner, and to help  them to take appropriate research actions to learn as much as is  possible from the South Hyogo Prefecture Earthquake.  ***",
