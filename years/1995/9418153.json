The  program sill allow for active participation by undergraduate  students in ongoing marine geologic research in Antarctica.   Students will be recruited from institutions across the United  States and will participate in a preparatory seminar on Antarctic  science prior to the field season.  This program will integrate  undergraduate participation with existing marine geology and  geophysics projects aboard either of the two United States  Antarctic Program research vessels, the RV Polar Duke and the RVIB  Nathaniel B. Palmer.  Research topics will be related to the  stratigraphy and/or evolution of the Antarctic continental margin,  topics of increasing importance to both Antarctic and global  geology.  Students will have a full year following their field  experience to conduct follow-up research via a senior thesis.  This  program is intended to provide better educational experiences to  promising undergraduate students and to stimulate those students to  pursue advanced degrees in geology and geophysics.  ***",
