The Principal  Investigator will develop and apply a dynamical many-body  method, based on Green's functions, in which he calculates  the charge transfer probabilities by solving a set of  coupled integro-differential equations.  The project  includes an investigation of the influence of substrate  temperature, particle velocity, atomic and molecular level  degeneracy, substrate band width, and substrate density of  states on charge transfer.  The results of this project  provide the theoretical background for an accurate  description of charge-transfer processes in atom/molecule-  surface collisions.  This formalism helps to interpret  specific experimental results and to relate microscopic  properties of the surface to actual experimental data.  %%%  This project develops of theory of the scattering and  colliding of atoms or molecules with metal surfaces.  The  main focus is on the transfer of charge between the surface  and the colliding particle.  Part of the project involves  the development of the complex quantum theory that one needs  to properly describe these collisions.  The project includes  an investigation of the influence of a variety of properties  of both the substrate and the colliding particle on charge  transfer.  This formalism helps to interpret specific  experimental results and to relate microscopic properties of  the surface to actual experimental data.  Such scattering  events are a primary way to measure various physical  properties of surfaces, the knowledge of which is necessary  to develop new and better materials.  ***",
