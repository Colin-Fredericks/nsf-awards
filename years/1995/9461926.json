 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops low-cost technological tools to enable students at the middle-school level to perform science experiments using computerized data collection and analysis. Such equipment is vital for learning and performing modern science. Tanner Research proposes to design rugged sensors and computer interfaces based on integrated circuits, thereby making them very inexpensive to produce in bulk, along with an easy-to-use software package that together will allow students to conduct hands-on science experiments using modern data collection methods. Tanner Research's in-house expertise in computer software and electronic hardware development, combined with both in-house and consultant experience in precollege education, make Tanner Research uniquely qualified to realize this goal. This Phase I effort concentrates on the initial specification and design of prototype sensor hardware and interactive software. These prototype materials will be integrated with segments of the science curriculum in use by collaborators in the Caltech Precollege Science Initiative (CAPSI). Phase II involves refinement of the initial prototypes, and field testing in collaboration with the CAPSI program.",
