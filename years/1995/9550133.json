 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research consists of coordinated imaging and spectroscopic  observations of comets during perihelion passage.  Images at 5-25  microns and spatially resolved long slit spectra of cometary dust  will be acquired with the mid-IR camera at the Mt. Lemmon  Observatory 1.5 m telescope, and with the new Long Wavelength  Spectrometer at the 10 m Keck telescope.  Such a compete set of  data has never been obtained for any comet.  The superior  capabilities of the LWS at Keck will allow us to observe the  pattern of the dust emittance in close proximity to the nucleus  which determines the morphology of the whole coma.  At Mt. Lemmon  we can study a larger field of view with longer temporal coverage  which is important for better understanding of the physical  characteristics of nuclei and comae.  We expect to learn new  details of the dust optical properties, composition, size  distribution and, finally, of cometary nuclei themselves.    Interactive activities include teaching of a high enrollment lower  division Physics class, and upper division course on a Solar System  Formation.  Other interactive commitments include:  inviting female  speakers to participate in the astrophysics seminar series, and  initiating a new program using UCSD TV which broadcasts to 10.6  viewers over the local area.  Interviews and panel discussion will  allow resident women scientists and visitors to discuss their  research and other issues relating to women in science.",
