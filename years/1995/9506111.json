However, the mechanism by which calcium in trapped and deposited in the matrix in an orderly fashion is not understood.  Present experiGeorge, Anne MCB-9506111 Biomineralization, the biogenic formation of mineral deposits, is one of the most widespread processes in nature.  All aspects of this mineral deposition are important, but attention has been focused on the processes in eukaryotes, where the mineral deposition at extracellular sites is clearly mediated and regulated by proteins and other components secreted by cells which are part of the matrix itself.  In matrix-mediated mineralization, the cells first form the structural components of the ECM (extracellular matrix) and then deliver regulatory macromolecules which modify the  properties of the matrix and lead to the location and stereospecific nucleation of mineral crystal.  Bone, dentin and cementum are the three principal mineralized tissues of vertebrates.  The present research program will use dentin formation as a model system.  In this system, the odontoblasts synthesize a structural matrix, comprised of collagen fibrils, which serves to define the basic architecture of the tissue product.  The cells also synthesize and deliver a number of acidic macromolecules into t he extracellular compartment.  Molecular biology technology has been applied to clone the acidic macromolecules.  The first macromolecule identified was DMP1 (dentin matrix protein 1).  Specific aims of the research program are directed toward an increased understanding of the structure and the function of DMP1 and its role in biomineralization. %%% Biomineralization is the process that occurs in animals and involves the formation of structures such as bone, claws, and dentin in teeth.  All of these structures are examples of  biomaterials.  In the present program, studies will be performed to begin to learn how these biomaterials are formed using dentin as a model system.  In the formation of dentin, cells called  odontoblasts  produce a structural network comprised of collagen fibrils, into which calcium is deposited to form the final, hard product.   However, the mechanism by which calcium in trapped and deposited in the matrix in an orderly fashion is not understood.  Present experimental results suggest that a number of proteins, also produced by the odontoblasts are involved.  By using molecular biology methods, one of these proteins has been isolated.  This acidic protein will be studied to learn how it combines with calcium and then operates to deposit it in the correct fashion to form dentin. ***                                                                                                                                                                                         ....()()))()()                                                                          ;                                                                     Oh     +'  0                                       D       h                                               @       d                                                           R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                   &    Metabolic Biochemistry Panel Summary                               Shelley A.
