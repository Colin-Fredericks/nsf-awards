These two regions represent important areas of geographical endemism for many of the species in the collection, represented by more than 650,000 specimens.  Because of its unique geographical coverage and history of excellent collection and curation, UAAM maintains the most important regional collection of insects from the Ozark and Ouachita interior Highlands. UAAM has recently added to its value as a scientific and educational resource with completion of the Insect Molecular Systematic Laboratory, and extensive computerization and linkage with Internet for database exchange these new facilities enable the museum to keep pace with the most recent developments in systematics.  However, a recent increase in the expansion rate of the collection (upwards of 10% in the last year) has created an immediate need for increased storage capacity.  In addition, the UAAM collection requires rearrangement to enhance storage efficiency and accessibility. An in crease in the capacity and upgrading of the hardware of the museum will be accomplished through the replacement of old wood cabinets by modern metal storage cabinets and the purchase of new cabinets designed for the safe and efficient storage of alcohol-preserved specimens in vials.  The reorganization will have an immediate impact on the appearance and ease of use of the collection by the museum staff and visiting scientists, as well as enhance the visibility of the display space for use by the local community.                         ;       S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       9509082                             Jethro Moorefield                   Jethro Moorefield           @     f  d                          @                                   @     f  d                                                                                                  @                                           Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      1                                                                                       ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          e =       e               b                       b                                       j       j   j       j       j       j       j                                                                       ;   1                                                                                               #                           l   T       =   ;                       j                                                                         ;               j       j                                                                       j               j                                       ~               j       j       j       j                           0                                                                                                 9509082 Whitfield  The University of Arkansas Arthropod Museum (UAAM) is located in the Ozark Plateau,  within a short distance of the Ouachita Highlands.
