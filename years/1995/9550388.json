 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, submitted under the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)  Program, is designed to investigate student, parent, and school factors that are related to mathematics and science enrollment and achievement in secondary schools.  The study will examine three sources of influence on the outcome variables of courses taken and achievement in science and mathematics in secondary schools:  Parental influence as indicated by parents' involvement, encouragement, and expectations; students' motivation and interest; and school influence as indicated by tracking and interest and access to information and guidance.  Further, gender and ethnicity-based differences will be investigated to  assess if enrollment in science and mathematics courses and achievement among women and minorities and differentially affected by these factors.    The education plan describes three main activities:  Teaching, curriculum development, and advising-mentioning.  The plan lists strategies that will lead to continual improvement in teaching and to the development of a \"personal pedagogy.\"  The development of  new courses will be guided by new knowledge and research in the field.  New courses in research methods and measurement will be application-oriented with an important part of the education.",
