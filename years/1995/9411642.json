 "awd_abstract_narration": "9411642  Corotis  Support is provided to continue research on extreme value  estimation procedures for the prediction of design wind  speeds.  During the first phase several available techniques  were tested and compared with some methods performing better  than others, e.g., for data from Gumbel and reverse Weibull  distributions the threshold approach performed better than  the epochal approach but the reverse was true for data from  a normal distribution.  During the second phase of the  research statistical analyses of data taken from maximum  daily fastest mile speeds and Monte Carlo simulations based  on the probabilistic models derived from these analyses will  be used.  The objectives of the work are: 1) to rank the  performances of the Cumulative Mean Excedance and the de  Haan-Dekkers-Einmahl estimation methods; 2) to account for  the seasonality effects; 3) to verify whether more extreme  speed data sets are in fact better fitted by reverse Weibull  than by Gumbel distributions; and 4) to estimate confidence  levels for \"peaks over threshold\" estimates of extreme winds  based on short records.  Long term wind speed data from  United States weather stations will be used to compare  epochal and threshold methods and to refine procedures for  determining design wind speeds.  The results from this work  will improve the survivability of structures built in  extreme wind areas and thus the safety of local population.  ***",
