 "awd_abstract_narration": "MP-IDEA focuses on precalculus classes and is supported by  industry partners and by an emerging network of regional  colleges. MP-IDEA has 4 components: (1) design precalculus  courses that are relevant, that are realistic, and that give  students skills and concepts to succeed in future math courses  and in the workplace; (2) incorporate the intelligent use of  modern technology into the math classroom, specifically, graphing  calculators and computers; (3) incorporate alternative assessment  practices in the mathematics classroom, specifically, the  introduction of industry-based student research projects; (4)  incorporate cooperative learning techniques in the mathematics  classroom, thus improving student attitudes, achievement, and  interpersonal skills. This project improves mathematics  instruction, implements six recommendations of the SCANS report,  and serves as a regional model for improvement in postsecondary  mathematics instruction. An exceptional element of MP-IDEA is  educational partnerships with engineers and scientists at  regional industries.  These volunteers consult with MP-IDEA  faculty to write industry-based math projects specific to the  math that students in precalculus courses are learning.  The math  projects encourage cooperative learning, introduce students to  modern technology, and provide a relevant means of assessing  student learning.",
