Examples of problems that are to be investigated include the  stochastic models of the traveling salesman problem, the minimum  spanning tree problem, and several of  their related  approximations. The more specific objectives of the project  include (1) further development of the  distribution theory for  the traveling salesman problem and minimal spanning tree problem,  (2) more extensive development of Talagrand's theory of  configuration functions, (3) refined understanding of the tail  behavior of the increasing subsequence functional, and (4)  development of the basic limit theory for functionals associated  with non-optimal heuristics. The methods that will be used in  this investigation include Talagrand's isoperimetric theory,   Talagrand's theory of irregularity of distribution, the theory of  subadditive Euclidean functionals, the general efficiency theory  for statistical estimation, and  the theory of vector  quantization.  Each of these tools is of considerable importance  in its own right, and the expectation is that  useful insight  will be gained into the strengths and weaknesses of these tools  through the study of the concrete problems of  probabilistic  combinatorial optimization.     The interface of probability  theory and optimization has experienced remarkable growth over  the last five years, and this development has had substantial  impact on both theoretical computer science and the  practice of  algorithm development. The aim of this project is to build a  deeper understanding of the information and assistance that  probability can provide in some difficult and important problems  of computation. In particular, the project aims to develop  probability theory that helps describe the behavior of several  important quantities in the theory of combinatorial optimization,  a subj ect that studies the minimization and maximization of  functions that are defined very large finite sets. The more  specific objectives of the project include development of a  distribution theory for the length of the shortest path through a  large number of points whose locations are determined by a  probability distribution, and the  development of the basic  probability for some of the most  important approximation methods  of optimization theory.",
