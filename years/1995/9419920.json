 "awd_abstract_narration": "Purchase of a computer-asslsted light microscope for digital data  acquisition and analysis is  proposed. The sytem consists of a light microscope, the stage of which  is precisely controlled by stepping motors in three dimensions via a PC  interface. This control provides a vectorial, threedimensional  representation in computer memory, the most efficient means of storing  and manipulating ob~ects spanning the scale (from less than micron to  several millimeters) of a neuron and all its extended processes. The  system will be used to: 1) provide three-dimensional reconstruction of  the dendritic trees and and axonal arborizations of selectively stained  neurons; and 2) to precisely plot and count selectively stained neurons  in a cytoarchitectonic context. Data are acquired using either video or  optical overlays. The optical mode uses a miniture cathode ray tube  projected directly into the oculars and is best for the highest  resolution tracing; the video mode will employ a color camera which  will be useful with fluorescent markers. Users will choose between  acquisition modes via software switches, even within a session and  while tracing the same ob~ect. The software support includes analysis  programs for extracting quantitative information such as length,  diameter, branching and spine density of processes and for displaying  three-dimensional reconstructions. Analysis of images can be performed  routinely in the user's own labs, since the software runs on PCs and  Macintoshes which make up the user computer base. Also, the station  will communicate over an existing Ethemet network to which all users  are connected. The network wlll allow rapid data transfer from the  station to individual labs, and provide additional analysis options by  remote operation of software on existing larger computers in the  department..    The station is designed to faciliate ongoing studies of the complex  structure and function of nerve cells. A range of projects will be  supported, including: 1) determini ng the morphological differences  between oxytocin and vasopressin neurons and their neurohypophysial  axon arborization as a function of secretory state; 2) understanding  corticostriatal axon divergence and convergence, in particular their  relation to the dendritic branching of striatal neurons and to  cytoarchitectonic boundaries; 3) determining the role of adhesion  molecules in axonal guidance; 4) determining whether functional  plasticity in somatosensory cortex is accompanied by changes in  cortical neuron morphology; 5) understanding the normal organization of  neurons in the basal ganglia and the selectivity of cell loss in  neurodegenerative disease.",
