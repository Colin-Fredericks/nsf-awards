 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521494  Miller   Ductile regime grinding is the term used to describe grinding high performance materials like ceramics, so that the material removal mechanism is primarily deformation, not brittle cracking with the attendant sub surface damage.  This type of material removal has been studied and documented, particularly for grinding lenses.  However, general adoption by  industry requires innovative ways to improve productivity while minimizing surface damage.  This research planning grant will investigate ways to improve material removal rates, and identify performance requirements for applications other than ceramics.  Two ways to improve material removal rates will be investigated experimentally.  The first will use optimized abrasive wheels with small grits for the small chips characteristic of ductile regime grinding, and large grits to prevent loading.  The way to enhance material removal will use ultrasonic excitation to mechanically change the grit size.   A literature review and industrial visits will be used to identify performance requirements for non-optics applications.     Successful completion of this project will lead to higher productivity in processing ceramics suitable for a wider class of applications.  This award will also encourage the diversity needed in the manufacturing research community.  ***",
