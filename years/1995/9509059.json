 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509059   Langford   This is a Small Business Innovation Research Phase II award to support a project to develop and  demonstrate a two-way, low-cost airborne science data relay.  The company identified a need for a lightweight, low-cost, bi-directional communications link for science  aircraft.  Phase I of the project investigated atmospheric  science user requirements for data relay and mission control.  The feasibility of using low-Earth  orbit communications satellites to meet these requirements was demonstrated through ground  testing of a brassboard system.  In demonstrating this system, it was discovered that  straightforward data relay to the first visible satellite does not always provide minimum message  transmission time.  In order to ensure the most timely delivery of science and mission data, a \"SmartLink\" scheduler for use with the ORBCOMM system was developed.    Phase II will implement a real-time version of the scheduler, install the system into a UAV  communications package, and conduct over-the-horizon flight tests.   The SmartLink scheduler, integrated into ORBCOMM transceivers, will be used first for  unmanned scientific aircraft;  however, it also can provide a low-cost Internet link for manned  aircraft.  Any operation requiring low-cost, short latency, Internet communication with a remote  site will benefit from this product and is a potential customer.",
