 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of environmental engineering is faced with the  remediation of soil and groundwater that have been contaminated  with toxic organic compounds.   Remediation methods would  prioritize techniques that destroy the compounds instead of  merely shifting them to another medium.   Bioremediation, the  degradation of such compounds by micro-organisms, is a method  that is being chosen for soil and groundwater remediation with  increasing frequency.   Bioremediation is an interdisciplinary  field, requiring individuals who have received training in both  microbial physiology and ecology, as well as in engineering.    This project is directed at preparing students to be able to  design engineered systems that provide micro-organisms with  engineered conditions that are conducive to the biodegradation of  toxic organic compounds.    The emphasis in the class on  Bioremediation Engineering is on the analysis of microbial  kinetics and application of laboratory kinetic studies to full-  scale design.   Biodegradation rates in aerobic environments are  measured with a respirometer because of simplicity of operation  and automatic data collection capability of the respirometer.    Biodegradation rates in anaerobic environments are also  investigated.   A microscope is employed to demonstrate microbial  morphology.   The impact of the project is the training of a  large number of individuals with a bachelor of science in  Environmental Engineering in bioremediation techniques.",
