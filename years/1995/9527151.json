 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this research is the development of   high-performance problem solving environment (PSE) for the    optimization and  control of chemical and biological processes,  with initial   emphasis on  bioengineering applications.  The  optimization and control   of such processes  requires the  repetitive solution of time-dependent partial   equations (PDEs) in two or three spatial dimensions.  The    requirements of this problem, which must be solved    interactively, can only be  met by the use of massively parallel  computers.  Such a   comprehensive and  powerful PSE does not  currently exist, and its development   presents significant  computational and computer science challenges.    The initial   application is  the design and optimization of a  small diameter   bioartificial artery.  Over  600,000 surgical  procedures for blood vessel replacement are   conducted in the  U.S.  annually, many involving synthetic polymer substitutes   for small  diameter  blood vessels that fail due to lack of biocompatability,    which is not an issue  for bioartificial arteries.  A PDE model  based on continuum   mechanical theory  that describes the  distribution of cells, fibers, and   stresses in a tissue will  be  used to simulate the evolving compaction of a   bioartificial  artery.  Optimization of the ultimate properties of the  bioartificial   artery is sought,  in particular the ability to  withstand pulsatile arterial   pressure.  PDE  systems of a  similar mathematical structure commonly arise   as models for  chemical processes with a need for their control and    optimization.  The project  includes collaboration with and input  from scientists and   engineers at several  industrial and  government laboratories with applications in   processing.    To optimize or control a process described by   PDEs, the original  time interval is divided into subintervals in a multiple-  shooting  type  approach.  The PDEs on each subinterval are discretized in    space via parallel  adaptive finite el ement methods to give a  large system of   algebraic equations (DAEs).  Parameters or control variables   are then optimized,  subject to  state and control variable and continuity   constraints (equality  and  inequality) using large-scale nonlinear programming    techniques.  Extensive  knowledge and research experience in  adaptive methods for   PDEs, DAEs,  large-scale optimization,  parallel computing, computing   environments, and  chemical  and biological processes, are required to   successfully develop  such a  PSE.  The reaerch team members cover this broad  range of   expertise, and have a successful record of  collaboration   with each other.",
