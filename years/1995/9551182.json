 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central goal of the Geography Department is to provide all  students with skills in collecting, analyzing, and presenting data.    Despite some success in achieving this goal, students receive  little training in geographic information systems (GIS).   This  concern is shared with the Geology and Biology Departments, who  also recognize the growing importance of GIS in their disciplines.    Our objective is to provide a wide cross-section of undergraduate  students with interdisciplinary exposure to GIS such that they can  use this technology after leaving the university and can engage in  independent research that involves GIS.   The plan to meet this  objective has three components and involves efforts by the  Geography, Geology, and Biology Departments.   First, a  cross-listed course is being developed specifically addressing the  theoretical and applied issues of GIS.   This course forms the core  of GIS education.   Second, independent student research that uses  GIS is being encouraged.   Such projects include community-based  outreach work with the Madison County, NY, Planning Agency and  environmental studies at the university.   Third, existing courses  are being modified to include lectures and exercises involving GIS.",
