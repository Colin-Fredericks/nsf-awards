 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zedeno    With National Science Foundation support Dr. Maria Zedeno will  analyze a sample of archaeological ceramics from the site of  Point of Pines located in east-central Arizona. The site saw the  development of large multi-ethnic communities between ca. AD 1250  to 1400. It presents a strong prehistoric case for migration and  co-residence and well dated architecture and human remains  provide a secure background for the proposed ceramic study. Dr.  Zedeno will identify local ceramic traditions, nonlocal ceramics  obtained before migration occurred, nonlocal ceramics associated  with immigration episodes, local manufacture of foreign pots, and  development of hybrid technologies. This will be accomplished  through the application of neutron activation and petrographic  analyses to 20 samples of decorated and plainware shreds and the  reconstruction of manufacturing technology. A survey to identify  and sample raw material sources will also be conducted.     One goal of archaeologists is to trace the movement and  intermingling of different cultural groups and often this is  extremely difficult to do given the limited nature of the  archaeological record. The Point of Pines region is important  because data derived from a number of sources indicates that just  such immigration and mingling did occur. Because of its  widespread use and its durability, abundant pottery remains are  recovered on many sites and Dr. Zedeno will use the controlled  Point of Pines situation to determine how ceramics are affected  by these social processes. The work is important not for the  information it will provide about this site but because the  insight gained will provide a useful archaeological tool which  can be used to analyze ceramics in many parts of the world. The  potential impact of this research is extremely broad.",
