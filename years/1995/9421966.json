The  theory requires taking into account simultaneously the  interaction of electrons with intense electromagnetic  fields, the interaction among the electrons, and the  interaction of the electron with its host environment.  Special attention is paid to the interplay between the  polarization of light and the spin dynamics of the  electrons.  The following systems will be studied:  III-V  nonmagnetic semiconductor heterostructures (promising  systems for optoelectronic devices), II-VI magnetic  semiconductor heterostructures (important for visible  optical and magneto-optical devices), and light element  compounds (exhibit properties of strongly correlated  electrons).  The approach adopted is field theoretic, with a  diagrammatic representation.  The results are expected to be  a unified explanation for a wide range of observed nonlinear  optical phenomena in each class of these solid state  systems, predictions of new behavior, and a deeper  understanding of strong electron correlation through optical  processes which can test electron theories.  %%%   This work involves modeling the interaction of light with  several solid systems, including layered (composite)  semiconducting systems and light element compounds.  This  interaction provides a means of measuring the electronic  properties in these systems and forms a basis for making  ultrafast optical devices.  The light interacts with  the  electronic properties in certain classes to be studied and  with magnetic properties in others.  The results are  expected to be a unified explanation for a wide range of  observed nonlinear optical phenomena in three classes of  solid state systems, predictions of new behavior, and a  deeper understanding of the electron-electron interactions,  which are a key to the theory behind many materials.  ***",
