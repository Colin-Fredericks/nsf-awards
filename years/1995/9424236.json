 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kramer    Under the direction of Dr. Carol Kramer, Mr. Adam Smith will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will study Urartu  settlement pattern as revealed in a series of archaeological  sites. Between the ninth and sixth centuries B.C., the ancient  state of Urartu spread from its capital on Lake Van, conquering  much of what is today eastern Turkey, Armenia and Iranian  Azerbaijan. As it expanded, Urartu imposed a new spatial order on  the territories it acquired. In his research, Mr. Smith will  study an number of sites in Armenia. These span a range of time  and include both pre-Urartu, early and late Urartu settlements.  He will employ an electronic mapping system to construct accurate  site plans and supplement these data with schematic drawings on  artifacts from Urartu sites. On this basis he will determine how  imperial control is both reflected in and reinforced by  architectural arrangement. He will study the use of space and the  control of access into specific areas.    This research is of interest for several reasons. First, it will  shed light on the development of state level societies in a  poorly known portion of the world. Secondly, it will help to  develop an analytic technique with the potential for widespread  archaeological use. Finally it will assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.",
