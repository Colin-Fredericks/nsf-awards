Professor Rytas Vilgalys of Duke University is studying  the patterns of species differences in the genus throughout its  worldwide distribution.  Conventional taxonomic study of morphology  and of mating systems is being combined with modern analyses of  nuclear ribosomal gene sequences, using numerous samples collected  from field trips and from colleagues.  Laboratory growth studies  will be performed to determine mating systems and the limits of  intersterility groups.  A simple yet ingenious \"spore trapping\"  technique is also being employed, whereby petri dishes with several  tester strains are exposed for 48 hours to the local spore rain and  results of hyphal fusion monitored.  Concurrent molecular analyses  focus on DNA sequence data derived from the worldwide sample of  Pleurotus.  Results of the studies will help answer several  questions relevant to speciation in fungi: (1) how old are  different species groups, under a molecular clock model; (2) what  are the genealogical or phylogenetic relationships among the  species; and (3) what are the relationships between geographic  distribution and levels of morphological, molecular, and mating  system variability.       By providing comprehensive taxonomic descriptions for each  species from geographically diverse regions, the study will also  provide a baseline for developing commercially useful strains of  oyster mushrooms for cultivation and biotechnology.",
