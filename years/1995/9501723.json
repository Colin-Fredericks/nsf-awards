 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501723  Bayer    This awards supports the research of Professor D. Bayer to work  on  methods for computing in both algebraic geometry and topology. In  algebraic geometry he will focus on the connections between toric  varieties and integer programming. In topology he will study  methods to compute on 3-manifolds. He hopes to use the interplay  between topology and algebraic geometry such as the  interpretation  of the Haken normal surface as a Hilbert basis for a polyhedral  cone. Finally he proposes to develop virtual reality software for  direct manipulation of 3-manifolds.    The research starts out in algebraic geometry and then moves on  to  topology. Both are among the oldest parts of modern mathematics,  but both have blossomed to the point where they have, in the past  10 years, solved problems that have stood for centuries.  Originally, Algebraic Geometry treated figures defined in the  plane  by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the  field  uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and  topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields,  but it has applications to many areas of engineering as well.   The  research supported in the present proposal shows the importance  of  this once purely theoretical area for robotics and manufacturing.  Topology studies the properties of objects that are invariant  under  transformations that do not tear the surface. It is extensively  used in such areas as Physics and Chemistry where the shapes of  objects are fundamental to determine their properties.  ***",
