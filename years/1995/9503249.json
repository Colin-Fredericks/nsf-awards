 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503249  Donagi    Professor Donagi will study problems that derive from the  interaction of algebraic geometry with the theory of integrable  systems. In particular, he will study mirror symmetry, normal  functions of curves in their Jacobians, the geometpic Langlands  conjecture and the compatibility of connections of non-abelian  theta functions with an abelianized version.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, yet it  directly connects to two of the great advances in theoretical  physics in this century--quantum mechanics and general  relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts  of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary  flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated  figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest  equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of  methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology,  and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as  in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.  ***",
