Enhanced electrical conductivity at  low temperatures relative to conventional polycrystalline  material is expected due to grain size-dependent  nonstoichiometry as a result of impinging space charge  layers.  The effects of grain size, temperature, and oxygen  partial pressure on de and ac conductivity will be evaluated  for cryochemically synthesized, highly dense nanoscale  titanium (grain size < 30 nm), both pure and doped with  donor and acceptor solutes.  Impedance spectroscopy and  quantitative microanalysis will be used in parallel to  establish correlations between grain boundary and bulk  conductivity and chemistry, from which a unified model of  defect chemistry in ultrafine-grained nonstoichiometric  oxides will be developed.  %%%  The goal of this research is to develop a scientific basis  for the understanding of nanoscale ceramics with novel  electrical properties.  Innovative uses of active and  cooperative learning, student team work, and peer-assisted  instruction will be developed and assessed quantitatively  for several courses, with a concentrated effort in  Introduction to Materials Science.  In addition, the  possibility of a cross-disciplinary team master's thesis as  an innovative approach to graduate training will be  explored.  A long-term objective is to provide leadership at  the local and national level in understanding the \"pipeline\"  issues that continue to result in an underrepresentation of  women in science and engineering.",
