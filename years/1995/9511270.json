 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to investigate syntactic ambiguity  resolution in normal, adult language comprehension. The study of  ambiguity resolution can illuminate the architecture of the  language comprehension system and can evaluate the  psycholinguistic and linguistic theories concerning the nature of  linguistic mental representations.       The theoretical framework of the investigation is a lexical,  \"constraint-based\" framework in which syntactic ambiguity is seen  as a type of lexical ambiguity, such that syntactic ambiguity  resolution has the same properties as the resolution of lexical  semantic ambiguities. This approach has been applied profitably  to the analysis of several \"classic\" syntactic ambiguities in  English that had previously been taken as evidence for a  radically different processing architecture.        The experiments use self-paced reading methods and eye  fixation monitoring to study ambiguity resolution and constraint  use. A large amount of normative data is also collected  concerning the strength of the constraints, and regression  methods are used to determine the extent to which difference  constraints affect comprehenders' interpretations at different  points in time.       The research is significant in that it advances a unified  account of language comprehension in which representation at all  levels (phonological, lexical, syntactic, discourse, etc.) are  governed by the same basic properties, including frequency  sensitivity and activation of representations via constraint  satisfaction. A unified account of language representation  affects not only theories of human language use, but also work in  artificial intelligence, which to date has generally reflected  the more traditional theories of human language comprehension.  Our understanding in the unified approach of human ambiguity  resolution could therefore have substantial impact on computer  natural language comprehension research, particularly the very  difficult problem of ambiguity resolut ion in these systems.",
