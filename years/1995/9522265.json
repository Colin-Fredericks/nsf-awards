Three new courses will be introduced, and a fourth is being planned. Three existing undergraduate hardware courses will be revised to included new information on the use of design tools, and design automation theory. The first objective is to teach students how to use design tools, while the second is to teach students how to actively participate in the development of new tools. The final products will be a set of course outlines with detailed guidelines and design-oriented exercises; a set of laboratory manuals providing exercises in creating complex designs and making modifications to existing designs; a set of complex designs to be used either as examples or as the basis for exercises in design modifications; a set of highly sophisticated and completely integrated design tools that will carry the student from the initial inception of an idea through to its implementation; and a set of new textbooks aimed at the problems of design and the use of design automation. Results will be made available through scholarly publications, Internet newsgroups and anonymous FTP, and through a series of summer workshops.  ***",
