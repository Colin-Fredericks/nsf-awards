 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503301  Farhat  The accurate prediction of aeroelastic phenomena is essential to the design of safe high performance aircraft.  This prediction requires solving simultaneously the appropriately coupled fluid and structural equations of motion.  Therefore, numerical aeroelastic simulations are in general resource intensive. We propose to develop high performance methodologies for the parallel simulation of three-dimensional transient aeroelastic problems on advanced homogenous and heterogeneous hardware architectures. More specifically, we intend to develop mixed partitioning procedures for the parallel space and time integration of the governing coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, and investigate their merits in terms of accuracy, stability, heterogeneous computing, I/O transfers, subcycling, and parallel processing.  This research is multidisciplinary and includes four components: computational structural mechanics, computational fluid dynamics, applied mathematics and numerical analysis and, computer sciences and parallel processing.  The first two components involve the development of discrete mathematical models based on finite elements and finite volumes for representing aerospace structures as assemblies of beams, plates, and shells, and modeling high speed flows around them.  The third component addresses the design of staggered and efficient time-integrators for advancing the solution of the governing coupled semi-discrete equations.  The last research component aims at exploiting the capabilities of homogeneous and heterogeneous parallel systems to significantly reduce the overall simulation time of these very compute-intensive engineering applications.",
