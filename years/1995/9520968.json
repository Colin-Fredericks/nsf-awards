The conference will present a  research-oriented conference-workshop within the context of NASTO  `95.  The invited speakers will discuss current research  projects, discuss the state-of-practice in their respective  countries and institutions, and share knowledge about the impact  that transportation issues have had in their particular setting.  The interaction amongst the researcher, and between them and the  policy makers and their technical staff, all from different  countries and backgrounds but facing similar problems, will allow  useful exchanges of information, help to set meaningful research  priorities, and stimulate collaborative projects.    The papers presented, the formal and informal discussions, and  the resulting proceedings will provide an excellent technology  transfer mechanism.  The event will provide a valuable  opportunity to strengthen ties and establish new connections  between participants from North and South America.  The  conference will also directly benefit students from the  University of Puerto Rico, who will have an opportunity to learn  from the presentations and interact with the participants.  ***",
