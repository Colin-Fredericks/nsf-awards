 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Sylvester  DMS-9423849    Sylvester will continue his research on inverse problems in partial differential and ordinary differential equations, as they relate to the determination of the properties of inhomogeneous media from measurements made on or near the outer boundary.  Applications include medical imaging, radar imaging, and acoustical imaging in layered and non-layered media.  The goal is to develop a mathematically rigorous and numerically stable layer stripping algorithm, first in one, and then in two and three dimensions.    Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.",
