Two groups of 35 teachers from  the Twin Cities area receive 18 months training each.  This  includes three weeks in each of two consecutive summer summers  and periodic sessions during the school year.  Participants work  in teams of three from schools or districts and support, enrich,  and reinforce each other.  These teams in turn train other  teachers through a variety of workshops, seminars, and classes  held around the state and region.  They develop discipline-based  activities which are shared with their colleagues and made  available on the Internet nationwide.      Continued support for the project is anticipated because both  ECSU and TIES, the project partners, are established region  service organizations which work closely with school districts,  colleges and universities as well as local businesses and  industries.  The project includes involvement from many  businesses in the area, all working to support the project  through speakers, site visits, resources, mentors, and other  methods.    Cost sharing on the project is 100%.  ***",
