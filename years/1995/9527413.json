 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    This award is to allow participation by US researchers in a  workshop aimed at establishing a framework for producing a  magnetic anomaly map and magnetic digital data base for the  Antarctic.  The workshop will be held with the collaboration of  the British Antarctic Survey at Griton College, Cambridge (UK)  over 18-19 September 1995.  The workshop will establish: 1) the  geologic requirements for the Antarctic map and data base; 2)  conditions of data contributions;  3) formats for the data base  and map; 4) where compilation efforts will take place; and 5)  conditions of data release.  A report covering these points, as  well as a strategy for implementing compilation efforts, will  result from this workshop.    The US, through the Office of Polar Programs at the National  Science Foundation, maintains a strong research program in  Antarctic earth sciences.  Representation in this meeting is in  the best interests of both the US research community and the US  Antarctic Program's Polar Earth Sciences Program.  Furthermore,  the Antarctic Treaty requires each member nation to share and  disseminate information resulting from Antarctic research  activities.  Participation of US researchers in this meeting is  important to the data dissemination goals of the Antarctic  Treaty.",
