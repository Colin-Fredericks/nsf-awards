 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527421  Kieda       Showers produced by the highest energy cosmic ray  primaries, with energy above 10 GeV have been observed in  scintillator and Cerenkov arrays and the Fly's Eye.  the  former detects shower components, the latter their  fluorescence produced in the atmosphere.  Both techniques  have limited aperture not likely to be substantially  increased because of cost.  This grant funds a new approach  that may provide substantially larger aperture with  comparable resolution at significantly lower cost than is  possible with conventional methods.  Calculations show that  Cerenkov light emitted by the shower particles is intense  enough to produce detectable signals (perhaps even in  daylight!) in non-imaging planar detectors arrayed on the  ground.  Of the various candidate technologies, single-  crystal CZ-Si solar panels, will be the focus of the  research, those being readily available and relatively  inexpensive.  This novel idea will be tested with  measurements of the sensitivity of the solar panels  and  other possible detectors and with an instrumented small set  of panels at the site of the CASA/MIA/HiRes cosmic-ray  detector system to detect showers in coincidence with it.  ***",
