The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Orin D. Gensler to work with Professor Bernd  Heine at the Institut fur Afrikanistik at the Universitat zu  Koln in Cologne, Germany.    The goal of this project is to learn the Cushitic languages  and linguistics, specifically Cushitic syntax in an  Afroasiatic and East African context.  This work will build  on Gensler's previous work in which he assembled detailed  information from 18 African languages, in a balanced  continent-wide sample, including several East African  languages, among them one Cushitic language, Afar.  This  data has been useful in a purely African context as a  typological mini-database for areal work.  Now he will  approach Cushitic as a member of an East African Sprachbund.  The linguistic link between Ethiopic and Cushitic is a  matter of areal and genetic considerations which provide a  classic example of undisputed substratal influence.  This  year will lay the ground work for future field work on a  Cushitic (or Omotic) language in East Africa, where there  are many ill-described or undescribed languages, some which  are on the verge of extinction. ***",
