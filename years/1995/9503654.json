Work to be performed represents  preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project named  SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic  Ocean and its impact on global change.  The primary goals of SHEBA  are: (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic   ocean-atmosphere-ice processes that demonstrably improve  simulations of the present day arctic climate, including its  variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to  improve the interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the  Arctic for analysis of the arctic climate system and provide  reliable data for model input, model validation and climate monitoring.     This work will develop, construct, and prepare for deployment two  new instruments that will be built  specifically for autonomous  operation at the main SHEBA ice camp.  These are a wind profiler  to provide wind and temperature profiles continuously to 2.5 km  altitude; and a lidar for cloud and aerosol  monitoring which will  measure optical depth and provide ice/water determinations.  The  instruments will be designed to optimize performance under Arctic  conditions.  This instrumentation will be useful in addressing an  identified critical issue of SHEBA, the sea arctic cloud- radiation feedback mechanism.",
