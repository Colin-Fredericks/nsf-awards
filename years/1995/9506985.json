It has been shown that  the nuclear Ras-like GTP-binding protein Ran and its  nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 form a complex that is  critical for a number of nuclear functions, including entry  into and progression of DNA replication, and entry into cell  division.  Mutations in either Ran or RCC1 have complex  phenotypes in animal and yeast cells and affect many  processes, including DNA synthesis and gene expression,  often resulting in cell death.  This project is an  investigation of the functions of Ran and RCC1 in plant cell  division and sexual reproduction.  The proposed studies of  the Ran/RCC1 regulatory complex in a multicellular system  that is amenable to in vivo manipulations should reveal  novel and as yet poorly understood functions for these  conserved proteins.  Preliminary data indicate that plant  Ran is a highly conserved nuclear protein which can suppress  a fission yeast cell cycle mutation.  Ran is encoded by a  family of genes in tomato whose members are differentially  expressed.  The function of Ran and RCC1 in tomato plants  will be investigated using transgenic tomato plants  expressing mutant Ran proteins in an inducible fashion.  This is a novel and powerful tool to investigate the role of  these proteins in development.  In addition, the subcellular  distribution and function of the proteins during cell  division and sexual reproduction are not understood.  Plant  cells present a useful genetic system for such functional  and localization studies.  Together, these experiments  establish an important basis for studies to understand the  function of the Ran/RCC1 regulatory complex in a signal  transduction network that regulates the integration of cell  growth and cell division  %%%  During entry into any phase of  the cell cycle, there are  complex and diverse functions which must be coor dinated. The  phase which leads to initiation of  mitosis, the M phase of  the cell cyle,  requires, and to some degree may be driven  by, multiple activities, some of which involve the Ran gene  product and its associated RCC1 gene product. However, the  work to date on these genes has been done primarily in yeast  and mammalian systems.  This work pulls together the  suggestive  previous work done in yeast and mammalian cell  tissue culture and provides a means to determine definitive  functions of this gene complex through the use of  transgenic technologies in tomato and Arabidopsis plants.  Work has already shown that the genes for Ran/RCC1 in plants  are very similar to those found in yeast and mammals.  The  work also shows that the plant genes can functionally  replace non-functional genes in yeast.  Ending these studies  to plants takes advantage of the multiple known plant  mutations in meiosis, the \"reduction\" division which gives  rise to sexual gametes.  The commonality between the early  phases of mitosis and meiosis would indicate that the  definitive role for these proteins might be uncovered by  exploiting advanced knowledge in this area of plant biology.  Extending the work to plants also takes advantage of the  \"naturally\" occuring cell cycle arrest points and activity  in a mature, differentiated higher plant.  Discovery of the  role of  the Ran/RCC1 regulatory complex in the signal  transduction network involved in the normal development of  plants should provide a deeper of understanding of how these  very basic, common signaling mechanisms are coordinated  during plant, animal and fungal growth.  ***",
