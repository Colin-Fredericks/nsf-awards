 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9500881  Huang    Huang will study the mapping problems for real hypersurfaces in complex spaces and try to prove various regularity results for Cauchy-Riemann mappings.  He will investigate the smooth and analytic structure of a real submanifold in the complex space and the structure of its local hull of holomorphy.  Also he will explore the Kobayashi extremal mappings of bounded domains in complex n-space and their applications to the study of holomorphic self-mappings.    Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the century  as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one complex  variable.  It became clear early on that the theory differed  widely from it predecessor.  The underlying geometry was far more  difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity  with partial differential operators of first order.  It thus grew  as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics of  differential geometry and differential equations.  Many of the  fundamental structures were defined in the last three decades.   Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic  mathematical forms.",
