 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506622  DREGER     This research is to extend modern techniques of analysis of large  earthquakes in southern and central California back to historical  times when only analog seismographic recordings were available.   While many of these regions are currently quiet, especially off of  the San Andreas fault, several historic large earthquakes have  occurred there and these are important to the estimation of seismic  hazard.  The longest-lived seismic stations in California are the  Berkeley BRK and MHC (since 1887), and the Caltech PAS and SBC  (since 1927) stations.  In addition, seismograms will be obtained  from other regional and teleseismic sites such as the De Bilt,  Netherlands and the Florissant, Missouri observatories.  The  technique involves the use of recent earthquakes recorded by modern  networks to compare with the historic data to obtain relative  locations, magnitude scaling, and to calibrate paths to each  station.  The resulting calibrated Green's functions will be used  to model the historic events for source depth, scalar seismic  moment, fault orientation and potential source complexity in the  larger historic earthquakes.  This research is a component of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.    ***",
