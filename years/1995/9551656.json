 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two fundamental tasks of laboratory education are (1) to engage  students in the processes of science and (2) to communicate  scientific information effectively.   To accomplish these tasks,  educators must keep pace with current trends in science  education.   Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) is such a trend.    Computers are laboratory tools important in data acquisition and  analysis.   They are communication tools in the rapidly growing  field of information technology.    The objective of this project  is to improve laboratory science education with the installation  of a networked multimedia laboratory.   Students acquire skills  with modern information technologies by using them to learn  science.   These technologies are being implemented in a  prototype program (Human Anatomy/Physiology Learning Program or  HALP), using innovative teaching approaches documented in the  literature.   Laboratory instruction incorporates interactive  multimedia, computer-assisted data analysis, and on-line  information retrieval.   This project improves and updates  undergraduate laboratory science education at college.   It  produces better-educated science students; that is, students who  are capable of using information technologies, who are excited  about science, and who have succeeded in learning science.",
