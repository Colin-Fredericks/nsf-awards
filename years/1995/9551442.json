 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the laboratory experiences in two classes,  an introductory earth systems science course and an upper-level  geochemistry course, are redesigned.   Both courses emphasize the  behavior and interrelationships of natural systems and  demonstrate to students the power of a quantitative approach to  problem-solving in science.   By combining simple physical models  with mathematical modeling (for upper-level students) and simple  computer modeling (both levels), students not only gain a deeper  understanding of the particular system they've studied, but gain  insight into an entire class of problems with many practical  applications.   In the intro-level course, students build  identical physical and computer models of a one-box dynamical  system.   This approach has several advantages:  (1) Students  gain confidence in computer modeling by working with a system  that they already understand well.   (2) Computer modeling is  creative, students both analyze a situation and design its  solution.   (3) The one-box model is a flexible system, easily  adapted for study of a wide variety of natural phenomena.   (4)  With appropriate software, model building can be carried out by  introductory-level students.   (5) The mathematical description  of a one-box model is well within the grasp of students with  basic calculus skills, and geology majors can gain experience in  applying mathematical techniques to problems of practical  interest.   This exercise is open-ended.   Students begin on a  firm platform of observation and are armed with theory and  computer skills, thus allowing them to explore a range of  problems whose solutions require creative and critical thinking.    This project provides seven new PowerMacintosh computers, two  printers, modeling software, and network hardware.",
