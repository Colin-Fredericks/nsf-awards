 "awd_abstract_narration": "Russell Sage College, founded in 1916,  was commissioned by its founder to prepare women with a solid education in the humanities, arts and sciences.  In adhering to this charge, the Biology Department has continued to make major contributions to science through its recruitment efforts and undergraduate preparation of women scientists. The department's success, however, is in jeopardy due to inadequate facilities in Science Hall, a 30 year old structure that has never been renovated.  The building is not conducive for research and research training activities, currently being pursed in the areas of  environmental studies, genetics, cell biology and physiology.  Space originally designed for non-research purposes have been converted to research space. With NSF support, the College will reorganize research space in a centralized area to alleviate problems associated with the dual usage of space. Renovations will primarily consist of: providing dedicated spaces for two research laboratories, a herbarium, an instrumentation  room, and a prep area for chemical and glassware processing.  Consolidation of research activities in dedicated laboratories will  provide more efficient space for faculty and student researchers, and adequate space for instrumentation, assuring research spaces are made fully accessible to physically challenged persons.   Once completed, the renovated science facility will not only provide modern research and research training space for seven faculty members and students, but will invigorate the department in the historic and important mission of Russell Sage College in the changed environment of a new century.",
