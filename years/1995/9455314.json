 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455314  Walker  Lecture room demonstration experiments, which actually show how  things work, are relatively new to computer science educators. In  most other fields of science, demonstrations have proven quite  effective in combination with a variety of teaching methods and  have been successfully used for many years. Such \"live\"  demonstrations, especially for introductory classes, awaken a keen  interest in the \"chalk and talk\" lecture and tend to be remembered  long afterward. We believe that lecture room demonstrations need to  be considered seriously as a teaching aid for helping to revitalize  introductory computer science courses. The real problem is that  very few instructional materials are currently available on this  subject.  This project addresses the need to develop computer  science lecture room demonstration materials. More specifically, it  concentrates on development of eight innovative, low cost,  computer-hardware-related lecture room demonstration experiments to  improve the computer literacy course taken by non-computer science  majors. These demonstrations help students to better understand  basic concepts of how computers operate and permits them to see  firsthand, a number of attention-grabbing, real-world applications.  Students learn that computers are used for more than just running  software applications. The demonstrations  show students how  computer and peripherals work; illustrate aspects of  telecommunications and networking; show actual business and  industrial applications; and present emerging computer related  technologies such as multimedia, hypermedia and virtual reality.  Details of how to build and set up the demonstration apparatus,  teaching techniques, and results from classroom trials are made  readily available via pamphlets, presentation at workshops, and the  Internet.  This project is expected to be of great interest and  benefit to all teachers of the computer literacy course.",
