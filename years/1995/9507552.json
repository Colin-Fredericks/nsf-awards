 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences are central to biology from both  the basic and the methodological perspectives. As the key  elements in the cellular translation process they are subjects of  detailed structure/function studies in their own right. In  addition, their evolutionary characteristics make them extremely  useful as tools in other areas, microbiology in particular.  Comparative analysis of rRNA sequences has (i) provided the  secondary structure of the rRNAs; (ii) led to the inference of  the universal tree of life--a basis for a natural microbial  classification--and the discovery of the Archaea, (iii) provided  the basis for new and powerful approaches to microbial ecology;  (iv) defined targets for much of the organism-specific probe  development in medical diagnosis; and (v) provided new methods  for environmental impact and bioremediation assessment. Such  studies require large amounts of the rRNA data, and these can be  used effectively only in the context of the appropriate database  of rRNA sequences and related data. It is not sufficient to  provide just the raw sequence data; many analyses require that  the data be organized into alignments, that there be a  phylogenetic overview, and that tools and (for many users) ser  vices be available for data handling and analysis.    In that an rRNA sequence database this useful, this versatile,  did not exist, the Ribosome Database Project (RDP) has been  established at the University of Illinois with support from the  NSF. Through its E-mail (server@rdp.life.uiuc.edu), ftp  (rdp.life.uiuc.edu), gopher (rdpgopher.life.uiuc.edu) and World  Wide Web (http://rdpwww.life.uiuc.edu/index.html) servers, the  RDP offers aligned and phylogenetically ordered rRNA sequences in  a variety of user-selectable formats, as well as various software  for handling and analysis of the data. In addition, services  including automated sequence alignment, organism-specific (or  group-specific) probe design checking, retrieval of  user-selectable subsets of t he sequence data and phylogenetic  trees, and rRNA secondary structure diagrams are provided.    The RDP currently maintains its data in files with formats that  are appropriate for the tools used by the RDP and by the  researchers served. As the volume of data increases, the need for  a more robust and structured system is clear. A properly designed  and implemented version of the RDP on a database management  system (DBMS) will: (i) ensure smooth growth of the RDP; (ii)  provide a uniform and efficient interface to the RDP data for  data accumulation, curation and querying; and (iii) facilitate  the addition of new modes of access to the RDP data and services.  The increased structuring of the data is being carried out with  an eye toward linkage of the RDP's resources with other available  data, facilitating the creation of a federated database. In  addition to increasing the value of the RDP (and the data that  will be linked to it), the proposed work will explore methods for  efficient storage and retrieval of aligned sequence data (the  largest component of the RDP), and for performing the kinds of  complex queries that are used in curating and exploiting these  data.    Specific objectives of this proposal are: (i) complete a detailed  design and implementation of a DBMSbased version of the RDP; (ii)  provide the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) necessary for the  efficient curation of the data; (iii) use the increased data  structuring to further automate the RDP's data updating and  management procedures; (iv) provide all existing user access  modes through the DBMS implementation (v) improve and expand the  access modes and query capabilities available to users of the  RDP; and (v provide the necessary \"hooks\" for integration of the  RDP with other data, initially the federation of microbial  databases being proposed by the Center for Microbial Ecology  (CME) at Michigan State University (MSU).    Given the present volume of rRNA sequence data l approximately  3500 sequences) and the e stimated future level (tens of thousands  of sequences, or more), the RDP has essential roles to play in  biological, medical and environmental research in the future. To  fill these roles, it is necessary to update its design without  interfering with current services. This proposal addresses this  need.",
