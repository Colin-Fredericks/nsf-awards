The directors of the  Biotechnology Center at Northwestern University will collaborate  with the Executive Officer at Palomar College, a two year college  in San Marcos, California and with Providence St. Mel, an inner  city high school in Chicago.  The workshop, will be held July 6-7,  1995, at Northwestern University's Evanston Campus, is designed to  provide a blueprint for the incorporation of ethics in the  teaching, practice and management of biotechnology.  The  information will be used to add to the biotechnology curricula for  technician education and to encourage joint efforts by secondary  schools, two-year colleges, four-year colleges and universities,  and industry.  In addition, it will provide a mechanism to develop  creative ways for this information to be taught, practiced, and  managed in their respective institutions.",
