 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418678  Fleming     One mutation in Drosophila melanogaster which exhibits neuronal  hyperplasia with concomitant reduction in hypodermal structures has  been named Notch. Serrate, another gene mutation, appears to play  an important developmental role in interacting with the Notch gene  product to mediate cell- to- cell signaling during the development  of tissues other than the early embryonic neuroblast, where the  product of another gene, Delta, seems to interact with Notch. Since  Ser-null alleles cause larval death, it has not been possible to  identify which tissues require Ser for viability or the possible  role of Ser post-embryonically. New approaches will be utilized to  answer the questions: (1.) What is the essential role played by  Serrate during development?  (2.) Where and when is the Serrate  protein expressed during development? (3.) What is the nature of  the class of dominant Serrate mutations that interact strongly with  null Delta alleles?  %%%  Experiments are proposed to investigate the function of the Serrate  gene product in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. A number of  genetic loci have been isolated on the basis of a common mutant  phenotype and studies have suggested that most of these genes  products are interactive in a manner necessary for the  differentiation of neuro-ectoderm. The function of one of them,  Serrate, will be examined in relation to its function in embryonic  development and in the manner in which it interacts with products  of other related gene loci.  ***",
