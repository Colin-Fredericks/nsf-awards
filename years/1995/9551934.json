 "awd_abstract_narration": "The diversity of communication applications and the spectrum of  system-level technologies upon which they rely provide a rich set  of opportunities to develop projects allowing students to apply  and integrate knowledge obtained from courses across the  curriculum while simultaneously developing the spectrum of CAD,  prototyping, and testing experiences critical to the engineering  workplace.   Through this project, a Communication System  Prototyping Laboratory (CSPL) provides a curriculum-wide  laboratory resource for integration of junior- and senior-level  required and elective topics through multidisciplinary  communication-based design experiences.   The CSPL organization  emulates the application-driven interdisciplinary environment of  a corporate research and development laboratory through use of  multiple \"microlabs\" within a single instructional lab linked by  a prototype fiber optic backbone.   As the foundation of the CSPL  organization, the Lightwave Microlab supports student design  activities based on lightwave communication applications with a  Prototype Fiber Network; a Photonic Prototyping Center for  student optoelectronic interfacing and optical prototyping; a  Lightwave Test Measurement Center for component, transmission  medium, and system-level evaluation; and a Photonic Reference  Library.   With basic infrastructure for other microlabs in  place, this project specifically addresses the instrumentation  needs of the Lightwave Microlab.",
