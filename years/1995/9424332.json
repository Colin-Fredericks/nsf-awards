 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424332  Fox   The Northeast Parallel Architectures Center (NPAC) at Syracuse University will offer a summer REU site program for 12 undergraduate participants each year for 3 years.  The program will offer research in High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) and will involve faculty from NPAC, the College of Engineering and Computer Science, the Department of Physics, and the Newhouse School of Public Communications.  This program will be a continuation of the successful REU program at NPAC over the past four years.    Research stipends will be awarded to talented and motivated undergraduate students entering their junior and senior years.  At least 8 of the 12 REU participants will be selected from external applicants attending other colleges and universities.  Women, minorities, and disabled students are especially encouraged to apply.  The program will last 10 weeks each summer.    The focus of the research topics will be high performance computing and communication applications in physics and media communications.  Faculty will supervise projects in such topics as parallel computing languages, software and algorithms, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, optimization problems, computer graphics and virtual reality, parallel databases, natural language processing, high-speed networking and ATM technologies, development and application of multimedia technologies such as video-on- demand and the World Wide Web, and the use of HPCC for education.  ***",
