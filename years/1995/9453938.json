 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453938  Schatz    Three rural school districts Riverview, Skykomish and Snoqualmie  Valley in conjunction with the Pacific Science Center will  cooperatively change how science is taught at the elementary level  in the schools.  The project will prepare each district to develop  a new vision for elementary science curriculum establish mechanisms  to implement and sustain the vision provide staff development to  all elementary teachers as a beginning to implement the vision.    Through extensive staff development 30 teachers, called STAFF  leaders, together with 10 administrators will become leaders in  their districts.  These STAFF leaders with the involvement of the  entire teaching staff and the community, utilizing the best in  quality science education will develop comprehensive K-5 curricula  that reflects current research and national standards.  The leaders  will provide 40 hours of science education staff development to  each district's entire elementary teaching staff, a total of 193  teachers.  This 40 hours provides just the beginning, as districts  have committed to developing ongoing support for both staff  development and materials management.  The goal is to provide all  teachers with a minimum 153 hours of professional development.   Principals and administrators will receive 121 hours and parents 32  hours.    The request is for $669,100 of NSF support with cost share  estimated at $1,004,576.",
