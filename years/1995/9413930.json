 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor William A. Goddard at the Beckman Institute of the California   Institute of Technology is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to perform research involving theory and   simulation on problems relevant to new catalysts and chemical processes.   The goal of the research is to determine a set of general concepts and   principles  which will form the basis of mechanistic understandings.   These understandings would make it possible to predict some of the   properties of new systems without measurements or calculations. The   strategy to achieve this goal is to make  use of ab initio quantum   mechanical, QM, results combined with molecular dynamics, MD, studies of   reaction kinetics. The need to perform these QM and MD calculations on   realistic models of systems of practical industrial interest is given   high priority. The  work is divided into method development and the   application of QM and MD to specific catalytic problems of industrial   importance.  There is enormous opportunity for theory and simulation to aid in   designing, developing, and engineering the catalysts and chemical   processes important to industry and society. With reliable simulations to   reduce the number of experiments, U.S. industry could save many millions   of dollars per year and could cut years off development cycles by   focusing on the most promising catalysts and processes. To help provide   the scientific basis for designing, characterizing, and optimizing new   catalysts, the supported research involves a broad attack on the   mechanisms of several industrially significant catalytic processes. This   theoretical work involves collaborations with industrial and university   experimentalists. From detailed studies which combine ab initio quantum   theory and molecular dynamics simulations, it is expected that the   concepts and principles needed to design new types of catalysts will be   extracted. These studies will demand size and time scales which stretch   current methodologies and, hence, considerable emphasis is placed on   developing new methods.",
