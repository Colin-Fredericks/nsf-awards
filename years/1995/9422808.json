 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze some of the  difficulties encountered in the transition from a planned to  market economy.  The first issue to be analyzed is what happens  to firm specific knowledge or organizational capital as state run  firms are replaced by private ones.  A growth model of industry  evolution and transition is developed and used with panel data on  the patterns of birth, growth, and death of manufacturing plants  to estimate the scale of investment in organizational capital.  Another issue to be analyzed is the initial and usually  significant drop in total output that occurs in converting to a  market system.  This drop in output is modeled as arising from  the changes in managers' and workers' incentives that arise as  their rents are redistributed as a result of economic reform.   Finally, the potential role that changes in energy prices might  play in explaining the transition path of the former socialist  economies is analyzed.  A model of production is developed to  assess the impact of energy price changes on energy use, total  output, productivity, investment, and employment.  ***",
