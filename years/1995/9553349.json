 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553349  Salamo  Research in optics at Arkansas is at a crossroads.  We have been  successful at competing on the frontiers of optics and are now  poised to develop actual optical devices and corresponding ties  with industry.  While our laboratory curiosity has led to many  demonstrated device concepts, the materials we use in our studies  are too big and bulky to attract interest by optoelectronic  industries.  They tend to be millimeter in size and are not  integrable into today's submicron electronic structures.  The  objective of this proposal is to make it feasible for us to  develop photorefractive nanostructure materials and bring our  expertise to the submicron world of optoelectrics.  This will be  accomplished by:          (i)   Adding a new faculty member to the Arkansas optics          program with experience in nanostructure fabrication;           (ii)  Adding molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) capability to our          program;           (iii)  Forming a collaboration with a strong and successful          MBE effort with Professor Gary Wicks at the University of          Rochester;           (iv) Focusing our proven expertise in optics and micro-          electronics on opto-electronics.           (v)  Developing ties with industry beginning with an          Advisory Board.    With MBE capability, we can control our own destiny.  Our ability  to open doors for collaboration with industry will be exceedingly  high.  Our ability to produce students with research experience  on the frontiers of our science would rise to new levels.  Our  ability to compete for federal support and to produce science  that will be noticed around the world will escalate.     Furthermore, our capability will be unique.  At the present time  there is no MBE capability in the state of Arkansas or in our  geographic region.  This proposed venture might even mark the  first time anywhere that both MBE and photorefractive science  capability will be under the same direction.",
