 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, is focussed on electrochemical and  photoelectrochemical processes at semiconductors.  During the  tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Bard and his  students at the University of Texas at Austin will pursue a broad  experimental program having four primary thrusts: (1)  investigations od semiconductor/liquid interfaces using scanning  probe microscopies; (2) studies of semiconductor nanoparticles,  known as \"Q-particles,\" and thin films of Q-particles on conducting  substrates; (3) the identification and evaluation of new materials  and the modification of titanium dioxide as more efficient  photocatalysts; and (4) fundamental investigations of mechanisms of  electrode processes at insulators modeled by conducting electrodes  covered with insulating thin films.  This research, which builds  upon results obtained under the aegis of NSF grant CHE-9119851,  seeks to provide a better understanding of the semiconductor/liquid  interface and to improve the efficiency of technologically  important semiconductor photoprocesses.    Photoelectrochemistry at semiconductor surfaces is vital to the  effective utilization of solar energy in applications such as the  production of useful chemicals or the destruction of chemical  wastes.  This research is aimed at improving our understanding of  both dark and photoprocesses at semiconductor/liquid interfaces and  the utilization of that knowledge in the improved design of  technoloeically important photoelectrochemical systems and devices.",
