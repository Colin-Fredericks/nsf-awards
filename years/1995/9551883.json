These experiments will bolster  the instruction of concepts in mechanics, electrostatics, and  thermodynamics by allowing students to relate classroom formalism  directly to laboratory observations.  In developing the  experiments, which will be done by students enrolled in an advanced  design laboratory at the University of Kansas, an emphasis will be  placed on the pedagogy offered by the measurements.  The unique  situation, which has the nation's foremost Native American college  located next to a major research university, will be utilized by  initially introducing the experiments that are developed at Kansas  in the Haskell setting, where the class sizes are small and  individualized instruction is possible.  After the experimental  procedures are optimized at Haskell, the experiments will then be  incorporated into the Kansas sequence.  In addition to  strengthening the courses at both institutions, this partnership  should help Haskell students who wish to transfer to other  institutions through a better coordination of their syllabus with  that at Kansas.  At present, Haskell is unable to offer a  baccalaureate degree in the sciences.  Greater cultural diversity  in the sciences will be achieved at Kansas by attracting interested  students from the Haskell program.",
