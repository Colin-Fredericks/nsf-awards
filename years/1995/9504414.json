In contrast with traditional approaches,  the methods do not assume any restrictive form, and are flexible  enough to detect fine structures.  This project covers a wide  array of statistics methodological developments and foundational  research.  The new developments enhance the availability of   statistical tools, and can lead to significant improvements on  existing methods for extracting information from  noisy data. Specific objectives are  develop new statistical methodologies  and investigate their foundational properties for flexible statistical modeling  in processing high-dimensional data, nonparametric confidence intervals,  mode detection and signal processing.    Many scientific disciplines depend in some way on extracting structural  information from noisy data.  Fields ranging from processing noisy images  and evaluating business marketing, to analyzing survival data and   forecasting economic climates, which are universes apart in their backgrounds,  nevertheless have the common  problem  of drawing conclusions via processing noisy signals.  Such problems may be abstracted as a statistical function estimation   problem and can be analyzed by various techniques in this project.  The objective of this research is to develop and  evaluate flexible statistical modeling techniques.  These techniques  can be applied in the Federal Strategic Areas such as monitoring  environmental and global changes via processing massive collected data  where informative structures can hardly be detected by traditional approache s,   and building statistical modeling for economic and business activities  in the civil infrastructure. The investigators will take advantage of modern  computing facilities, and use statistical knowledge to avoid  unnecessary data mining and hence reduce significantly data processing time.  Thus, the knowledge gained in this study will also be useful   in high performance computing of a federal strategic area.",
