 "awd_abstract_narration": "This addresses curricular needs by designing experiments to use  computer-controlled spectrophotometric instrumentation in the  undergraduate laboratory at all levels, for both majors and  nonmajors.   This enables students to receive the desired  exposure to these methods through hands-on use.  Two different  types of spectrometer are being used.   Fourier transform  infrared (FT-IR) instruments are being used heavily in organic  chemistry and to a lesser extent in analytical chemistry courses.    The second type is a modernized emission spectrophotometer based  on an existing spectrophotofluorimeter.   This is being used for  emission measurements in the ultraviolet and visible regions of  the spectrum.   This spectrometer also serves as a detector in a  Raman spectroscopy experiment.   The fluorescence spectrometer is  being used mostly in general, physical, and analytical chemistry  laboratories.   Both types of spectrometer allow ready spectral  subtraction and database searching and bring the advantages of  signal averaging and easy manipulation of spectra.   The  fluorescence data system also allows the determination of kinetic  parameters from time-varying data Both types of instrument are  being integrated into the laboratory courses serving chemistry  and chemical engineering majors at all levels from general  chemistry to senior research.",
