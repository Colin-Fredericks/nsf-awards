Such data can be viewed as the realization of a spatio-temporal  process with a very complicated distributional structure.  Models in  current use are grossly simplified for both mathematical and computational  expediency.  The statistical challenges in constructing more realistic  models are difficult and manifold.  Many revolve around understanding the  nature of the noise in the measurements and its effect on successfully  detecting regions of neural activation.  Noise in the data shows  significant spatial and temporal correlations that depend strongly on how  the data are collected.  Outliers are common, and there are strong sources  of systematic variation such as the subject's respiratory and cardiac  cycles.  Variances in the images depend nonlinearly on the means, and the  observed absolute levels of activation tend to shift between sessions  because of subject movement.  Moreover, all of these difficulties occur for  data collected from a single subject; the situation becomes much more  complicated if comparisons across subjects are attempted.  This research  focusses on three general problems in the statistical analysis of fMRI  data: 1. The characterization of the response to an activating stimulus in  the fMRI signal and the use of this information to build more realistic  models and make more precise inferences; 2. The development of robust  procedures for identifying active regions that account for the complexity  of the underlying spatio-temporal process; and 3. The construction of  functional maps within a specified system of the brain (e.g., the visual  system) and the use these maps for making predictiv e inference across  subjects.    Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an exciting new technique  that uses advanced technology to obtain images of the active human brain.  The technique is of particular interest to cognitive neuropsychologists  because of the unique perspective it offers into high-level cognitive  processing in humans: areas of the brain that are activated by a stimulus  or cognitive task ``light up'' in an fMRI image.  This technology will thus  play a critical role in understanding how the brain works; however, before  this potential can be realized, significant statistical challenges in the  interpretation and analysis of fMRI data must be overcome.  For example,  there is substantial uncertainty in the identification of neural activity  from these images and in the attribution of that activity to particular  cognitive processes.  Moreover, there is a need for new methods of making  statistical inferences of scientific interest from these large and complex  sets of data.  This research focusses on three broad aspects of the general  problem: 1. Constructing models for the systematic components of the  process that generates the data, 2. Studying and modeling the properties of  the noise in the measurements so that analysis and inference can be made  more precise, and 3. Developing new methods of inference for addressing  interesting scientific questions with massive sets of data that arise from  measurements over space and time.",
