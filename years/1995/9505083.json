 "awd_abstract_narration": "95005083  Stahl    This U.S.-Argentina Workshop award supports travel expenses  of  the P.I., Dr. P. Stahl, Washington Univ. , Saint Louis,  MO., five other senior scientists, and three post-doctoral  fellows to the workshop which will be held at the  Universidad de Cuyo, Mendoza, Argentina, in October, 1995.  Travel expenses will also be provided for five South-  American Fellows, from countries that are not covered under  bilateral agreements  with NSF.  Some expendable supplies and services related to  the workshop will also be covered.  The Argentine co-  organizer is Dr. Luis Mayorga of the Universidad de Cuyo,  Mendoza; other Argentinean scientists involved in the  workshop are Drs. Lopez and Sosa, also from the Univ. of  Cuyo, and Dr. Maccioni, from Cordoba University.    Over the past decade significant progress has been made in  the understanding of  the cellular and  molecular basis of  intracellular transport.   Fundamental processes, such as  secretion, endocytosis and mitosis, processes requiring  selective and  specific membrane fusion events, are  increasingly open to study.  Applications of new techniques  to a variety of cellular systems, both in plants and animals  provides unique opportunities to further expand the level of  understanding of vesicular transport.    The workshop  will provide a unique opportunity  to explore  these developments, by gathering  a small group of  scientists from several laboratories from North and South  America to exchange ideas about their work on the cell and  molecular biology of intracellular transport.   The workshop  will substantially enhance and extend a very productive  international collaboration between U.S. and Argentinean  scientists, as well  as scientists from other Latin American countries.  The  workshop will also provide an opportunity to engender  long  term interactions among faculty and students. This is  particularly attractive, since the students will be, for the  most part, in the formative years of their training, and  wi ll be in an optimal position to benefit from potential  international exchange.      ***",
