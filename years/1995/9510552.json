Nine invited lectures will be  delivered  by Professors K. J. Brown from Heriot-Watt University, Scotland,  (Title: Nonlinear boundary value problems involving an indefinite  weight function); Luis Caffarelli from Princeton University,  (Title: Volume and rotation in Lagrangian coordinates); David  Caughey from Cornell University, (Title: Iterative convergence  and  accuracy of numerical solutions of the Euler equations); Jerome  Eisenfeld from University of Texas, (Title: Structural  identification of compartmental models); Jack Hale from Georgia  Tech, (Title: Convergence of Invariant Manifolds); Peter D. Lax  from NYU-Courant (Title: Positive schemes for solving  multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems of conversation laws);  Robert  MacCormack from Stanford University, (Title: Solution of the  Navier-Stokes' equations on block grids for aerodynamic  configurations; John Mallet-Paret from Brown University, (Title:  Dynamics of lattice differential equations) and Helen Yee from  NASA Ames Research Center, (Title: On the fundamental of dynamics  of numerics for CFD).  In addition, about 75 contributed papers  are  expected.  The Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computation, is  devoting a special issue to the publication of the proceedings of  this conference.       This multidisciplinary conference brings together  mathematicians, scientists and engineers from both academia and  industry for the purpose of exchanging research developments in  the theory and application of differential equations and computer  simulations.  Central themes include materials-related phenomena  and computational fluid dynamics, with an emphasis on numerical  methods applicable to practical problems arising in engineering.",
