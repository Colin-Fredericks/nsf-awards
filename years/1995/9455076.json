 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concurrent engineering is a new approach to product development in  which all phases of the design paradigm are considered  simultaneously during the early stages of the design process. The  concurrent engineering paradigm is characterized by a 3-D solid  model data base that can be used directly for engineering analysis,  prototype manufacturing, and production of engineering  documentation. Engineering and technology curricula should be  modified accordingly to answer this modern need for concurrent  engineering design education. Of particular interest in this  project is the infusion of a meaningful concurrent engineering  experience in the lower-division curriculum where students need  motivation and encouragement to continue their studies.    The format of the project consists of two one-week workshops held  during the summer of 1995 at the University of Texas at Austin. The  workshops will be accessible to lower-division faculty from both  four-year schools and two-year colleges. A total of 48 faculty  participants will be accommodated and matched to one of the  workshops based on their background. Topics of the workshop will  include: 1. 3-D solid modeling techniques; 2. application of solid  model data to design analysis such as mass properties and finite  elements; 3. application of the model data to manufacturing  simulation and rapid prototyping; 4. generation of engineering  documentation from the solid model; and 5. curriculum and  laboratory development issues. A highlight of the workshop will be  a short team design project in which a rapid physical prototype is  derived from a solid model of a mechanical part designed by the  team.    The project will prepare the participants to develop local  instructional material and modern CAD/CAM laboratories that will  afford their students a meaningful, early exposure to concurrent  engineering design concepts. In addition, the project will motivate  the participants to become active in making and publishing their  own contributions to eng ineering education.",
