The project will investigate the  characteristics and physical mechanisms of the photoplastic effect  (PPE) in ice:  pure and doped ice demonstrate significant and  persistent hardening under the action of ultraviolet illumination.   The fundamental mechanism of PPE in ice is not understood, and is  of importance from a fundamental solid state physics standpoint as  well as geophysical and environmental viewpoints.  Both laboratory  and field experiments will be conducted.  Emphasis will be placed  in microscopic processes which are studied by internal friction,  dislocation currents, conductivity and photoconductivity, etching  and replicating of dislocations emerging on the surface of the ice,  and spectroscopic study of photochemical products accumulating ice  under illumination.  The project also includes a modest theory  component.  The results are intended to determine the fundamental  mechanism of the PPE in ice, and whether or not ultraviolet solar  irradiation is essential in forming plastic properties of natural  ice and snow.    % % %    This project is co-funded between the Condensed Matter Physics and  Polar Glaciology Programs.
