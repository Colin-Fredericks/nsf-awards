 "awd_abstract_narration": "9507189    Bacteria and other microorganisms are surrounded by  a  thin  molecular  skin or membrane across which they interact  with  the  external environment.  The molecular structure of  this  membrane adapts dynamically to allow the organism to survive  in   the  particular  environment.  Information  about   the  organism's environment is transmitted via components of this  membrane  known  as  lipids.  These  lipids  are  constantly  changing  in  structure  in  response  to  the  environment.  Understanding this capacity for dynamic adaptive change  and  the  nature of the actual changes themselves constitute  the  central  foci of this research. The structural modifications  that  occur  in  the  membrane during  adaptive  change  are  directed  by enzymes that, in addition to functioning  under  extremely  adverse  conditions,  have  activities  that  are  regulated   by   the  actual  conditions  themselves.   This  constitutes an important molecular feed-back phenomenon that  is critical to our understanding of adaptation. The research  will  use  spectroscopic and chromatographic  techniques  to  determine  the changes in fatty acid structure and molecular  cross-linking  that  occur  in  bacterial  membranes  during  adaptation  to extreme conditions.  The ability of  bacteria  to  adapt to extremes of temperature, pressure, acidity  and  the  presence of organic solvents and other chemical species  is   important  because  of  their  potential   utility   as  biocatalysts, bioremediation agents or to fix gases such  as  nitrogen  or  carbon dioxide.  Better understanding  of  the  critical  features  that  determine this  adaptability  will  improve our ability to use it to human advantage.",
