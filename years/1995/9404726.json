 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research focuses on an important, so-far,  unresolved issue of end-to-end modeling, analysis, and  parallel simulation of  Broadband Integrated Service Digital  Network (B-ISDN) architectures.  ATM  (Asynchronous Transfer  Mode) is the multiplexing and switching techniques for  the B-  ISDN architecture.    The end-to-end models to predict performance  measures such  as delay and throughput in order to design an accurate  admission  control protocol for ATM networks are  unsatisfactory.  They are either  computationally too  expensive (And thus impossible to perform on-line in real-  time) or too simplistic and inaccurate. There is  considerable room for  improvement in accuracy, without  prohibitive complexity.  Also the concept of  `Quality  Service` (QoS) has been trivialized in most analytical  results to be  just the cell loss probability.  Consequently,  results, e.g., in call admission  and call policing, are  primarily judged by their effectiveness concerning cell  loss  probability.  The introduction of additional measures (e.g.,  delay and  delay jitter bounds) will further restrict the set  of possible admissible  traffic mixtures, and as a result,  the often-used linear call admission method  (and the related  equivalent bandwidth definition) becomes insufficient.  Hence,  other call admission techniques may very well be  needed.    The effectiveness  of the call admission algorithms can be  investigated while utilizing results  from end-to-end models.  There is a need to exploit the special control features  that  can be provided by an ATM network, such as the allocation of  buffers to  connections in intermediate nodes, or the re-  negotiation of the traffic  descriptor or of the QoS during  the lifetime of a connection.    In this  project an analytical method based on Pade  Approximation is used to analyze the  end-to-end model for  ATM networks. Also a fast parallel simulation approach is  used as a complementary technique.  Note that the methods  can also be used as   general purpose performance evaluation  tools and can be applied to a larger set  of modeling  problems.",
