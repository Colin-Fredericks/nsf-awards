The project will focus on the  specific questions of asymptotic and exponential stability of the balanced  systems and the boundedness properties of the system operators. A further  important point which will be addressed is the issue of whether general  Trotter-Kato type convergence results can be proved for the balanced  approximation scheme.        Many engineering systems, such as highly flexible mechanical systems,  inherently contain infinitely many degrees of freedom and therefore any  accurate mathematical description of such a system must necessarily be  infinite dimensional. This project is concerned with so-called balanced  realizations for infinite dimensional linear systems. One of the important  uses of balanced realizations of linear systems is as a tool in achieving  model reductions of complex systems, which is a very important consideration  at a practical and computational level. There already exists an extensive,  elegant and important (from the point of view of applications) body of results  concerning balanced realizations and their role in model reduction for finite  dimensional systems. However, extensions of existing theory to infinite  dimensional systems is extremely complex at both the conceptual and technical  levels. The aim of this project is to develop the mathematical and  computational tools that are of similar power to those available for systems  of finite complexity.  ***  ??",
