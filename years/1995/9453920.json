 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453920  Hazen    SEEDS is a project intended to spearhead a revolution in the way  that elementary science is being taught in Stark County schools.   A local school-business alliance (TEEP), the Stark County School  District (an educational service agency) and 17 school districts  have joined forces to initiate the project.  The goal for the  project is to develop hands-on, minds-on elementary curriculum that  is integrated with language arts and mathematics.  This will be  accomplished via the mechanism of preparing Lead  Teachers/Leadership Teams of 200 teachers who will receive training  in leadership skills, science content, pedagogy and authentic  assessment.  These teams will subsequently work with all 1150  elementary science teachers in the county.  The process for the  typical teacher will begin with a unique 'immersion' experience in  1995 to be followed over the course of the next five years with  further enhancement, that will be designed with the use of personal  development plans so that each teacher continues to grow  professionally to meet their own personal needs.  These plans will  incorporate a total of 150 hours of enhancement.  The request is for $4,489,226 with cost share estimated at  $3,049,683 (59%).",
