 "awd_abstract_narration": "Juvenile hormone (JH) is critical for insect development and  reproduction.  Although numerous whole-organismal studies of  JH have been carried out, little is understood of the  molecular action of this hormone.  Using a genetic approach,  this PI has been studying how JH acts at the molecular level  in Drosophila melanogaster.  Previous work led to the  isolation of a mutant, Methoprene tolerant (Met), which has  high resistance to JH or to methoprene, a JH insecticidal  analog.  Met flies were shown to have an intracellular JH  binding protein, perhaps a JH receptor, possessing a reduced  affinity for JH III.  There is good evidence that this  change in affinity is responsible for the resistance.  Both  the phenotype of Met resistance and the JH binding data  suggest that the Met+ gene may encode the receptor.  The DNA  region containing the Met+ gene has been cloned, two  transcripts have been identified, and cDNA molecules have  been isolated and 80% sequenced.  The work is now poised for  a molecular developmental study of this gene and its  product.  Met+ cDNAs will be expressed to generate both  fusion and non-fusion Met+ protein. Met+ fusion protein will  be used to raise a polyclonal antibody specific for Met+  protein.  This antibody will be used to identify Met+  protein in biochemical preparations as well as determine its  intracellular localization.  Particular attention will be  given to possible interaction of the antibody with polytene  chromosomes to determine if the Met+ protein interacts with  chromosomes, presumably as a transcription factor.  Authentic Met+ non-fusion protein will be generated for each  of the two Met+ full-length cDNAs following expression in a  baculoviral expression system.  The ability of each of these  proteins to bind JH III and JH bisepoxide will be evaluated.  The hypothesis that Met+ encodes a JH binding protein will  be directly tested in these experiments.  Finally, in work  designed to bridge to future studies of JH action in  Drosophila, novel  methoprene-resistant mutations on the  second and third chromosomes will be isolated following FRT-  FLP screening.  The screen will be designed to identify loci  whose gene product may act independently or may physically  interact with the Met+ protein to confer resistance.  This  work will have significance in several ways:  (1) the  intracellular localization and JH binding of the Met+ gene  product will be evaluated, leading to a better understanding  of JH action; (2) novel loci involved in JH action may be  identified; and (3) since Met mutants are resistant to JH  insecticidal analogs, a better understanding of this  resistance mechanism to these compounds will be gained.  This knowledge may be applicable for resistance management  of pest insects under control with JH insecticidal analogs.",
