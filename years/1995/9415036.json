 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shepherd College, founded in 1871, is part of the West Virginia State College System, that serves approximately 3500 students.  The institution is moving vigorously toward improving the academic performance of its students, and increasing the number of graduates who enter graduate and professional schools.  In commitment to this effort,  and in response to changes in research and in the science and mathematics curriculum,  Shepherd College has begun a major multi-phase renovation project of Synder Hall, the science building, and construction of a new science addition. Research space in Synder Hall, assigned to biology  and chemistry, will be relocated to the new wing. NSF funds, however, will be used to partially support the consolidation and renovation of research and research training spaces dedicated for archeology, geology, environmental science, mathematics, computer sciences and engineering.  Laboratories currently used for faculty investigations and student research projects are located in insufficient areas void of adequate ventilation, and compliance to safety requirements.  Due to the multi-use of laboratory space, research activity is limited for practical and safety reasons.  In order for students to remain competitive, Shepherd College must provide an environment commensurate with the protocols of contemporary research required. By renovating Synder Hall, students and faculty will have new opportunities to meet their research and research training needs and the needs of the modern technology based industries in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.",
