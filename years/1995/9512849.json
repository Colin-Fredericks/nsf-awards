Danyluk,  Department of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of  Technology, to conduct with Dr. Soo Wohn Lee, Department of  Materials Science and Engineering, Sun Moon University,  Choongnam, Korea, a U.S.-Korea Joint Seminar on Tribology.  This  joint seminar will be held in Seoul, Korea, October 24-28, 1995.   The participation of ten U.S. scientists/engineers will be  supported under this award.  The joint seminar will address  several topics of current concern in the field of tribology,  including wear modeling, lubricants, micro/nanotribology, surface  polishing, and subsurface damage generation.  In addition to  formal seminar sessions, the U.S. delegation plans to learn about  and evaluate the status of tribology research conducted in Korea  through discussions on research results at the seminar and  through site visits to evaluate tribology research capabilities  in Korea.  The U.S. participants will return to the U.S. by way  of Japan where they will participate in the International  Tribology Conference, Yokohama, from October 30 to November 2,  1995.  The field of tribology is of great importance in  manufacturing processes and in maintenance of machinery.  The PI  and his Korean collaborator are well qualified to organize and  conduct such a joint seminar, as both are well known scholars in  the related field of research.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which  seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and  Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual interest and benefit.  Korean  participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
