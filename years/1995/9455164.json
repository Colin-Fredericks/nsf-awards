 "awd_abstract_narration": "The MAA is offering a workshop on cooperative learning techniques  for mathematics instructors.  The workshop takes place over two  summers and the intervening academic year, beginning in summer  1995.  Experienced, enthusiastic collegiate-level mathematics  faculty, particularly those from two year colleges, who are  interested in cooperative learning techniques for their own  classrooms are the target audience.  The goals of the workshop are  preparing them to bring cooperative learning into their classrooms  and departments, and to serve as regional resources for local  cooperative learning projects.  The project will also test the  hypothesis that the proposed setting and time frame is an effective  way to aid faculty to develop the skills to enable them to  successfully use cooperative learning as a significant teaching  mode.",
