 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to understand the possible functions of  ultraviolet-(UV) and polarization-vision in animals, it  is necessary to be able to view and measure these  environmental parameters.  Since we  are  functionally  blind  to these aspects of  the photic environment, we  must depend on instrumentation such as  spectroradiometers and cameras for visualization.  It  is also necessary that we understand how these  environmental parameters vary with time as many animals  gain and lose these visual sensitivities with age.    This project will provide two new instruments for the  study of W and polarization vision.  The first is a  photographic camera-based spectroradiometer which will  allow for unattended, long-term monitoring of the solar  spectrum from 300 nm to 700 nm. The second is an  imaging polarimeter based on modifications to a  three-tube colour television camera.  This camera is  already being used for multispectral imaging in the  visible and UV, and the addition of polarization  imaging will greatly enhance its utility.    The information gained using these instruments will  greatly enhance our understanding of why animals have  evolved UV and polarization visual capabilities.  The  imaging polarimeter will also determine the  polarization c haracteristics of relevant visual  targets, such as planktonic prey, for which UV  information is available.",
