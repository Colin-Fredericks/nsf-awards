 "awd_abstract_narration": "9455830  Watts  A curriculum for chemistry at the undergraduate level is being  developed that will better prepare chemistry and biochemistry  majors for employment through a novel Joint Industrial Chemistry  Degree (JICD) which includes a two year work experience graded by  term papers and oral presentations.  Majors will also be afforded  extensive research experience through a new undergraduate degree  graded by thesis with an oral defense.  These changes will allow  the intensive industrial and research degrees to be conducted off-  campus, and facilitate the pathway to a degree by economically  disadvantaged students, by developing a module-based study sequence  at the junior and senior level.  The curriculum also introduces new  technologies through extensive use of computers, and it improves  opportunities for minority groups by using concepts adapted from  our existing Native American, Women in Science and High School  outreach programs.  Concurrent pathways at the freshman and  sophomore level for non-science majors, life science majors  including nursing and pre-meds, and physical sciences majors  including pre-engineering are being developed.  Close collaboration  with the chemical and biochemical industry, other departments  within the University, and Community Colleges and other four year  colleges in the Pacific Northwest is planned.  Program assessment  will be based on methods developed in collaboration with a  management consultant group.  Results will be disseminated by peer-  reviewed publications, monographs presenting upper level modules,  software publication and presentations at national meetings.",
