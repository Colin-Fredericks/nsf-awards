 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321057  Simchon   This SBIR Phase II project addresses a modified, augmented  hydrostatic extrusion process for production of very fine wire.   Such wire is used as bonding wire in microchips.  With the advent of modern micro-electronics, the need for gold and  aluminum wire of fine diameter has continuously increased.  In the  fabrication of very fine wire, severe limits exist on the speed,  reduction per mass, and thinness of the emerging wire.  In the Phase I study of the processes of wire drawing and augmented  hydrostatic extrusion (hydraw) of very fine wire, root causes and  the nature of these limitations were studied, both analytically and  experimentally.  A modified process for Phase II was designed  according to criteria developed in this study.  Wire of 0.5 mil (0.0125 mm) was produced, and experimental quantities of wire were  made on laboratory equipment and tested.     The Phase II goal is a production prototype hydraw unit for 0.5 mil  gold and aluminum wire.  The prototype machine will be used to  study the reliability and quality of the wire product and economic  parameters of the modified hydraw concept.",
