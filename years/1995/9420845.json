 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420845  Kraut  The electron transfer reaction between cytochrome c peroxidase  (CcP) and cytochrome c will be examined.  CcP is a 34,000 M.W.  monomeric heme enzyme that catalyses the reduction of peroxide to  water, using cytochrome c as the electron donor.  One step in the  catalytic cycle of CcP involves rapid electron transfer between the  hemes of CcP and cytochrome c, although the heme edges are  separated by at least 17  .  The crystal structure of CcP and the  complex formed between CcP and cytochrome c have been determined in  this laboratory.  These crystal structures will be used to guide  site-directed mutagenesis experiments aimed at perturbing specific  elements of the electron transfer pathway between the two hemes.   The effect of specific mutations on structure and electron transfer  rates will be evaluated using crystallography and transient  spectroscopy techniques.  The results will help to define the  structural elements that are required for the long distance  electron transfer reaction between the hemes of CcP and cytochrome  c.  %%%  All aerobic organisms obtain the energy required for biosynthetic  reactions from the conversion of oxygen to water.  This is  accomplished by a highly ordered enzyme system that transfers  electrons from metabolites to oxygen, while preserving some of the  energy from this reaction for use in synthetic reactions.  The  cellular electron transfer system consists of a variety of metal  centers that are embedded in proteins.  It is clear that the  electrons are transferred between the metal centers, and the  electron transfer is controlled by the protein surrounding the  metal centers, but little is known about how the protein matrix  makes these electron transfer reactions efficient and highly  specific.  As a first step in understanding this process, this  investigation will examine how electron transfer is conducted  rapidly between the metal centers of twm well-defined protein  molecules.  The larger goal of the work is to understand how   aerobic organisms achieve the efficient and specific electron  transfer reactions that are required for survival.  ***",
