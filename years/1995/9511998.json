 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study is an experimental investigation of jaw movement:  how jaw movement changes as a function of whether the speaker  emphasizes a word when s/he is asked to clarify a word a listener  misunderstood, and also, how jaw movement changes when the  speaker must repeat this same word several times in order to make  himself understood by the listener. The method involves examining  jaw movement tracings from x-ray microbeam recordings, which have  already been collected for four speakers. These jaw movement  traces will be measured in terms of various duration, velocity  and displacement measures using a recently developed software  tool. Tentative statistical analyses will be applied to these  measurements to plan for future research which would involve a  large number of subject in order to identify which jaw measures  are most useful in characterizing contrastive emphasis. Although  previous studies have examined jaw movement associated with  contrastive emphasis, no study to date has looked at jaw movement  of unrehearsed impromptu speech, and especially not of speakers  saying the same utterance with repeated corrections.       As an experimental study, it is independent of any  particular theoretical framework; however, one of the goals of  this endeavor is to better understand the underlying  organizational principles of speech considering existing  theoretical models. In particular, jaw movement pattern in a  seminatural dialogue situation will be interpreted as an aspect  of the prosodic representation of the utterance, relating  observed articulatory gestures to perceived of emphasis placed on  one of the three digits in a sequence, in the context, like, \"No,  it is nine FIVE nine Pine Street\" (the capitalized digit  indicates the word the speaker emphasized). The findings of this  study are proposed to be interpreted to examine the validity of  several current theories of articulation-based prosodic  organization models; in particular, the PI's recent theory of  phonetic implemen tation (the converter-distributor model) will be  evaluated determining its system parameters such as the relation  between the numerically augmented metrical pattern and magnitudes  of syllables and boundaries.",
