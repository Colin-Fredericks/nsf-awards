 "awd_abstract_narration": "NCR-9502725  David B. Johnson      The availability of powerful mobile computing devices and wireless  networking products and services is increasing dramatically, making  it natural for users to expect to be able to access network  resources and to utilize the growing global internetwork at any  time and from any where. However, existing internetworking  protocols such as IP, ISO CLNP, NetWare IPX, and AppleTalk cannot  currently support this type of host mobility. Network applications  generally must be reconfigured and restarted when connecting to the  network at a different point, making host movement difficult, time  consuming, and error prone.    The objective of this research is to develop scalable and robust  protocols for providing  seamless support of transparent  internetworking for wireless and mobile hosts.  This research  addresses a number of areas in which new support is needed for this  goal, including internetwork routing to mobile hosts; routing among  mobile hosts in an ad hoc wireless network; internetwork  multicasting to and from mobile hosts; and protocol support to  allow higher-layer protocols and applications to adapt their  behavior in response to mobility.  The work in this project will  consist of designing new protocols, implementing each protocol, and  evaluating each protocol using performance measurement and  simulation studies over a range of environments and alternative  design choices.",
