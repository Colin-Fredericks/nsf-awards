 "awd_abstract_narration": "The traditional introductory algebra-based physics course at the  university suffers from two major weaknesses: lack of proper  connection between lecture and laboratory and the poor math  preparation of the students.   The first problem is being  attacked by combining lecture and lab into a single 2-hour  session, three times a week.   The second problem is aggravated  by the fact that the traditional course begins with mechanics,  for which the requisite math includes vectors, limits,  derivatives, and integrals.   This problem of math preparation is  being combatted by reordering the syllabus, putting optics and  waves before mechanics in the fall semester.   A number of our  traditional lab exercises are being updated, and new labs in  fiber-optic coupling, the optics of rainbows, and voice  transmission are being added in order to make this new beginning  much more exciting for the students.",
