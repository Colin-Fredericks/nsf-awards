 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer-automated data acquisition and automated experimental  control have revolutionized physics and engineering laboratory  methods over the past two decades.    The widespread use of the  technology and the recent development of powerful, user-friendly  software packages justifies and enables the effective teaching of  these techniques at the sophomore/junior level.   This project  implements a curriculum that combines the teaching of simple  computer automation techniques with conventional intermediate  level courses in electronics and modern physics.   A sound  pedagogical marriage can be achieved, so that the students  gradually learn about the \"tool\" that the computer represents,  while making increasingly sophisticated use of that tool to learn  about experimental physics.   Students learn about the tool in a  structured and pedagogically sound manner that encourages  interactive learning and confronts the student with a series of  questions of increasing complexity.   The gradually acquired  skills are used to increase the efficiency of data collection in  the modern physics and electronics laboratory, and this allows  the students to spend more time focused on the meaning of the  results.   The acquired skills help students to participate in  meaningful, career-building internships in the middle of their  undergraduate years and to become effective undergraduate  researchers as they near graduation.   The project is being  implemented primarily with LabVIEW software, and with electronic  meters and sources interfaced through IEEE-488 based hardware.",
