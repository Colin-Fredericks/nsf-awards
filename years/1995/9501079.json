The organizers are Dr. Firdaus Udwadia  of the University of Southern California, Dr. Miklos Farkos of  the Technical University of Budapest, and Dr. Arkadii  Kryazhimskii, representing IIASA.    Researchers attending this workshop will deliver presentations  and discuss topics concerning the use of advanced methods in:  1) analytical dynamics and control, and 2) control of nonlinear  uncertain systems.  Their overall objective is to derive improved  mathematical models with more realistic predictions and determine  methods for engineering control actions that can be more robust  under uncertainties.  It is anticipated that this effort to bring  together scientists, engineers, and industrial technology experts  from the U.S. and Europe will yield ideas for longer-term  research projects that may lead to increased precision in  mathematical modeling of relevant phenomena so that newer models  can be made more realistic and more readily applicable to areas  such as environmental and biomechanical systems, where  uncertainties predominate.  ***",
