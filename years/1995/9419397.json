 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Professor Mostafa El-Sayed of the Georgia Institute of   Technology will pursue a series of investigations in transition state   spectroscopy.  Specifically, the internal vibrational energy   redistribution (IVR) in photodissociating molecules will be studied in   real time using a pump-probe method.  Two femtosecond lasers are to be   used, one to cause photodissociation and the other, suitably time delayed   with respect to the first, to resonantly ionize one of the photofragments   whose recoil velocity distribution is determined as function of the   pump-probe time delay.  The spatial distribution of the recoil velocities   of the photofragments will also be determined.  This distribution depends   on the internal energy distribution over the various degrees of freedom   of the parent and photofragment species.   The experiments will be done   with unsaturated organic and metal iodide molecules.  One of the current problem areas in chemistry is the nature of the   transition state.  Inherent in the field of chemistry is the simple idea   that during a chemical reaction the reactants are converted to products   by breaking reactant bonds and forming new bonds.  During the reaction   new species are formed which are neither reactants nor products.  These   species are transient species and, due to their role in the transition   from reactants to products, are said to occur in the `transition region`,   and their specific nuclear configurations are termed `transition states`.    One of the most important issues in chemical reaction dynamics is to   elucidate the relation between the properties of the transition state and   the characteristics of the reaction product. The duration, or life time,   of a transition state, and thus the duration of a chemical reaction   rocess, varies from one trillionth of one second (one picosecond) to one   housandth of a trillionth of one second (one quadrillionth, or one   femtosecond).  Direct, detailed molecular level information about the   transition state of molecular systems can only be obtained with   sophisticated techniques that employ lasers with ultra short pulse   duration (femtosecond lasers).  The research proposed by Professor   El-Sayed uses novel laser techniques to obtain needed data for the   understanding of the transition state in chemical reactions.",
