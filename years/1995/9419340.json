 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mason  9419340  The forrnation of peptide bonds in the peptidyl transferase center  (PTC) of the large nbosomal subunit is the primary catalytic  activity of all ribosomes. An important objective in the field of  ribosome research is to understand the structure and catalytic  mechanism of the PTC. The sequence and structure of the large  subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) in the PTC are very highly  conserved in nature, and there is abundant evidence supporting the  possibility that rRNA acts as a ribozyme in catalyzing the PT  reaction. Current thinking favors a structural role for the  r proteins in maintaining the conformation of active sites in the  rRNA, although a catalytic role for r proteins has not been ruled  out completely. Using the yeast mitochondrial ribosome as an  experimental system, the current project has focused on the  molecular genetic analysis of mitochondrial homologues of four  bacterial PTC proteins (L2, L3, L16 and L27) and an rRNA ribose  methyltransferase (Pet56p) that catalyzes the formation of  2' O methylguanosine at a universally conserved G nucleotide in the  PTC of LSU rRNAs. The importance of modified nucleotides in rRNA is  suggested by models of the E. coli ribosome in which the majority  of the approximately 24 modified nucleotides are clustered around  the mE~NA tRNA peptide complex in the functional center of the  ribosome. Three of the modifications in the 23S rRNA of E. coli are  ribose methylations at highly conserved nucleotides in the PTC of  domain V. The retention of three modified nucleotides in the  otherwise minimally modified mitochondrial LSU rRNA points to a  fundamental role for these particular modifications in ribosome  assembly or function or both. Indeed, pet56 mutants fail to  assemble 54S ribosomal subunits. A largely molecular genetic  approach will be used to study the functional requirement for  Gm2251 in yeast mitochondrial ribosomes. A strategy based on  functional complementation of E. coli mutants by yeast PET56 will  be used to i dentify the gene for the bacterial homologue of Pet56p.  These studies will provide new information about the structure,  function and assembly ofthe principal catalytic center ofthe  ribosome.     %%%   Linking amino acids through peptide bonds is the fundamental  reaction of biological protein synthesis. This reaction takes place  in the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the large ribosomal  subunit and is thought to occur by the same catalytic mechanism in  all cells. An important objective is to understand the respective  roles ofthe ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins in the  structure and catalytic activity of the PTC. Current thinking  favors a structural role for the ribosomal proteins in maintaining  the catalytic active sites in the rRNA, but there is only a  rudimentary understanding of the underlying molecular architecture.  There is a functional requirement for nucleotide modification in  the PTC. Recent results have shown that the addition of a methyl  (CH3) group to the sugar of a specific G nucleotide is an essential  step in the formation of the PTC in yeast mitochondrial ribosomes.  This G nucleotide is conserved in all ofthe known LSU rRNAs. The  well studied E. coli ribosome contains ca. 24 modified nucleotides,  all clustered around the the functional center of the ribosome. In  contrast, the yeast mitochondrial ribosome has only three modified  nucleotides, each identical to one of the modifications in the PTC  of E. coli LSU rRNA. The presence of only three modified  nucleotides in a functional LSU rRNA underscores the potential  importance of these particular modifications. The major objective  of this research is to understand why the addition of a single  methyl group is so crucial in a huge macromolecular complex  containing a >3,000 nucleotide long rRNA and approximately 40  ibosomal proteins. Overall, these studies will provide new  information about the principal catalytic center ofthe ribosome.  ***",
