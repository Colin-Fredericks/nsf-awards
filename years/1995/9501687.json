 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research Program.  This study examines the intersection among state policies, type of economy, and the family in affecting occupational sex segregation.  Theoretical issues relate to gender stratification and the effects of institutional arrangments.  Data are from national censuses between 1960 and  1990 in the United States, Sweden, Japan, and Hungary.  The four countries have been selected because they are expected to display four distinct patterns of sex segregation.    %%%   This research will contribute to sociological understanding of how state policies affect the segregation of occupations according to the sex of workers as well as the ways in which women deal with competing obligations from work and family.  The results should be useful to policy makers concerned with equal opportunity for women and support for the family.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the national and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
