 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vast majority of mRNAs in meiotic and haploid  spermatogenic cells in mice exhibit high levels of  translationally repressed free messenger ribonucleoprotein  particles (mRNPs).  Some mRNAs, such as protamine mRNAs, are  stored as free-mRNPs in early haploid cells and recruited  onto polysomes at specific times in late haploid cells.  The  proportions of other mRNAs in repressed free-mRNPs in  meiotic and early haploid cells range from virtually all to  none.  Thus, translation of nearly every individual mRNA in  meiotic and haploid spermatogenic cells is regulated by mRNA-  specific controls specifying the stage of translational  repression and/or the proportion of free-mRNPs.  Very little  is known about the mRNP proteins in spermatogenic cells,  even though these proteins are likely to determine the  translational competence of spermatogenic mRNAs.  The  overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the  structure and translational competence of free-mRNP and  polysomal mRNP particles in meiotic and haploid cells in  mice.  The experiments are designed to characterize the  abundant mRNP proteins, specifically those mRNP proteins  that are complexed with large numbers of different mRNAs.  These mRNP proteins are predicted to consist of two well-  characterized proteins, the poly(A) binding proteins and Y-  box proteins, and a set of unidentified proteins.  There is  growing evidence that Y-box proteins function as non-  specific translational repressors by packaging many mRNAs in  a wide variety of eukaryotic cells into free-mRNPs.  It  follows that the structure and translational properties of  free-mRNPs may be determined primarily by Y-box proteins.  The basic premise of this proposal is that elucidation of  the general structure of free-mRNPs will be crucial for  understanding translational control of individual mRNAs.  A  major objective of this proposal is to characterize the  levels of various mRNP proteins in the cytosolic, polysomal  and free-mRNP fractions in several stages  of spermatogenic  cells that exhibit high levels of translationally repressed  free-mRNPs.  The translational competence of native free-  mRNPs and polysomal mRNPs will be compared in the  reticulocyte and wheat germ cell-free translation system.  This proposal is intended to introduce talented  undergraduates to research in molecular biology.",
