 "awd_abstract_narration": "9416749  Zimmer-Faust         The process of recruitment of pelagic larvae into  benthic habitats has been given serious attention in  biological oceanography because of its role as a  \"bottleneck\" in the population dynamics of marine organisms.  In the field of larval ecology, emphasis has been given to :  1) the hydrodynamics of larval delivery to the substratum,  2) the physiological and nutritional condition of larvae,  which provides information on survivorship in the field, and  3) chemical cues for larvae that dictate attachment sites in  the benthic environment.       Dr. Zimmer-Faust has found evidence that larvae of a  commercially important species, the American Oyster, respond  to a chemical in the water column that is sequestered by  adults of the same species.  This project will identify the  chemical composition of the cue, and perform in situ  evaluation of the role of this cue on larval settlement, and  will distinguish the role of this water-borne cue versus the  larval attraction to chemicals from surface films on  substrata, which has been repeatedly documented.       This project will contribute to the program's objective  of making incremental steps in the understanding of the  mechanisms which control the input of larval propagules into  adult populations.  If the role of water-borne chemical cues  is indeed significant, this work could lead to the  restructuring of current theory in the recruitment ecology  of marine organisms.",
