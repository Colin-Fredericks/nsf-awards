 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Coalition for Education in the Life Sciences (CELS), a  network of life science professional organizations, is requesting  support for three conferences in 1995, 1996, and 1997 on  undergraduate life science education.  These will be the CELS IV,  CELS V, and CELS VI conferences.  The conferences will emphasize  assessment of educational programs, development of a life  sciences electronic clearinghouse, dissemination of information  about exemplary programs, and ways for improving faculty and  graduate assistant teaching and course design.  CELS IV will be  held in June, 1995, at The University of Wisconsin, Madison; CELS  V in 1996 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas; and CELS VI  will meet in Washington, DC.  The conferences will be limited to  175 participants to promote interaction and CELS encourages  faculty and administrators from the same institution to attend as  teams.  The format will include plenary sessions on broad topics  like assessment, smaller break-out discussions and hands-on  workshops, materials presentations and group discussions, and  demonstrations that show effective teaching.  The outcome will be  teaching materials and conference proceedings, which will be  disseminated through all the professional societies supporting  CELS and a self-sustaining CELS network for ongoing work in this  important area of undergraduate life sciences education.",
