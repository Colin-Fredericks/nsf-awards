 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510259  Daw    This work investigates the fine structure of dislocations in  the FeAl and NiAl pseudobinary systems.  Specifically, it  studies the details of dislocations and dislocation  reactions in these compounds, using both atomistic (embedded-  atom and tight-binding/density-matrix methods) and  anisotropic continuum calculations.  The investigator will  explore four key features: (1) the core structure and  mobility of a<111> dislocations; (2) the source of the yield  strength anomaly; (3) the mechanism of the slip transition;  and (4) deformation mechanisms above the slip transition.  He is closely coordinating this theoretical work with the  experimental efforts of Prof. Mike Mills of The Ohio State  University.  Such work will help to determine strategies for  obtaining improved low-temperature ductility and high-  temperature strength in these compounds.  %%%  This project theoretically investigates the properties of a  class of intermetallic compounds, namely, iron-aluminum and  nickel-aluminum.  These materials are of considerable  technological interest due to their attractive high-  temperature properties and excellent oxidation and corrosion  resistance (that is, they keep from rusting or breaking  down).  Applications include aerospace turbines,  semiconductor coatings, and automotive components.  In  particular, the investigator will look at linear defects in  these materials called dislocations that are responsible for  many of the properties of interest.  Once scientists better  understand the dislocations, then they can develop better  strategies in obtaining improved properties.  The  investigator is closely coordinating this theoretical work  with the experimental efforts of Prof. Mike Mills of The  Ohio State University.  ***",
