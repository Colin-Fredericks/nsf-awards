 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 15 years, processor speeds in modern computers  have increased at a much faster rate than main memory  speeds.  Thus, relative  memory latencies in both sequential  and parallel computers have become quite  large, and continue  to increase rapidly.  Such trends form the motivation for  this research, which attacks the issues of how to monitor,  analyze and improve  computer performance in the face of a  large processor-memory performance gap.  Because of this performance gap, it becomes increasingly  important to develop  performance monitoring systems that  allow programmers, compiler writers, and  system designers to  identify and tune portions of their design where memory  overhead is limiting performance.  To accomplish these  goals, this project  focuses on several area:  (i) exploring  hybrids of compile-time and run-time  software-based  techniques for application memory performance analysis, (ii)  combining these hybrid monitoring techniques with dynamic  compilation to  implement flexible, low-overhead, detailed  performance tools, (iii) designing  and implementing novel,  software-aware, hardware performance monitoring  techniques,  and (iv) designing software tools based on this novel  hardware  support.    By studying both hardware and software solutions  concurrently, one  gains insights into the strong and weak  points of each approach.  The end  result of this research is  a suite of performance tools that span a range in  the level  of monitoring detail provided and the level of hardware  support  required.",
