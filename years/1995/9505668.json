 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505668  Ramesh       The operations scheduling problem concerns the scheduling of  generating units in the most economic manner subject to several  constraints.  The problem is to identify which units should be ON  (committed) in each our over a period of time ranging from a day  to a week, and to determine the generation level of each  committed unit in each hour.  The main difficulty in solving the  problem is that it is a large mixed-integer nonlinear programming  (MINLP) problem, and is compute-intensive.  Because of this, the  algorithmic techniques currently employed do not model many  relevant constraints, and use several approximations which lead  to suboptimal solutions.  The main objectives of this research  are: a) to investigate and develop a new population-based  optimization technique for MINLP problems, and b) to use a  comprehensive model encompassing most, if not all, relevant  constraints for the operations scheduling problem.  The new  combinatorial optimization technique that we will explore in this  research is a decomposition methodology that evaluates a  population of solutions, in parallel, for each subproblem of the  over-all problem.  The approach will be applied to solve a  comprehensive model of the operations scheduling problem.  We  will investigate the complexity and optimality of the proposed  technique.  ***",
