 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417983  Thiq project is a study of the dynamic interaction of  transient weather systems with the surface katabatic wind  system inland from the Siple Coast in East Antarctica.  The  topography of the Siple Coast channels the cold air from  the interior into intense and persistent streams of  katabatic winds which flow out over the Ross Ice Shelf.    The periodic passage of synoptic-scale cyclonic storms  affects the structure and behavior of the surface wind  streams by reinforcing the surface flow into surge events,  extending for as much as a thousand miles across the Ross  Ice Shelf, and the katabatic winds may affect the  generation of cyclonic storms by forming a strongly  baroclinic zone on the Ice Shelf.    This project will integrate observations from a network of  nine automatic weather stations, multi-spectral satellite  imagery, and numerical modeling with the goal of testing  and elaborating upon hypotheses established from prior  investigations of the dynamics of katabatic winds.  Specific aspects to be addressed include the relative  importance of katabatic flows in West and East Antarctica,  evaluation of the impacts of pressure gradient and cloud-  radiative forcing, and the interaction of the katabatic  flow field with mesoscale cyclones.  ***",
