 "awd_abstract_narration": "9508051  Pandis        Organic aerosol is an important component of ambient particulate matter, whether in urban, rural, or  remote areas. Organic compounds represent on average 35% of the fine aerosol mass in urban polluted areas like  Los Angeles and their sources on a global scale are estimated to be similar to those of sulfate. They are an integral  part of the direct and indirect radiative forcing of climate by aerosols. Atmospheric aerosol pose significant  environmental risks (health problems, visibility degradation) in part because of these organic compounds. The in-situ  formation of secondary organic aerosol by condensation of low volatility products of the photooxidation of  hydrocarbons remains poorly understood.        This project will investigate the mass transfer of organic compounds from the gas to the aerosol phase. The  equilibrium partitioning of the major organic aerosol components between the gas and aerosol phases will be studied  by measuring the vapor pressures of their mixtures. The condensation rates of these organic compounds will be   quantified on a variety of model inorganic and organic aerosol substrates and the accommodation coefficients  calculated. The effects of the organic compounds on the evaporation rate of NH4NO3 will be determined, as well  as the influence of organic films on the rate of growth of organic and inorganic aerosols. The proposed experimental  system is based on the Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer technique. The results will be incorporated into a  state-of-the-art aerosol model and the model output will be tested with the best available urban air quality data set.        The educational efforts of this project will focus on the development of environmental classes for engineers.  A textbook in atmospheric chemistry will be developed and used for one of these classes. The application of  computer technology to the education of chemical engineers will be explored. Undergraduate students will be  involved in research both directly through  year long senior research projects and indirectly through the Engineering  and Public Policy project courses. Finally,  the development of environmental modules through the  Environment  Across the Curriculum  program of Carnegie Mellon University will contribute to the environmental education of  all engineers.",
