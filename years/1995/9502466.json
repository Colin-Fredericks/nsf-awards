 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9502466  Colorado School of Mines  John R. Dorgan    Research activities focus on the development of novel hybrid polymer systems for the manufacture of advanced materials.  Three research projects are pursued, the first pursues the development of fundamental theory useful as an aide to processing liquid crystalline polymers into molecular composites and high tenacity fibers.  The second research project studies new chemistries for the production of polymeric monolayers on inorganic surfaces and involves the use of Monte Carlo simulation techniques to understand such systems.  The third research area involves the design and characterization of polymeric binding systems useful in  new manufacturing process for advanced ceramics.    Innovative teaching methods are described which allow the PI to serve as an effective instructor in the classroom.  Plans include the integration of computers and laboratory exercises into the curriculum.  Additionally, the development of teaching methods which allow different types of learners to be successful students are pursued.  The educational infrastructure of the Colorado School of Mines is greatly improved by having the interdisciplinary field of Polymer Science and Engineering represented on campus.",
