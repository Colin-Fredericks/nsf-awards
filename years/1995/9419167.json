 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419167    Fish  use special sensory organs called lateral line systems  to  detect  water motion and  pressure changes  produced  by  underwater   sounds.    The   sensory   receptors,    called  neuromasts,  are usually sheltered in canals  but  sometimes  exposed  on the surface.  The canals are thought  to  filter  low frequency noise, like that produced by water motion from  stream  flow or active swimming, and improve the ability  of  fish  in  noisy environments to detect signals  produced  by  other  swimming  animals.  Lake Baikal  in  Siberia  is  the  world's deepest and oldest freshwater lake.  Its fish  fauna  is  dominated by sculpins which have evolved unusual lateral  line  systems  that  include mostly  superficial  neuromasts  except  for  a  few  species with  neuromasts  primarily  in  canals.   The  abundance of species with mostly  superficial  neuromasts  is  a unique feature of this ancient  lake,  and  provide  a  special  opportunity  for  the  study  of  canal  function.   The  lake  has  29  species  of  closely-related  sculpins,  most of which live in the quiet and dark  depths,  but  some  of  which come to the surface to feed  at  night.  This  research will examine the search behavior and  ability  to  detect  prey  of  the  Baikal  sculpins,  and  test  the  hypothesis  that  sheltering  neuromasts  in  canals  is  an  adaptation   to   foraging  in  noisy  environments.    Fish  responses  to  prey will be videotaped in  noisy  and  quiet  environments,  and reaction distances will  be  used  as  an  index  to  prey  sensitivity.  Anatomy of the  lateral  line  organs  will be documented using plastic casts of the  canal  systems  and  scanning  electron microscopy  to  count  hair  cells.   The  research  will determine  the  functional  and  adaptive significance of lateral line architecture.  It  may  ultimately lead to an understanding of the design  of  canal  structure  in filtering noise and increasing sensitivity  to  certain underwater signals.",
