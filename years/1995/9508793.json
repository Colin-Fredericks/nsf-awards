The objective is to  provide a continued  opportunity for researchers,  designers, and construction  specialists to exchange ideas  on the current state-of-the-  art in seismic risk  assessment, design and  construction for lifeline.  What future directions should  be pursued to improve current  methods, and what mutual  programs between the U.S. and  Japan can be initiated so that  the most effective use of  available information is  maximized will also be  discussed.    The possible areas of  collaboration identified for  discussion include:         -    Planning for urban  disaster prevention       -    Systems approach to  lifeline performance       -    Soil-Structure  interaction       -    Performance of  underground pipelines and  cables       -    Fire  prevention/protection       -    Geographical  Information Systems (GIS)       -    Cost-effective  ground improvement techniques       -    Development and  operation (including  restarting) of safe shutdown  systems.    This workshop is jointly  supported by NSF, National  Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) in the U.S.  and Public Works Research  Institute (PWRI), Ministry of  Construction, in Japan.  ***",
