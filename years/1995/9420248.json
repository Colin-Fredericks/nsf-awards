 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determining whether or not a previous event occurred represents a central use of memory in everyday life. This form of memory, referred to as recognition memory, plays an important role in a diverse range of practically-important behaviors, from eyewitness accounts of past events to childhood memories and the assessment of their validity.  A recognition memory judgment requires people to say whether they have or have not experienced a particular event.  Traditional investigations of recognition memory have emphasized the role of decision processes, as well as memory representations in influencing such recognition memory judgments.  The work proposed here attempts to uncover the mechanisms underlying decision processes in recognition memory using a range of experimental techniques and theoretical approaches.  We attempt to discover the factors that sytematically influence decision processes and the relation between these factors and observed memory performance. We hope to use these discoveries to construct models for measuring the validity of recognition memory across a range of situations.",
