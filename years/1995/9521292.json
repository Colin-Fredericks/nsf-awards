 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research Program.   The study will link theories of employment discrimination based on economic outcomes with those based on institutional processes to present a more comprehensive picture of the direct and indirect effects of laws on changing patterns of employment discrimination.  Analysis is based on civil cases of employment discrimination by states using existing and recoded data, newly assembled data from histories of state employment discrimination policies, and measures of employment inequality using census data.  The time covered is from 1960 to 1990.  %%%   This study will contribute to sociological understanding of the variable affects of anti-discrimination laws on the work experiences of women and blacks and add to theory and research in the sociology of law, social movements, and social stratification.  The findings will be of use to policy-makers concerned with the use of legal means to remedy  discriminatory practices.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.",
