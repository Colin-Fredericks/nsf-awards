 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500083  Song   This project investigates the problem of order-based approach to inventory management.  In order-based inventory control, the relationship between the demand of items is considered in setting the parameters for inventory control.  This is against the item-based approach which assumes that the demand of items in a system are independent of one another.  The objective of this research is to undertake a preliminary study to investigate the effectiveness of using order-based approach to inventory control.  The study will also determine how to set the inventory levels for items in an order-based system.  Components of the study includes modeling, performance measure evaluation, optimization, and comparison.   Correlated demand of items is a common event in inventory systems.  The outcome of this research is expected to assist inventory control managers to effectively manage the procurement of correlated items to minimize unnecessary inventory buildup and cost.  It will also provide some insight on how to characterize the inventory behavior of items with correlated demands.  This will help manufacturers and distributors improve their customer service.  ***",
