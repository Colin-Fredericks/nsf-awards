 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career Advancement Award for Women in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program  is in support of an ongoing research program in the flavor chemistry of wines. During the tenure  of this one year standard grant, Professor Mary G. Chisholm will spend nine months at the Lord  Zuckerman Research Centre in Reading, UK to gain exposure to new technology in food science  to support her research program. Upon her return she will train undergraduate students at the  Penn. State Erie-Behrend College in multidimensional gas chromatography (MDGC) to isolate  flavor bodies in wines. Chirality is known to play a major role in taste and odor perception,  although few methods exist to date to quantitate this effect. Prof. Chisholm will investigate use  of chiral gas chromatography using modified cyclodextrin columns to study the role of  enantiomeric components in determining the flavor and aroma in wines and other foods.  Results  from this work should allow a more objective means of correlating the chemical composition of  foods to their sensory evaluation.    In the past, the evaluation of color in food, clothing, paints, etc. was solely a subjective visual  evaluation fraught with variability and misinterpretation. Today, a modern system of  spectroscopic, computational, and sensory evaluations are made for quantitative color  comparison. A comparable system does not yet exist in flavor testing. Flavor perception involves  a combination of taste, odor, and texture and the interplay of these factors is not well-  understood. To date, flavor evaluation in foods and beverages is still a very subjective test. Out  of the hundreds of compounds that may exist in a food ingredient, only a few may contribute  to the observed flavor. In many cases the \"aroma-active\" component may have the same  chemical formula, but may differ only in the spatial orientation of chemical functional groups.  A combination of analytical testing, sensory evaluation, statistical and computational  methodology may be needed to id entify the flavor contributing species in food. Prof. Chisholm  and her undergraduate students at PA St. Erie-Behrend will use a combination of CHARM  analysis (sensory evaluation of volatile food components from a gas chromatograph) and MDGC  (controlled concentration and high resolution separation of gaseous analyte) to better define those  factors contributing to flavor in various wines. In addition, Prof. Chisholm will spend a nine  month sabbatical in one of the top Food Science institutions in Europe studying the application  of these techniques to wines.",
