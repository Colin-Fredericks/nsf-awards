 "awd_abstract_narration": "Civil engineers perform analyses and make design recommendations  for many types of structure including buildings, bridges, dams,  highways, water treatment, and waste disposal facilities.   A  significant aspect of analysis and design is the proper  understanding and evaluation of the stress history of the soils  upon which these structures will be built.   Current classroom  teaching methods do not fully demonstrate how different stress  histories affect the engineering properties of clay soils.  This  project implements a laboratory method that physically  demonstrates the significance of the stress history of clay soils  to undergraduate civil engineering students.   A clay soil is  mixed with enough water to produce a slurry.   This material is  then consolidated in four separate batch consolidometers to four  different consolidation pressures.   Thus, four quality samples  are produced from the same slurry having the same classification  and mineralogy but having different stress histories.   The  samples are then removed from the batch consolidometers and  tested in standard l-D consolidation, unconfined compression, and  triaxial test equipment to evaluate the consolidation and shear  strength parameters.   The data from these tests, along with the  analyses of problems using these test results, demonstrate the  significance of stress history on the engineering properties and  performance of the clay soil.",
