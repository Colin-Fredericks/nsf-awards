 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554494  Douglass    This CMU project endeavors to institute a mechanism to encourage  and support the participation of girls and women in science,  engineering, and mathematics (SEM) through:  raising the  awareness of teachers and parents with regard to the factors  affecting the success of girls in SEM; forming cross-age research  teams of women and girls; and developing a mentoring system  from elementary school through professional employment.  Mentoring  Through Cross-Age Research Teams impacts the eight extremely rural,  economically disadvantaged counties in central Michigan.  Five  regional education service districts totaling 33 school districts,  with participation from about 240 girls and teachers will be  directly involved in the project.  Research teams are to be formed  of elementary, middle, and high school girls, college undergraduate  and graduate women, parents, teachers, and professional scientists.   The teams provide mentoring, encouragement, and academic support  while working together on a common research project.  This research  endeavor is augmented by academic year and summer enrichment  programs to highlight the issues surrounding the success of girls  in SEM, introduce role models, and provide information on career  opportunities.    A spring \"project fair\" is to showcase the efforts of the research  teams, as will presentations at state conferences.  The development  and distribution of an administrator's guide will facilitate  replication of the project.  Presentations are to be made at  teacher in-service workshops and at the state Math/Science Center  Director's meeting to encourage sponsorship by other centers and  districts.  This project expects to continue as a regular event  coordinated by the Central Michigan Science/ Mathematics/Technology  Center and the regional education service districts.  ***",
