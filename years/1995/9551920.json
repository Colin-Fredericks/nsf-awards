 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposal will enhance pre-engineering instruction in  the following ways: (1) By extending a learning method based upon  microcomputer interfaced lab experiences.   The method has  already proven itself successful in pre-engineering physics  courses and now is being extended to an even greater number of  students in statics, dynamics, circuits, and other  pre-engineering classes.  (2) By providing an enriched lab  experience in the second year of engineering instruction.   This  instruction is built around a nearly \"standard experience\" of  engineering training stations common to most engineering  programs.   It also aids students greatly in career selections.   (3) By augmenting an already operating interactive TV network.    The project extends the ITV system into the pre-engineering lab  so that lab equipment, experiences, and learning can be shared  among two remote sites.",
