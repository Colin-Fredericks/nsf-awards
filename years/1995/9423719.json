 "awd_abstract_narration": "9423719  Kuhn       Homotopy theory and representation theory have quite distinct  origins, with the former being motivated by the desire to  understand the global structure of geometric objects such as  manifolds, and the latter evolving out of the study of how  algebraic structures act as symmetries on vector spaces.  Professor  Kuhn is continuing his study of the common ground between these  subjects, as typified by his development of \"generic representation  theory,\" which was originally inspired by work by topologists on  the Steenrod algebra, but which seems to offer new powerful tools  for understanding completely representation theoretic topics such  as the modular representations of the finite general linear groups  and the MacLane homology of algebraic K-theorists.  Among the  specific questions being studied are ones dealing with homotopy \"at  a large prime,\" topological realization questions, and the relation  between stable K-theory and MacLane homology.       Both homotopy theory and representation theory are  mathematical subjects in which one is trying to discover, and  ultimately classify, fundamental \"building blocks\" of structure:  homotopy dealing with deformations of geometric objects such as  higher dimensional surfaces, and representation theory being  concerned with symmetries of discrete algebraic objects such as  configurations of lines and planes.  Professor Kuhn is continuing  his study of some of the common ground between these, using  algebraic tools developed by him that were inspired by homotopy  theoretic experiences.  ***",
