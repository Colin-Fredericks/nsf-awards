 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ion implantation can change the properties of a surface without changing the underlying substrate.  This technology has growing applications to wear reduction and corrosion reduction of metal surfaces.  Many of these applications have been limited by the fact that implantation is usually a `line of sight process`. Plasma source ion implantation (PSII) has the potential to overcome this limitation as long  as the plasma can be made to `conform` to the surface throughout the implant's duration. Limitations in plasma density and power system drive conditions often limit the degree to which the implant conforms to the surface. By increasing the plasma density and power system peak power, those limitations can be overcome, leading to a significant improvement in the uniformity of the implant and a subsequent increase in implant utility as a surface modification technique. By combining NSRC's expertise in high current pulse transformer design with improved high density plasma sources North Star Research Corp.,  can develop a system which overcomes the present limitations of PSII. In this Phase I program, the researchers will use existing pulsed power equipment at NSRC along with a high density plasma source to make an initial study of the high density, high power PSII regime.  Preliminary implants will be performed to validate this new technique.",
