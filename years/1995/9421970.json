 "awd_abstract_narration": "The organization of the cortex of the brain is far from  being understood, despite extensive work on anatomy and  physiology, particularly on visual cortex.  We are still  revising basic principles, such as the usefulness of  multiple maps of sensory representations, the nature of  modular or topographic projections of neural pathways, and  the degree of strict hierarchy in ascending sensory systems.  This project uses sophisticated modern neuroanatomical  tracing methods to address problems of connections and micro-  circuitry within and between visual cortical areas of well-  studied functions.  The novel emphasis is to get extensive  quantitative details on cellular connections at the rarely  studied integrative level between the large-scale of  cortical mapping and the small-scale of single cells.  Data  are analyzed in terms of modularity, divergence, topographic  organization, and morphometry of the terminal branchings of  nerve axons.  Results will clarify the relative importance  of these various circuits for feedback and feed-forward  modulation of sensory processing.  These results will  contribute to a more comprehensive, quantitatively coherent  database of comparative cortical organization and  phylogenetic trends.   The potential impact extends beyond  visual neuroscience into evaluations of cortical  architecture, and cognitive and computational models of  network processing.",
