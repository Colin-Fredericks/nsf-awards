 "awd_abstract_narration": "This request is for an integrated system of state-of-the art  instruments for recording and analyzing human multi-joint  movement.  These instruments will enable simultaneous  measurement of movement kinematics (position-time  functions), kinetics (forces), and muscle activity patterns.  The system will be used for both research and research  training related to the control of human posture and  movement.  The focus of the research activities will d the  control of goal-directed arm reaching movements and  associated postural adjustments.  However, the system will  also support work on other multi-joint behaviors including  gait and balance control.  In addition to instruments for  measuring kinematics, kinetics and electormyographic (emg)  activity, the system will include a device for servo-  controlling the forces exerted hand during arm movements and  for controlling the visual information available to the  subject during visually guided reaches.",
