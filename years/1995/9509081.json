These interactions are accomplished by proteins which can recognize a specific RNA structure rather than a particular RNA sequence.  At present, identification of the physiologically relevant RNA ligand for a given RNA-binding protein is laborious and difficult.  As the number of proteins predicted to bind RNA continues to grow, there is an urgent need for a reliable method for identifying their RNA ligands.  To this end, this project will develop a \"3-hybrid\" genetic system, building on the concept of the well-known yeast 2-hybrid system.  A \"3-hybrid\" test system consisting of  two fusion proteins (the first and the second hybrids) and a \"bipartite\" RNA molecule (the third hybrid) will be produced in a yeast reporter strain.  If the specific \"sandwich-like\" protein-RNA-protein interaction can be achieved in vivo, then GAL4 transcriptional activity may be reconstituted, leading to the transcriptional activation of a reporter gene.  The long term goal of this research is to develop this in vivo screening method for identifying the RNA ligand for any given RNA-binding protein, or vice versa.  %%%  Specific RNA-protein interactions are crucial in a variety of biological processes.
