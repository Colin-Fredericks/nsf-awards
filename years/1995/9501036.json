 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501036   Russell      This project will support a joint exchange program involving Virginia   Polytechnic Institute and State University, University of Maryland,   Baltimore County and St.  Petersburg State University in Russia.  The   purpose of this exchange program is to allow the participants to explore   deep interconnections between theoretical developments in nonharmonic   Fourier series and potential applications in the control, estimation and   identification theory of distributed parameter systems.  The fact that most   recent advances in the theory of nonharmonic Fourier series have taken   place in Russia and the former Soviet Union, while applications have   enjoyed dramatic advances in the United States, makes this exchange   program particularly timely.  The program envisages five separate visits,   two on the part of United States participants to Russia and three involving   Russian visitors to the United States.      The use of nonharmonic Fourier series methods in control, estimation and   identification of distributed parameter systems, which dates back at least to   1963, is now of increasing importance because of sophisticated non-  invasive state estimation techniques required for newly sophisticated   advanced materials production and processing.  Nonharmonic Fourier series   techniques allow estimates of the interior state of a process to be generated   from externally collected data on temperatures, concentrations, etc., without   the need for invasive internal probing potentially interfering with the   process.",
