The aim is  to provide an opportunity for researchers to exchange ideas  on all aspects of Arabidopsis research, including genome-  related efforts.  The conference will include sessions on  embryonic and post embryonic development, environmental  effects on development, response to environmental stress and  pathogens, plant growth regulators, biochemical genetics,  cell biology, biochemistry, and genome-related research.  This is the first international Arabidopsis conference to be  held since the August 1993 meeting at Ohio State University  and the number of researchers using Arabidopsis has been  growing at a tremendous rate.  There were over 600  participants at the last meeting and a greater number is  expected to attend this meeting.  The conference will  maximize participation of young scientists by inviting  relatively young PIs, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate  students to give the majority of talks.",
