 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505003  Davis       The project of Professors Ruth Charney and Michael Davis  involves problems in topology, geometry, and geometric group  theory.  The main focus of the project is the study of piecewise  Euclidean polyhedra of nonpositive curvature (in the sense of  Gromov's CAT(0) inequality).  Understanding the local geometry of  such spaces is equivalent to understanding when polyhedra with  piecewise spherical metrics are \"large\" (i.e., satisfy the CAT(1)  inequality).  This project attempts to answer a number of questions  concerning \"large\" piecewise spherical polyhedra, as well as the  related question of when a negatively curved Riemannian manifold  supports a piecewise hyperbolic CAT(0) metric (with B. Okun).   Charney's research also includes the study of Artin groups via  geometric techniques; Davis's includes the study of certain  singular fiber bundles with applications to smooth torus actions on  manifolds (with R. Scott).       Groups are algebraic structures abstracting the concept of  symmetry, which is pervasive in mathematics and mathematical  physics.  The field of geometric group theory has, historically,  involved ideas from several areas of mathematics -- topology,  combinatorics, and group theory.  The recent introduction of  techniques patterned on differential geometry has led to exciting  new developments in the field as well as new applications to  problems in topology.  One of these techniques, a version of  \"nonpositive curvature\" for topological metric spaces, has played  a major role in these developments.  The project of Charney and  Davis aims at a better understanding of this notion of curvature  and how it may be applied to problems in topology and group theory.  ***",
