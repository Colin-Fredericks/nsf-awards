 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418164  Barry  The technique of infrared spectroscopy will be used to investigate  the relationship between structure and function in the  photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex, photosystem II.  These  experiments will focus on the manganese-containing catalytic site  and on the 33 kDa manganese-stabilizing extrinsic protein.  The  oxidation of water is a four electron event.  The manganese-  containing catalytic site of the photosystem II reaction center  accumulates these four oxidizing equivalents and cycles through a  series of five \"S states.\"  Vibrational spectroscopy will be used  to obtain information concerning the structural changes that occur  in the manganese cluster and in the reaction center upon  photooxidation.  Infrared spectroscopy will also be employed in  order to investigate the structure and functional role of the 33  kDa protein.  This proposal has three objectives: A) to use  difference infrared spectroscopy to measure and to identify the  structural changes that occur upon oxidation of the photosystem II  manganese cluster; B) to test the hypothesis that secondary  structure changes occur in the 33 kDa protein when this extrinsic  subunits binds to the photosystem II reaction center; C) to use  difference infrared spectroscopy to determine if removal of the 33  kDa protein influences the structural changes that accompany  oxidation of the manganese cluster.  %%%  Photosynthesis in plants involves the conversion of light energy  into chemical energy.  This process is carried out be the multi-  step transfer of electrons in membrane associated proteins.   Through this transfer of electrons, a relatively stable separation  of charge is built up across the membrane.  This charge separation  is the energy storage event and is driven by the energy of light.   The ultimate donor of electrons is water; the process of removal of  electrons from water results in the liberation of oxygen. This  oxygen production is critical for the maintenance of human life on  earth.  This propo sal will fund studies of the membrane associated  protein that is responsible for the production of oxygen.  Oxygen  producing chemistry occurs at a cluster of four manganese atoms.   Through the use of vibrational spectroscopy, we will obtain new  information concerning the structure and binding site of the  manganese cluster, as well as concerning the chemistry that occurs  at this metal cluster.  Vibrational spectroscopy is the ideal  technique to use to investigate these processes, since it is  exquisitely sensitive to small structural alterations.  ***",
