 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510185  Belitz  The objective of this project is to enhance the current  understanding of condensed matter systems that are subject  to quenched disorder.  Specific systems to be studied  include quantum ferromagnets, magnets in random fields,  disordered superconductors, and doped semiconductors, as  well as other systems that undergo a metal-insulator  transition.  The methods that he uses include the  construction of effective field theories, renormalization  group techniques, and many-body perturbation theory.  A  successful completion of the project will contribute to the  understanding of an important area of condensed matter  physics and will train technical personnel with expertise in  this field.  %%%  The project deals with a variety of materials, such as those  with a transition between metallic and insulating phase.  Such materials have frozen into them defects of some type  that will make the material insulating if their presence is  sufficiently strong.  Examples include magnets,  superconductors, semiconductors, and metals, each with one  or more special type of defects.  Often, defects are  intentionally introduced into materials to give them desired  properties.  The PI will use state-of-the-art theoretical  methods to study such phenomena.  The PI carries on a  fruitful collaboration with T. R. Kirkpatrick from the  University of Maryland.  ***",
