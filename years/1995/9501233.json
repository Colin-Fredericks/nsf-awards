 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9501233 Sattinger  The isospectral flows of a second order  energy dependent Schrodinger operator will be investigated. The  associated inverse scattering problem cannot be resolved by the  Gel'fand-Levitan-Marchenko method; but instead must be treated by  solving a Riemann-Hilbert problem on an appropriate Riemann  surface. The flows themselves divide into two cases. The two  distinct flows have global solutions only when the initial data  is restricted to suitable invariant submanifolds. The asymptotic  behavior of the solutions will be investigated using the recent  methods developed by Deift and Zhou for analyzing long time  asymptotics of solutions to Riemann-Hilbert problems. The nature  of the break-down of the solutions for inapprmpriate data will be  investigated. The Hamiltonian for the three wave interaction  contains a cubic interaction term and a kinetic energy term that  allows unbounded positive and negative energies, as in quantum  electrodynamics. The model thus contains a number of interesting  features, including creation and annihilation processes. The  model serves as a paradigm for such processes in elementary  particle physics.   Modern techniques for analyzing nonlinear  waves will be applied to models of physical interest. The first  model consists of equations approximating waves in fluids. These  models allow for singularities to develop, similar to waves  breaking in the ocean. An attempt will be made to analyze the  structure of the singularities. The second model consists of  quantum versions of classical equations that arise in nonlinear  optics. The system exhibits processes similar to those in  elementary particle interactions, in which particles are created  and destroyed.",
