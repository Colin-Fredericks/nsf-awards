 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  EEC-9527633  Thompson    Underground pipelines and storage tank systems can develop leaks over time and cause significant environmental damage.  A number of Government agencies have jointly recognized this concern and are joining together to facilitate a research and development program to be undertaken jointly by the New Jersey Institute of Technology's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Emission Reduction (ERRC) and Iowa State University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation (CNDE).     This collaborative effort will address the envisaged broad scope of a multi-university, multi-agency project.    The Emission Reduction Research Center (ERRC) at New Jersey Institute of Technology will be responsible for the interface with the sponsoring agencies, EPA, DOE, DoD, and NSF.  ERRC is studying how to modify the pipeline systems at the EPA UST/Pipeline Test Apparatus in Edison, NJ utilizing the research results of a prior award, EEC-9420695.  Researchers in collaboration with instrument manufacturers will characterize the nature of acoustic emission leak signals in the large scale pipeline systems.  Working collaboratively with researchers from the Center for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State University and utilizing the characterization data base, sensor placement and signal processing and analysis will be optimized for the range of leak size and location precision necessary to obtain a 95% reliability for leak location.  These results will provide another data base for the two Centers to test how effective the acoustic emission system will be in a number of \"real world\" operational sites.    The Center for Nondestructive Evaluation is studying the pipeline acoustics transmission characteristics to clarify interpretation of measured signals in this laboratory.  Tests will then be made on an outdoor buried, water filled pipeline using an artificial acoustic source and manufactured fluid leaks.  These results will be compared a nd analyzed to develop transit time-based leak location algorithms.  The algorithms will be tested against the experimental and theoretical data to establish units, performance and accuracy as a function of location, leak rate, etc.  The CNDE researchers will then assist in implementing the acoustic emission system for \"real world\" field tests, at various sites coordinated by NJIT and the participating agencies.    The researchers are fully qualified to perform these studies.    Funding for year one of this collaborative award is being provided by EPA, DOE, DoD, and NSF.  Dr. Ken P. Chong, Program Director, Structural Systems and Construction Processes Program, is providing the NSF funds.",
