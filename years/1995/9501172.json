Traces are being captured from a number of object-oriented programming environments.  A  workload characterization is being performed to identify the underlying problems presented by this new  programming model.  Architectural changes are then proposed to improve the execution performance of  object-oriented code.  This research is investigating architectural changes to the hardware that will improve  performance across all programming environments.  As more and more software is developed using object-  oriented languages, this research will have a direct impact on acceleration the performance of future  applications.    The educational part of this project is concerned with making improvements in the Computer Engineering  curriculum, student advising tools, classroom computer aids, and undergraduate research courses.",
