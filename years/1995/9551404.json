 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project updates and improves the curriculum and  instrumentation in the biology teaching labs at the college.    Five years ago, a three-phase plan was initiated to accomplish  this goal.   Phase 1 provided a high-speed network in biology.    Phase 2 developed faculty resources and provided a pilot lab for  testing the feasibility of this project.   Phase 3 provides 50%  of the teaching labs with a minimum of one workstation per two  students.   The Biology Department has been successfully  implementing Phases 1 and 2.   This project provides resources  for Phase 3.   The hardware and software obtained by this project  enable students to engage in hands-on experiments, reduce the  amount of time spent on equipment setup, analyze data more  effectively, work collaboratively in pairs, and use modern three-  dimensional anatomical software to extend their knowledge of  human anatomy.   This project enables development a dual-purpose  computer dry lab/wet lab with computer workstations that are  networked by high-speed Ethernet.   All workstations use a  product, Timbuktu, that allows each workstation to observe the  instructor's workstation or other student's workstations; all AV  workstations share a common audio/visual feed allowing images  (microscope, VHS tape deck) to be broadcast to each workstation;  and workstations have a pedestal-based computer stand that allows  the computer lab to be used either as a wet or dry lab.",
