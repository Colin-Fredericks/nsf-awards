 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Microtubules, which are subcellular \"pipe-like\" filaments  composed of the protein tubulin, and their associated motors,  dynein and kinesin, participate in many fundamental cellular  processes, including cell division, nerve growth and  regeneration, cell motility, and the organization and transport  of organelles within cells.  In these processes, microtubules  serve as rigid \"railroad tracks\" for the movement of motors and  their cargoes (\"trains\"), and the motors themselves are  efficient, high-velocity, regulative \"locomotives.\"  The  microtubles and microtubule motors of cold-adapted Antarctic  fishes are unique in their capacity to assemble and to function  at body temperatures (-2 to +2 oC) well below those of warm-  blooded and temperate organisms. The long-range goals of the  proposed research are to determine, at the molecular level, the  adaptations that enhance the assembly of microtubules, the  expression of tubulin genes, and the activity of microtubule  motors from Antarctic fishes in this extreme thermal regime.  The  objectives of this project are: 1) to determine the structural  features (e.g., changes in their amino acid sequences) that  enable the tubulins of Antarctic fishes to polymerize efficiently  at low temperatures; 2) to characterize the structure,  organization, and expression of an alpha-tubulin gene cluster  from an Antarctic rockcod, Notothenia coriiceps; and 3) to  examine the biochemical adaptations required for efficient  function of Antarctic fish flagellar dynein motors at low  temperatures.  Molecular adaptations of the Antarctic fish  tubulins will be determined by comparing the amino acid sequences  of alpha- and beta-tubulins from Notothenia coriiceps, to those  from its temperate relative, the New Zealand black cod,  Notothenia angustata.  Gene expression in N. coriiceps will be  analyzed by defining the organization and transcription-  regulating elements of an alpha-tubulin gene cluster.  The  structure of the cluster will be characterized b y sequence  analysis using standard DNA sequencing methods.  Features of N.  coriicepsalpha-tubulin transcription-regulating elements  (promoters) that support efficient gene expression at cold  temperatures will be assessed by use of reporter gene constructs  in primary cell cultures derived from N. coriiceps tissues.  Comparison to results obtained with N. angustata promoters should  help to delineate elements of alpha-tubulin promoter regions that  are important for high-level expression at low temperatures.  Finally, the biochemical adaptations required for efficient  function of N. coriiceps flagellar dyneins at low temperatures  will be assayed by measurement of the temperature dependence of  the motor activities of purified inner- and outer-arm dyneins.  For comparison, flagellar dyneins from the temperate trout Salmo  gairdneri (and possibly from N. angustata) will also be analyzed.  Taken together, these studies should reveal the molecular  adaptations of Antarctic fishes that maintain efficient  microtubule assembly, mechano-chemical motor function, and gene  expression at low temperatures. In the broadest sense, this  research program should advance the molecular understanding of  the cold-adapted mode of life,",
