 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the 1995 Sigma Xi forum.  The forum marks the 50th anniversary of Vannevar Bush's seminal report Science:  The Endless Frontier, with an examination of his assumptions about the role of the federal government in supporting scientific research.  The aim is to develop an updated national mission statement for science in the aftermath of the Cold War and to contribute to a guiding national vision for science and technology in the decades ahead.  Sigma Xi's extensive network of 500 chapters and clubs, with outreach into the academic, industrial, and governmental sectors, provides a solid base from which to stimulate this discussion.  The forum's format, patterned on previous successful forums, includes speakers, panels, and breakout groups over a period of two days.  Speakers include leaders in university and industrial research, as well as government and foundation officials.  Participants will include scientists and officials from private and public sector organizations.  A proceedings volume will include breakout group conclusions and recommendations as well as the texts of plenary addresses.",
