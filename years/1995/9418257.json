 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418257  Verner    This proposal addresses the topic of cotranslational import  of proteins into mitochondria.  This is a question of  fundamental importance, since the \"textbook\" view is that  protein import into mitochondria occurs via post-translation  import (release of peptide from polysome unattached to the  targeted membrane).  This view has resulted from high  profile research which places perhaps an unwarranted degree  of reliance on in vitro import reactions vs the in vivo  situation.  This high profile research has shown that post  translational import can occur in vitro, whether it does  occur in vivo, to the exclusion of the co-translational  mechanisms, is the question addressed by this proposal.  The experiments proposed examine the properties of  mitochondrial precursor proteins that may influence the  coupling of their synthesis and import and explore the  function of cytosolic chaperone proteins, as well as other  cytosolic components in the import reaction.  In experiments  related to the structure of precursor proteins, gene fusion  technology will be employed to generate various artificial  proteins that will be studied in both in vitro and in vivo  import reacitons.  The effect of mitochondrial presequences  and the relative stability of overall precursor structure  will be examined in order to determine the characteristics  of precursor proteins that influence their ability to be  imported by either a cotranslational or posttranslational  mechanism.  In addition, in vitro import reactions will be  performed to evaluate the involvement of other cytosolic  components in mitochondrial biogenesis.  Such components  will be identified and isolated using standard biochemical  procedures.  %%%  Results obtained from the proposed studies are anticipated  to add significantly to our understanding of  protein import  into mitochondria and other organelles.  The bulk of the  proposed experiments are designed to explore the integration  of mitochondrial biogenesis with other cellular  phenomena  such as cytosolic protein synthesis, translation rates, and  interactions between precursor proieins and cytosolic  components.  This is an important step in viewing the import  process in the context of the overall complexity of the  living cytosol and will be complementary to other work in  the field in which the process tends to be studied in great  detail but often in isolation of other cellular reactions.  ***",
