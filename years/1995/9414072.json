Stanton, Department of Physics, University of  Florida, to pursue with Dr. Chang Sub Kim, Department of Physics,  Chonnam University, Korea, for 36 months, a program of  cooperative research on dynamic processes on femto-second time  scales.  The objective of this research is to provide a secure  theoretical framework for a wide class of spectroscopic studies,  a generalization of existing theory to short times, and practical  models for comparisons with experiments.  Prototype systems of  interest include compound semiconductors of practical importance  such as GaAs an InP.  Examples of phenomena to be studied are  charge carrier dynamics at short times as observed by  femptosecond pump-probe experiments.    The proposed combination of experimental and theoretical  approaches will be used to provide fundamental information about  the physics of excited carriers in semiconductors and how they  impact electronic and optoelectronic device performance.  The  collaborators have acquired considerable complementary experience  in research related to the field of their proposed project.  This  project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea  Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of  cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers  through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills,  and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual  benefit.  Korean participation in the project is supported by the  Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
