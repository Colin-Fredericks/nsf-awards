Easter Seal affiliates serve as project sites, and  a sub-contract with the American Association for the Advancement of  Science led to development of a family-centered activity-based  science program.    The three major project components are: Family Science events,  including hands-on activities, visits by \"role models,\" take home  activities, and field trips; an Activity Manual containing twelve  themes to be used as the basis of Family Science workshops; Staff  Training for Easter Seal staff.    Target audiences are elementary and middle school age youth with  disabilities and their families.",
