 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective is to develop a new computational model of the large-  scale dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere by merging two existing  models: (i) the global 3d MHD code that was orginially developed at  the Naval Research Laboratory, and (ii) the Rice Convection Model  (RCM).  The merged code will retain the self-consistency and  comprehensiveness of the MHD code and will include the bow shock,  magnetosheath, solar-wind/magnetosphere interactions, as well as  the distant tail.  But the merged code will also utilize the Rice  Convection Model's finely gridded, many-fluid representation of the  inner magnetosphere and near-Earth plasma sheet.  In addition, the  RCM's representation of the magnetospheric interior will be  substanitally improved through the use of the self-consistent time-  dependent magnetic field supplied by the MHD model.  Merger of the  two codes will be accomplished in three phases, with careful  testing and analysis at each step.  In each phase, the code will be  used to simulate specific, well-observed magnetospheric events, and  simulation results will be tested against observations obtained in  GEM campaigns.",
