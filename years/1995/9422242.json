 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant  builds on the PIs' previous finding of implicit gender stereotyping, whereby an apparantly unconscious process of incorrectly assigning fame to familiarized male names generalizes only weakly to familiarized female names.  The major goal of the renewal period is to develop efficient individual- difference measures of implicit attitudes and stereotypes.  This effort will build on findings from the initial project period that, together with recent findings from other laboratories, suggest that judgment- latency methods are most likely to prove successful for this purpose. The statistical technique of confirmatory factor analysis will be used to examine sensitivity, reliability, and validity of the newly developed measures.  Efficient theory-based measures of implicit traits should be of great value not only to future research on this project, but also to many other researchers and, ultimately, in applied settings.  The research is designed to contribute to the goals of NSF's Human Capital Initiative, specifically in the social  context of disadvantage.  Consistent with these goal s, a program of research  examines basic  processes involved in categorizing people into groups and in the stereotyping associated with those  social categories.  By elucidating the role of implicit stereotyping in sustaining discrimination and  by developing and validating measures of implicit stereotyping and prejudice, the proposed research  will contribute basic tools that will be useful in applied research aimed at overcoming discrimination  and disadvantage",
