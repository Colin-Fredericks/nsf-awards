The underlying objectives  are to further characterize the structure, mechanism and function of these enzymes. The binding interactions between MnP, Mn and oxalate will be studied by kinetic spectroscopic and equilibrium dialysis methods. The oxidation of oxalate by MnP and the role of oxalate in the inactivation of MnP by H2O2 will be examined. Using a homologous expression system, the P.I. intends to construct, express and characterize site directed mutants of the Mn binding site of MnP. In order to understand how LiP oxidizes polymeric lignin, the LiP oxidation of several model polymeric substrates, including cytochrome c and ribonuclease, will be examined. In particular, the P.I.  will examine the role of veratryl alcohol in facilitating these reactions. Nucleophilic substitution and dimerization reactions will be used to monitor the formation of stable cation radicals during the LiP oxidation of dimetho xybenzenes. By examining a series of dimethoxybenzene and dimethoxybenzyl alcohol substrates,  the requirements for producing and stabilizing the cation radical intermediate in this reaction will be determined %%% Lignin is the most abundant renewable aromatic polymer in the biosphere. It constitutes 15 30% of woody plant cell walls, forming a matrix that surrounds the cellulose. This encrusting matrix significantly retards the microbial depolymerization of cellulose and thus lignin plays a key role in the earth's carbon cycle. The potential utilization of microorganisms for transforming lignocellulose into useful materials, chemicals and fuels is a significant field of research. Most studies on lignin degradation have focused on white rot basidiomycetes because these fungi degrade this polymer much more rapidly than other organisms. In addition, apparently they are the only organisms that completely degrade lignin to CO2 and H2O. The best studied lignin  degrading fungus is Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Since 1983 major breakthroughs have occurred in the study of the lignin degradative system of P. chrysosporium. The discovery and purification of two extracellular peroxidases involved in this process have stimulated a great deal of further research. Of major significance are the recent reports that both LiP and MnP are able to depolymerize synthetic lignin in vitro) and to oxidize several aromatic pollutants. Also of major significance is the work on the structure and mechanism of LiP and MnP. Three major goals of this project are: (1) to elucidate the structure and mechanism of the lignin  degrading peroxidases; (2) to establish the role of these enzymes in lignin and aromatic pollutant degradation; and (3) to study the regulation and expression of the genes encoding these enzymes. ***                                  @                                                                                                                                                       ....()()))()()                                                                      S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   @                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       marcia steinberg                    marcia steinberg            @    a  1:                          @                                   @    M  4:                                                                                                  @                                           Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     e =       e                                       w                                       \"       \"   \"       \"       \"       \"       \"       L       L       L       L       L       d       n       L           C   x       |       |       |       |       |       |       |                                   #",
