 "awd_abstract_narration": "ATLAST 1995/96 is a follow-up to the NSF sponsored ATLAST Project  to Augment the Teaching of Linear Algebra through the use of  Software Tools. The purpose of ATLAST is to encourage and  facilitate the use of software in the teaching of Linear Algebra.  The project seeks to bring about systemic change in the way Linear  Algebra is taught. The goal of ATLAST is to make the use of  software an integral part of all Linear Algebra courses.    ATLAST 1995/96 is offering two basic workshops on the use of  software in teaching Linear Algebra in 1995, one basic workshop in  1996, and one advanced workshop in 1996. Workshop participants are  learning to use existing Linear Algebra software packages and how  to incorporate those packages into their courses. Participants are  expected to design their own computing exercises and projects at a  level suitable for an undergraduate Linear Algebra class. These  exercises are being class tested during the school year following  the workshop and then submitted for inclusion in the ATLAST  database.      The best of the ATLAST 1995/96 exercises are being included in a  second ATLAST Exercise Book which is being published by the  Mathematical Association of America. Selected ATLAST materials are  included in the Mathematics Archives at the University of  Tennessee, Knoxville. These materials can be accessed by the  greater mathematics community through the Internet.    ATLAST 1995/96 is also offering one advanced workshop for those who  are already experts at developing computer exercises for Linear  Algebra. The purpose of this workshop is to develop exercises for  the second ATLAST book. Participation in the advanced workshop is  by invitation only.",
