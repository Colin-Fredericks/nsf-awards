Kent Kirk and Dan Cullen, Forest Products Laboratory,University of Wisconsin,  Madison, and Prof. Rafael Vicuna, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.  The  aim of this project is to advance the characterization of the ligninolytic system of  the white-rot basidiomycete Ceriporiopsis subvermispora , mainly at the genetic  level, with the goal of improving the  treatment of wood pulp by the use of  biological methods. The joint research will be performed in both the Madison and  Chilean laboratories.  The investigators' past collaboration has shown that there are  fundamental differences in enzyme expression patterns in defined liquid media vs.  solid substrates.   With these results in mind,  the present study 's emphasis is  directed toward characterizing the enzymes and genes expressed in complex, woody  substrates.       This is very important research.  The basic information obtained from the study  could potentially be utilized to improve the efficiency of the fungus in biopulping  and it is believed that biological treatment of wood fiber during processing with  either whole-cell ligning-degrading microorganisms or microbial enzymes may  someday eliminate the use of polluting compounds that are presently used.   ***",
