NOAA and NSF have been involved in the official  U.S. bilateral agreement with the People's Republic of China for  about fifteen years.  It has resulted in many accomplishments in  the areas of tropical and monsoon meteorology, mesoscale  meteorology, and climate studies.    The meeting is one in a series, held every two years, where the  U.S. and the PRC meet to discuss science accomplished and future  plans for the next two years of joint research.  The meeting is of  direct benefit to NSF (ATM) in planning its science agenda in  regard to joint work with U.S. PIs and the PRC.",
