 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational complexity theory, examines combinatorial problems  and classifies them based on the computational resource needed to  solve them.  One of the most important and commonly studied  resources is the time needed to  solve a particular problem.  Nondeterministic computation can be viewed as a  process of  guessing an answer to a problem and then checking to see if the  guess is correct.  Many problems that have deterministic solution  that require  exponential time to compute also have  nondeterministic solutions that can be  computed in a reasonable  amount of time.  In general, problems in complexity  theory have  been stated as questions concerning set membership.  An  alternative is to consider the more general case of partial  functions.  The  advantage of considering functions as opposed to  set membership question is  that a function value can be an  instance of a solution to a problem, whereas, a  corresponding set  membership question just states the existence of an instance.  Although work has been done on the study of function classes to  date these  classes have not been examined as closely.  This work examines the  structure and relationship of both deterministic  and nondeterministic function  classes, primarily focusing on  classes which are in the polynomial-time and  exponential-time  hierarchies, specifically considering these classes under  certain  models which use restricted resources.  The resources considered  include bounding the length of the function value to less  than the computation  time and limiting the access of the  computation to additional information that  may be provided by an  oracle set.  Further, through the study of function  classes one  can draw insight into the structure of corresponding classes of  sets.  Probabilistic models for function classes are also studied to  determine an appropriate description of interactive  proof systems in this  environment.",
