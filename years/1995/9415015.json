 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tulane School of Engineering, established in 1894, has long been recognized for excellent undergraduate and graduate education, and for its research activities. To ensure the School's continued success, modern research facilities are essential. Therefore, the top priority of Tulane's Engineering Centennial Campaign is the renovation of outmoded buildings in the Engineering Complex, namely, Stanley Thomas Hall, which houses the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; the Civil Engineering Building, home to the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering;  and a section of the Mechanical Services Building, that houses several computer science, civil engineering, and environmental engineering facilities. Both Stanley Thomas Hall and the Civil Engineering Building have served Tulane faculty and students well since the early 1900s.  However, these buildings have not kept pace with the technological advances of the 20th century, or the needs of the School's research faculty.  Last renovated in the 1950s, the buildings do not have the appropriate electrical, ventilation systems, or other utilities adequate for contemporary technology.  With the growing interdependence among engineering disciplines, research programs cannot excel if any of its components are unable to reach their full potential.  Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will assist the institution in its endeavor to renovate antiquated engineering research and research training facilities.  Renovations include the modernization of electrical, HVAC, and plumbing systems, provision of computer network capabilities, and fixed equipment.  In addition to enhancing current engineering research programs, the improved facilities will promote thriving interdisciplinary programs in robotics, and sensing, communication and computing. Furthermore, the renovations will provide the required support that will accelerate research in advanced materials and processing, advanced manufacturing technology and environmental research.",
