 "awd_abstract_narration": "9400912  Nirenberg       This award supports mathematical research on problems  arising in the field of nonlinear partial differential equations.   They include second order elliptic equations in general domains  in Euclidean n-dimensional space as well as on manifolds.  Regularity conditions will not be assumed and the differential  operators are not necessarily self-adjoint. Other work will focus  on free boundary problems, in particular singular limits for  nonlinear problems and Liouville-type theorems for application to  nonlinear boundary value problems.   A second line of  investigation involves statistical mechanics for wave equations.   Specifically, statistical/mechanical probabilistic methods will  be employed to study classical and non-classical nonlinear waves.   A new (integrable) shallow water equation which has interesting  connections with geodesic flow on creased manifolds of otherwise  constant curvature.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
