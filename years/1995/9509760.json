 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509760  McGreevy    This work is supported by a Research Planning Grant for Women  Scientists   and Engineers Award.  The project will involve conducting a  preliminary   investigation and setting the ground work for a full nonlinear  study of flame   propagation in a closed tube.  The nonlinear stability analysis  will be carried   out by investigating, via asymptotic analysis, bifurcation  theory, multiple   time scales, and numerical analysis, the evolution of finite  amplitude   disturbances superimposed on an otherwise smooth planar flame.   The goal   of the project will be to identify the roles of hydrodynamic and  diffusional-  thermal processes and the role of the mixture composition on the  stability   properties and complex spatial and temporal dynamics of the  process.  The   first part of the study will concentrate on the stage of the  combustion   process prior to when acoustic disturbances become significant,  as   manifested by a rapid acceleration of the flame, shock wave  formation   ahead of the flame, and transition from laminar to turbulent gas  flow.  The   second part of the study will involve examining the fully coupled    fluid/acoustic transition process.    The National Science Foundation's mandate to ensure the vitality  of the   Nation's scientific enterprise includes concern for the quality,  composition,   distribution and effectiveness of the human resource base in  science and   engineering.  Within this context, the Foundation is committed to  enhancing   the current rate of participation of women in science and  engineering   careers, in general, and as active participants in all of its  programs.    Research Plannine Grant awards are made: (1) to help increase the  number   of new women investigators participating in NSF's research  programs; and,   (2) to facilitate preliminary studies and other activities  related to the   development of competitive research projects and proposals by  women who   have not previously had independent Federal research funding.    Research   Planning Grants are one-time awards that may be used for  preliminary work   to determine the feasibility of a proposed line of inquiry,  and/or for other   activities that will facilitate proposal development.",
