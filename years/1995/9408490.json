 "awd_abstract_narration": "Isbell    Under the direction of Dr. William Isbell, Mr. John Besom will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Early Spanish records  describe cultural practices followed by the Inca empire in Peru,  Chile and Argentina. They indicate that humans were sacrificed by  the Incas for many different reasons and that in some cases  victims were left above ground at high altitude sites. A number  of such \"burials\" and accompanying grave goods have been  discovered at both high and low altitude situations. Mr. Besom  will study all of these remains and visit museums in the three  relevant countries. His work will include examination not only of  the bodies themselves, but also the clothing of the victim and  the related grave goods.     Mr. Besom's goal is to understand the strategies which were used  by the Inca to establish an empire which extended across vast  areas and encompassed many different linguistic and ethnic  groups. The Inca empire stands as a monument to human  organizational ability given the area involved, the difficulty of  communication across it and the fact that the Incas lacked both  written language and wheeled vehicles. Ethnographic and historic  documents indicate that religion and the manipulation of  religious beliefs provided an important method for political  control and that the sacrifice of human victims constituted an  important part of this system. Many types of sacrifice were noted  - the function of each differed. Through a systematic and  complete study of all known samples, Mr Besom hopes to gain  insight into Inca social and political organization.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light  on how large scale empires first arose and were maintained and it  will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
