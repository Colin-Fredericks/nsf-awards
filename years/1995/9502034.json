The mathematical methods emphasized will be those that  seek to characterize nonlinear systems in terms of their input-  output behavior.  This viewpoint is flexible and can accommodate  real world uncertainties and complicated nonlinear behavior.   Recent breakthroughs regarding control of systems with hard  limits on the magnitude and permissible rates of control signals  have developed by taking this view.  Part of the research plan is  to show that the algorithms which have been developed for the  control saturation problem are applicable to a wide variety of  problems.  The significance of the control algorithms will be  enhanced by investigating optimization strategies and  rapprochement with more standard control algorithms.  Indeed,  these algorithms may provide a link between standard control and  more recent \"intelligent\" control.  The second part of the  research plan seeks to develop both conceptual insight into and  computational algorithms for nonlinear control by taking a  general input-output point of view.  It is believed that this  will lead to results analogous to many fundamental results that  are known for linear systems: a parameterization of stabilizing  compensators, optimization over such parameters, simultaneous  stabilization, etc.  Software development will be a means of  transporting the research developments of this proposal to the  industrial sector.         The educational objective of this research is to facilitate  a learning environment which is tailored to the unique aspects of  today's engineering student.  The premise is that today's  students are very different from those that preceded them, with  regard to perspectives, values and expectation.  Accordingly,  changes in teaching styles and perspectives must be investigated.   The educational plan calls for critical self-and outside-  examination of teachin g styles and methods.  Partially, this will  occur within the structure of a faculty development program at  the University.  In addition, the plan calls for a thorough re-  examination of laboratory teaching methods, especially in the  subfield of control.  A consideration of visualization techniques  as a teaching tool is emphasized.  Finally, a teaching approach  that motivates the student through the history of and vision for  electrical engineering and control is recommended.  In this  regard, mentoring is seen to be a crucial part of the education  process.  ***",
