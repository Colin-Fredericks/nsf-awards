In previous work  funded by NSF, it was shown that the yeast Saccharomyces  cerevisiae has an osmosensing signal transduction pathway  called the HOG kinase (encoded by HOG1) and a MAP kinase  kinase (encoded by PBS2).  Mutants lacking either gene have  specific defects in the high osmolarity-induced expression  of proteins need for osmoregulation and osmotolerance.  This  laboratory recently made the exciting discovery that yeast  cells exposed to an increase in osmolarity temporarily  arrest their cell cycle in the G2 phase; hog 1 and pbs2  mutants are defective for this osmotic stress response.  The  mechanism responsible for this cell cycle arrest is  currently unknown, but the working hypothesis is that Hog1p  negatively regulates a G2-specific function of the cyclin-  dependent protein kinase Cdc28p.  The long-range goal is a  molecular understanding of how the cell cycle is regulated  by osmotic stress.  The specific focus of this project is to  determine how the HOG pathway induces a G2 phase arrest.  Two major objectives are (1) to investigate mechanisms  required for high osmolarity-induced, Hog1-dependent  regulation of the function of the cyclin-dependent kinase  Cdc28 in G2, and (2) to isolate and characterize the  molecular targets of the HOG pathway that mediate G2 arrest.  Specific experiments to meet the stated objectives are: (1)  Use G2-phase cells to determine the effect of high  osmolarity and HOG pathway mutants on the histone H1 kinase  activity of the G2 cyclin/Cdc28 complex, the in vivo  stability of the G2 cyclin/Cdc28 complex, and the cellular  content of G2 cyclins.  It will be determined whether Cks1  or other known Cdc28-associated proteins mediate Hog1  regulation of G2-specific Cdc28 functions. It will also be  determined whether changes in Cdc28 phosphorylation mediate  Hog1-induced G2 arrest.  The physiological significance of  G2 arrest by Hog1  will be investigated by determining  effects of osmotic stress and the hog1 mutation on cell  cycle landmark events.  2) Use affinity chromatography and  co-immunoprecipitation to isolate and characterize Hog1- or  G2 cyclin/Cdc28-associated proteins mediating Hog1-induced  G2 arrest.  Results of this molecular analysis of cell cycle  regulation by an osmotically-regulated protein kinase  cascade will provide an important experimental paradigm for  studies on similar osmotic response pathways active in other  eukaryotic systems.  %%%  This project addresses a new feature of a signaling pathway  recently discovered in yeast by this investigator in a prior  NSF award.  The signaling pathway is the High Osmotic-stress  activated Genes (HOG) which apparently have influence over  the normal progression through cell division.  If the cells  are exposed to high osmotic conditions, such as high salt or  sugar concentrations,  they normally arrest the cell cycle  in the period of time called \"G2\", the Gap of time between  DNA synthesis (S phase) and mitosis (M phase).  Cells with  an inactive HOG1 gene, do not arrest in G2, rather they  continue on to divide, often abnormally.  The transition  from G2 into M has been shown to be controlled, in part, by  the cyclical assembly of complexes of a phosphorylating  enzyme, or kinase, which is the product of  the Cdc28 (Cell  Division Control 28) gene and proteins called cyclins, which  are, in most part, cyclically made during the progression  through the cell cycle. The cyclins which are made during G2  and allow progression through the G2/M transition are called  the G2 cyclins.  Cyclins which allow progression through the  G1 (the Gap of time between mitosis and DNA synthesis)/S  transistion are called G1 cyclins. The focus of this project  is how the nature of the complex formed by G2 cyclins and  the Cdc28 kinase is influenced by the Hog1. The activity,  stability, and associations with other proteins are all  candidates for Hog 1 action.  To determine if  other  regulatory components are present in the G2cyclin/Cdc28  complex which mediate Hog1-induced cell cycle arrest, the  other components will be identified and isolated by virtue  of their association with components of the complex. This  work is important because it may  serve as a model for  fungal and plant cellular response to a changing  environment, such as partial desication or increase in  salinity, both of which change the osmotic conditions of the  cell.  ***",
