(CCITT), a consortium of 12 community colleges across the United  States, all linked with a local NASA Center, is conducting six  faculty development workshops (two each) in remote sensing, image  processing, and geographic information systems.  An earth systems  science course with a self-standing laboratory utilizing remote  sensing, image processing, and geographic information systems is  being developed as well as an interdisciplinary curriculum module  having multiple strands which utilize the technologies above.  The  interdisciplinary modules can be infused into science and  technology courses at CCITT institutions and other community  colleges throughout the United States.           Community college members of CCITT include:  Brevard Community  College, FL, Cuyahoga Community College, OH, Foothill-DeAnza  Community College District, CA, John C. Calhoun Community College,  AL, Pasadena City College, CA, Pearl River Community College, MS,  Prince George's Community College, MD, Thomas Nelson Community  College, VA, and Houston, TX-based Consortium for Aeronautical  Technical Education composed of San Jacinto Community College,  College of the Mainland, Alvin College, and Lee College.           NASA Headquarters and local NASA Centers are supporting the  faculty development/curriculum work. The remote sensing workshop is  being held at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,  Maryland with a portion of the instruction being provided by NASA  scientists and engineers.  Scie ntists from AMES are involved with  the two image processing workshops to be held at Foothill College.   Individuals from academe and industry with GIS experience support  the two GIS workshops.",
