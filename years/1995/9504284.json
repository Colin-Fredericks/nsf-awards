 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Hiroshi Higuchi of the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Manufacturing Engineering at Syracuse University and Professor Motoki Hinada of the Research Division for Space Systems Engineering at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS).  Project funding will enable Dr. Higuchi to spend four months in Japan, resident at ISAS, in order to study the flow-bluff-body interaction problem related to space recovery systems. The project has the potential to have an important influence on the infrastructure of aerodynamics through the sharing of information and joint technological advances arising from the close cooperation with the research group in Japan.  This proposal brings together research engineers from two countries working in the area of fluid dynamics. The U.S. engineer will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques, data, equipment, and facilities at ISAS while contributing to the overall research effort. Additionally, the extended visit by Higuchi will help him to establish a personal and pr ofessional link with a leading researcher in Japan.  It is also hoped that this visit will initiate a long term cooperative agreement for exchange of scholars and students between Syracuse University and ISAS.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.",
