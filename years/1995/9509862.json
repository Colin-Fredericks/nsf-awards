 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a one year project  proposed by Drs. Ray Herrmann  and William Back and Mr. Ivan Johnson, American Water  Resource Association (AWRA).  This proposal requests $10,000  for five representatives from five developing countries in  the East Asian and Pacific region to attend the American  Water Resource Association (AWRA) summer symposium on water  resources and environmental hazards.   Fresh water is an  important issue in the East Asia and Pacific countries,  particularly in many developing  East Asian countries where  there are high rates of population and economic growth.  The  involvement of scientists  from these countries is  important, since these scientists  have first hand of  information concerning problems in water quality and  quantity and ecosystem integrity.    These scientists will  also participate in special workshops to assess the need for  a network for scientists and policy makers from Oceania, the  Pacific Islands, and the Pacific Rim countries to develop a  prioritized research agenda relating to regional water  issues and to determine the scope of such a research agenda,  as well as to identify critical  water problems across the  region.    The modest cost to involve scientists from  developing countries is well justified since the potential  gain in advancing understanding of global water issues is  great.",
