 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505153  Martin       Martin will work in set theory and descriptive set theory, especially  determinacy hypotheses, and his first goal is to complete his long-awaited   research monograph on proofs of determinacy from large cardinal axioms.   Steel will also work generally in set theory and descriptive set theory,   and more specifically on the construction and study of canonical, inner   models of ZFC that satisfy specified large cardinal or determinacy   assumptions.  Moschovakis will work on fixpoint recursion and its   applications to the theory of computation, including the mathematical   modeling of recursive algorithms, the logic of recursive definitions, and   the construction of canonical solutions for recursive equations in   non-deterministic and concurrent settings.       The Principal Investigators of this Grant have been among the key  contributors to the reshaping of the classical, set-theoretic foundations of   mathematics during the last twenty-five years, with the introduction and   study of new hypotheses about sets that have made it possible to solve many   long-standing, open problems about the real numbers.  Martin and Steel will   continue working on this fundamental program, seeking to extend it and to   delineate its limitations.  Moschovakis changed interests about ten years   ago, and his current research program aims to provide a rigorous,   mathematical foundation for computer science.  One of the main, ultimate aims   of his work is to construct a \"logic of programs\" that will be useful in   the development and verification of computing systems.  ***",
