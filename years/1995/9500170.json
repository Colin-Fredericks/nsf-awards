 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500170  Gea       This award provides support for the development of an  integrated design tool for optimizing the shape and topology of  three-dimensional shells with stamping-bead stiffeners.  A novel  approach, Multi-material Design Domain Method (MDDM), will be used  to model different bead configurations.  In conjunction with a  Generalized Convex Approximation (GCA), the optimal shape and  layout of beads will be obtained.  Based on the direction of  principal strain, the orientations and configurations of bead  design will be precisely identified.  To ensure that the final  design has the optimal shape and topology, a sizing and shape  optimization process will be integrated into this method.       Once the proposed methodology is developed, it will benefit  our automotive and aerospace industries in three-dimensional shell  assembly design.  This method will shorten product development time  and produce optimal designs with the greatest saving in resource.   The concept of this method can also be extended to many other  applications and result in a new tool for product design.   Consequently, it could lead to products with higher quality and the  lower cost being brought to the marketplace more rapidly.",
