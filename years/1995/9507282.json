This investigator has isolated an ion channel from bacterial membranes which is composed of polyhydroxybutyrate and polyphosphate.  The polymers combine to form a calcium-selective ion channel with many of the same properties as the protein calcium channels found in plant and animal cell membranes.  The capacity of polyhydroxybutryate and polyphosphate to form ion channels derives from the ability of the polyhydroxybutryate to dissolve salts,  and that of polyphosphate to bind some cations more strongly than others.  The ion-selective properties of  polyphosphates have led to their use in water-softening, and the solvent properties of polyhydroxybutyrate are very similar to those of the polyethers used in lithium batteries, suggesting that polyhydroxybutryate can be used to prepare ion-conducting materials.  In this research  the effects of temperature, pH and salts on the conductance and selectivity of the polyhydroxybutryate/polyphosphate ion channel s  extracted from E. coli  as well as complexes reconstituted from their components uill be determined.  These complexes will be incorporated into planar lipid bilayers and studied with voltage clamp techniques.  Computer molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics computations will  determine the most likely conformations of the polymers in the channel complexes and elucidate blocking mechanisms.      %%%  These studies on these polymers in channel complexes will provide new insights into the mechanisms of ion-conduction in biological ion channels and bulk phase polymer electrolytes, and suggest new applications in material science. ***                         ;                                       Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       Abstract                            Barbara Zain                        Barbara Zain                @    q    S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   *                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1                          @                                   @      \u0131o9                                                                                                  @    F #                                    Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      2                                                                                       ;                                                                                                                                          e =       e                                                                               l       l   l       l       l       l       l                                                                       D   1                                                                                               #                   &       u   T       4   D                       l                                                                         D               l       l                                                                       l               l                                                       l       l       l       l                           7                                                                                                 Abstract 9507282 Reusch   Polyhydroxybutyrate and polyphosphate are polymers found in all biological cells, yet their functions are largely unknown.
