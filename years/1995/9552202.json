Students conduct several weeks of  structured exercises to familiarize them with the use of equipment,  followed by 7-8 weeks of student designed and executed  mini-research projects.  The new course builds on and extends  skills students are learning in the Department's newly-designed  introductory level core courses that feature investigative  laboratories, and provides students the opportunity to pursue  curiosity-driven experiments in a somewhat structured format.  To  establish the laboratory, which emphasizes cellular neurophysiology  and neuron-muscle interactions, electrophysiological setups  centered on the Macintosh computer-based MacLab data acquisition  and analysis system have been acquired.  This system allows digital  storage and manipulation of physiological data, which is acquired  using micromanipulators, preamplifiers for intracellular recording,  and stimulators/stimulus isolation units.  The experience benefits  not only those students who choose to pursue postgraduate studies  in biology or medicine, but will also provide an important  education in the methods of scientific investigation for students  who pursue careers in education, public service, law, etc.",
