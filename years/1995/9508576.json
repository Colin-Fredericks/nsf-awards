These programs will   strengthen the links between industry and academia and identify and encourage new avenues of   research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry Postdoctoral Research   Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the   mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing to the future vitality of the   scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral fellow will work closely with scientific advisors   from both academia and industry.   The postdoctoral fellow will work under the dipection of Ellis Cumberbatch at   Claremont Graduate School and Tuncer Cebeci at McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. This   research will bring together computational fluid dynamics and computational structural   dynamics so that fluid-structural interaction problems can be analyzed. The results will be   applied to a wing/fuselage/nacelle/pylon configuration corresponding to a wide-body MD-12   airplane with a supercritical wing.",
