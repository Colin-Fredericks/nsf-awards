Each  conference is devoted to a small number of topics, and the aim is  to create a focussed environment, conducive to a lively exchange of  ideas, in which this regional community of geometers can benefit  from contact with some of the leading contributors in those  selected fields.  Identifying themselves as active members of the  world community of differential geometers gives young  mathematicians, in particular, a sense of wider purpose and guides  them into more productive and relevant research paths.       A series of three annual meetings will be held, respectively,  at Washington University, St. Louis, MO, in 1995, at the University  of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, in 1996, and at the University of Kansas,  Lawrence, KS, in 1997.  The St. Louis meeting is centered on four  plenary addresses: Robert J. Zimmer, University of Chicago, on  Differential Geometry, Dynamics, and Rigidity of Group Actions;  Francis Bonahon, University of Southern California, on Three-  Manifolds, Hyperbolic Geometry, and Foliations; Chuu-Lian Terng,  Northeastern University, on Submanifold Theory; Claude Lebrun, SUNY  at Stony Brook, on Kaehler Geometry and Special Metrics.  Based on  the experience of previous years, the organizers expect the  participation of approximately 60 to 70 faculty mathematicians and  graduate students.  ***",
