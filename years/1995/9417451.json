 "awd_abstract_narration": "9417451  Yakovenko  The research involves the theory of quasi-one-dimensional  organic conductors with the emphasis on their behavior in  strong magnetic fields.  These artificially synthesized  conductors demonstrate metallic, insulating,  superconducting, charge- and spin-density wave, and Hubbard  paramagnetic insulator states.  Their rich physical  behavior, especially in magnetic fields, and its relation to  high temperature superconductors and the quantum Hall effect  makes these materials very desirable objects of study.  Proposed research includes the quantum Hall effect of a  moving density wave, \"hot spots\" on the Fermi surface, the  fraction quantum Hall effect, localization and the Hall  effect in high magnetic fields, the structure of the spin  density wave order parameter, and the effects of  superstructure produced by the orientational ordering of  anions.  Close connection with experimental studies is  anticipated.  %%%  This work involves theoretically studying special large  molecules that are stacked over each other and form parallel  chains which are good conductors of electricity.  These  materials have a wide variety of interesting properties,  including superconductivity, and are therefore known as  exotic materials.  Developing a theory of these materials  has particular advantages because of their chain-like  character.  The investigator is an expert in these materials  and is highly regarded in the community.  He especially  wants to focus on the properties of these materials in a  magnetic field and to connect with experimental studies.  Materials such as these often demonstrate completely  unexpected properties, so their study has the possibility of  resulting in applications which cannot currently be  predicted.  ***",
