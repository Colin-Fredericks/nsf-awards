 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  James F. Rathman  Ohio State University  CTS-9528627    Reduced utilization of hazardous organic solvents in industry is necessary to minimize the environmental impact of chemical manufacturing processes.  In the past, pollution control was largely achieved by separation techniques designed to remove hazardous materials from waste streams prior to their release into the environment.  Recently the emphasis has switched to source reduction as the optimum pollution control strategy, wherein non-hazardous materials are used in place of hazardous components.  The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate aqueous surfactant solutions as replacements for organic solvents in synthesis processes of interest to the photographic, pharmaceutical, polymer, and petrochemical industries.  The catalytic effect of surfactant micelles on a wide variety of reactions is well-known.  Despite the wealth of fundamental knowledge, primarily because kinetic data alone are not sufficient for successfully replacing organic solvents with aqueous surfactant solutions in existing processes.  For example, premixing of components via emulsification and separation of products after reaction are two additional areas that must be addressed.    In order for micellar catalysis to be economically viable, acceptably high production rates must be achieved, selectivity of the desired product must be attained, and methods of separating products and surfactants must be identified.  High production rates require maximizing solubilization of lipophilic reactants in aqueous media, as well as preparation and handling of two-phase water-continuous emulsions.  Surfactant mixtures, which often exhibit synergistic solubilization capacities relative to single surfactant systems, will be investigated.  Reaction rates and product yields will be investigated for alkylation reactions of phenols, aromatic amines, and amino phenols.  Methods of separating the desired product from the post-reaction solution, and methods of recovering the su rfactant for recycle, will be developed and evaluated.  Finally, a bench-scale semi-batch process will be designed and constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology.    This project will be performed in collaboration with the Chemicals Developed Division of the Eastman Kodak Company.  The nature of he collaboration will include working closely with industrial scientists and engineers to define reaction systems of interest and possible avenues of implementing new methods that minimize the impact of production processes on the environment.  The principal investigator and student researchers will visit Eastman Kodak facilities to become familiar with current industrial methods and to consult with industrial experts on various phases of the project. None of the research performed in this project will be proprietary.    By studying micelar catalysis in surfactant mixtures from a broader perspective than has been done previously, the proposed research will enable industries to implement this technology with minimum effort and expense.  Results of this project will provide the understanding necessary to bridge the gap between current fundamental knowledge of reaction kinetics and the actual application of this promising technology in industrial processes.",
