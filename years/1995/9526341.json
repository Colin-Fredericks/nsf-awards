However, there  are many uncertainty factors in the motor operations that can  significantly affect the motor incipient fault detection process  and which have not been addressed.  In this proposed project, the  Principal Investigators propose to extend the research to cover  more realistic operating environments.  The PIs will investigate  different factors such as varying load conditions, saturation  effects, temperature effects, noise effects, and their influences  on the process of motor incipient fault detection for three-phase  induction motors.  In addition, the PIs will investigate and  establish a general theory and principle for motor incipient  fault detection using a set theoretic formulation.  After setting  up the problem in set theoretic formulation, the challenges will  lie in the finding of the correct mappings from the appropriate  measurements to the estimation of the actual motor faults and  their severity.  The PIs will investigate and demonstrate the  advantages and feasibility of the use of neural network and fuzzy  logic technologies to obtain the motor fault mapping from  appropriate information to yield accurate motor incipient fault  detection in an non-invasive, economical, and reliably manner,  along with the ability to provide a qualitative and heuristic  explanation of the fault detection process.  ***",
