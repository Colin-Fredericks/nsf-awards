 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553361  Taylor  The University and Community College System of Nevada (UCCSN) will  develop an education and research tpaining program in the  environmental sciences that is integrated and system-wide, with an  emphasis on linking the disciplines of environmental chemistry,  environmental biology, ecology, and human health.  This  interdisciplinary area of emphasis within the environmental  sciences is an important initiative because the State of Nevada is  experiencing an unparalleled rate of population growth (5% per year  over the last four years), which is far in excess of all other  states.  In addition, the increases are confined to the urban  centers in Las Vegas (Clark County), Reno and Sparks (Washoe  County) and Carson City.  The net effect of this growth over the  last four decades has been to transform the state from a  predominantly rural to a largely urban environment.  The rate of  transformation is unprecedented, and the consequences for human  health and natural resources are just beginning to be recognized.    The current effort will stimulate the development of a cohesive  statewide program to address the relationship between quality of  the environment and the health of human populations and natural  resources in Nevada.  The program calls for the following:   (1) to  develop a system-wide infrastructure for graduate education and  training in the environmental sciences because none of the  UCCSN units have the depth and breadth to individually develop a  program of excellence; (2) to develop a research infrastructure to  encourage UCCSN faculty and graduate students to devote more  of their competitive research to the environmental sciences by  linking basic and mission-oriented research and emphasizing  priority problems in the state of Nevada; and (3) to develop a  training and networking infrastructure in Nevada to inform and  educate the population on issues in the environmental sciences,  focusing on linking the educational and research expertise in the  UCCSN with bus iness interests in the public and private sector.    These three platforms of the infrastructure will be implemented  through the Graduate Program of Environmental Sciences and Health  (ES&H) at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR); this program  is part of the Center for Environmental Sciences and Engineering  (CESE) at UNR.  The ES&H program will be aggressively expanded to  include faculty and graduate students from the University of  Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), leading to eventual full partnership.   This will be the first example of a system-wide degree and training  program within UCCSN and will serve as a template by which other  systemic graduate programs in the sciences and engineering can be  developed in the future.",
