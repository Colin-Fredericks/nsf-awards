Using carbon networks  in the form of fullerene  nanotubes and wires, this project aims to develop a new generation of  probes which connect the macroscopic to the nanoscopic world with  chemically specific, atomic precision.    Whereas x-ray diffraction and related techniques have long been the  basis of our detailed understanding of objects on this atomic length  scale, they only work with large numbers of identical copies of the  structure arranged in regular crystal lattices.  Since the invention  and early applications of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) it has  become increasingly clear that it is possible, at least in principle,  to break loose from this requirement of needing a crystalline array.  It should be possible to image, probe and manipulate individual  structures, one by one, on the nanometer scale.  Extensions of the  idea of STM to other proximate probes such as atomic force microscopy  (AFM), and magnetic force microscopy (MFM) have therefore become a  major scientific endeavor worldwide.    The common feature of all these methods is that they rely on a direct,  physical connection between the macroscopic and nanoscopic realms in  the form of a tiny \"tip\" which is scanned with sub-angstrom precision  by piezoelectric devices.  Most bulk materials are not chemically  stable when elongated into probes of width less than 10 nanometers.  However, carbon in the form of a graphine sheet is chemically stable  in the form of fullerene balls and tubes even when these are less that  1 nm in diameter.  This project is aimed at the general development of  fullerne tubes as the tips of proximate probes and manipulators.    Fullerene nanotubes will be produced both by currently known  techniques using carbon arcs and/or catalytic particles and by new  methods presently under development.  These involve production o f  single- and multi-walled nanotubes by laser vaporization of  carbon/metal catalyst composite targets in  a quartz tube furnace, and  controlled growth of mounted \"seed crystal\" nanotubes in high electric  fields.  Mounting techniques will be developed to attach individual  nanotubes to sharpened platinum electrodes with good electrical  contact and reliable mechanical, chemical stability.  Electrical and  mechanical  properties of the individually mounted nanotubes will be  measured, including their ability to serve as efficient antennas at  optical frequencies and their Q value when used as a nanoscopic  cantilever.  ***",
