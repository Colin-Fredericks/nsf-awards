 "awd_abstract_narration": "9420319  Feeny    Most  plant-feeding  insects have  specialized  preferences,  feeding  and laying their eggs on only a few plant  species.  They  find  their host plants largely by smell or  taste  of  chemical  compounds produced by the plant.  Different  plant  species attacked by the same insect often share one or  more  kinds  of  unusual chemical compounds, even  when  the  host  plants  themselves are not closely related to  one  another.  This  suggests that the ability of insects to add new  plant  species   to  their  diet  is  facilitated  by  the   shared  occurrence of compounds that the insects use for cues.   The  goal   of   this  research  is  to  find  out  how  chemical  similarities  and differences among plants  have  influenced  present-day associations between different plant species and  the  insects  that feed on them. The swallowtail butterflies  are  used  as  a model system in this research  since  their  evolutionary  relationships  and  larval  host  plants   are  especially  well  known.   The research  will  identify  the  mixtures of plant compounds used as egg-laying stimulants by  four  insect  species that differ greatly in  the  kinds  of  plants  they  attack.  The data will be  used  to  test  the  hypotheses  that plant selection by insects is triggered  by  relatively  fixed sensory responses to particular compounds,  and  that movements to new host species are unlikely  unless  those species produce the same compounds.  The results  will  provide  valuable insights into the degree to which  sensory  responses  by  insects to plant chemicals  are  conservative  rather  than  labile over evolutionary time.   Knowledge  of  both  the  cues insects currently use to locate host  plants  and  the frequency with which insects abandon those cues  to  take  advantage  of new hosts  has obvious implications  for  the  wise  deployment of new crop varieties  whose  chemical  profiles   have   been  or  can  be  modified   by   genetic  engineering.",
