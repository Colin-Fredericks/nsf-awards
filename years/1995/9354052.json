The collaborative is  addressing the weaknesses in the preparation of elementary,  middle, and secondary science and mathematics teachers by (1)  involving university and college science and mathematics  faculty, along with education faculty and teachers, in the  cooperative development of science and mathematics courses in  teacher preparation programs; (2) emphasizing teaching for  understanding and integrating content area and effective  instructional practices; (3) creating ten Professional  Development Schools which cooperate with the teacher  preparation programs - four elementary, two middle, and four  high school - with special emphasis on mathematics and  science, training mentor teachers in the enquiry, hands-on,  case study based approach being developed; and (4)  establishing seminars at schools for teachers and university  faculty to discuss problems in teaching effectively.  Other  emphases of the project are the recruitment of minority  students to teacher preparation programs, creation and  promotion of area business-academic-school partnership  programs in which both pre-service and in-service teachers  will participate in the application of mathematics and  science in business and industry and use this knowledge to  develop pedagogical materials for classroom use; and  coordination with major mathematics and science initiatives  in Boston and Cambridge.",
