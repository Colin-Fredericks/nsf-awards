 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal solicits funding to support a multi-state effort  to develop curricula and laboratory materials for student learning  in advanced skills technologies for fifteen occupational areas  supporting the American machining and machine tool industries.  The  Machine Tool Advanced Skills Technology Educational Resources  (MASTER) Program will design, develop, test and disseminate new  curricula materials for AS/AAS degree options in machining and  metals related technologies.  Since these occupational areas  generally require some form of apprenticeship or internship, these  educational materials will also be designed and prescribed for use  with industry partners.  The problems addressed by this project  are:  (1) the use of outdated curricula materials by schools and  colleges; (2) fewer students entering programs of study in these  career fields that are highly important to the nation's economy in  aerospace, metals, and manufacturing; (3) the rapid evolution of  new multi-task machine tools that have reached beyond the  capabilities of many existing technicians; and (4) the lack of  rigorous college level programs that are needed to prepare a target  audience of knowledge based workers in advanced problem solving  skills.  Four key goals will be addressed by the MASTER Program:   (1) to provide more technical graduates that are multi-skilled in  new machining tools and support related technologies; (2) to  upgrade curricula and laboratories in these technical fields which  are critical to the success of our nation; (3) to offer  college-level training to existing industry employees to become  multi-skilled with new and highly advanced equipment; (4) to  establish realistic opportunities for college and industrial  partners to validate competency requirements, prepare a national  model for apprenticeship/internship with prescribed laboratory work  experiences; and (5) to disseminate the new curricula and  educational materials nationally.  This collaborative effort brings  together  six of the nation's leading two-year colleges,  geographically dispersed, in areas of high demand, with identified  public school and industry partners.  Significant national outcomes  can be the survival of many critical industries and technical jobs.",
