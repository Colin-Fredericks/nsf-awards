 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to provide a detailed test of the ACT-R theory.  The ACT-R theory is a production system theory of human cognition that concerns itself with how cognitive problem solving skills (for example, algebra equation solving) are organized and acquired.  It is a computer simulation program which is capable of modeling in detail the steps of problem solving.  The experiments in this project will test three new aspects that augment the ACT-R theory.  These are: (1) a detailed theory of how people scan visual information and how this relates to higher-level processing; (2) a theory of how attentional limitations affect success in retrieving information needed to solve problems from memory; and (3) a theory of how new problem-solving skills are learned by analogy.    The ACT-R theory has played a major role in translating psychological research into educational applications.  For instance, computer-based tutors, which incorporate ACT-R models, have been developed for teaching mathematics.  While such applications are already successful in improving educational achievement they could be even more successful if they were based on a more detailed interpretation of student behavior.  The new theoretical developments that the present experiments will test provide the requisite level of detail in the ACT-R theory; the present research will determine the accuracy of these theoretical extensions.",
