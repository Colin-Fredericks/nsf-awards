 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central theme of this research is the development of a fuller  theoretical description of the behavior of memoryless-error-  function (or Bussgang) type blind equalization algorithms, in  particular CMA, as used in practice with finite-length, fractional  spacing, higher-order (non-constant modulus, non-uniformly  distributed) source constellations, (deterministic and stochastic)  correlated source time series, and modest channel noise.  The  initial target is the behavior of fractionally-spaced CMA with a  correlated (or periodic) source, which appears capable of causing  misbehavior in practice.  We plan to use analytical tools from  topologically based, algebraic-geometry (in particular Bernstein's  theorem, relaxation methods, and Morse theory) non typically  associated with the study of adaptive filters in addition to  averaging theory tools popular in adaptive systems analysis.  The  ultimate intent is to convert an expanded theory into situation  dependent design guidelines for stepsize, length, fractional-  spacing, initialization selection, and failure recovery tricks for  the use of CMA as a start-up scheme (with a subsequent switch to  decision-direction) for high data throughput applications.    We plan to translate our analytical advances on CMA to  fractionally-spaced realizations of other blind equalizer  algorithms of the memoryless error function class (including  refinements to CMA), for which actual operating data can be  obtained industrially as for CMA.  We also plan to use our behavior  insights into CMA to help provide fair comparisons on actual  operating data to competing schemes such as symbol-spaced decision  feedback equalizers and similar complexity algorithms based on  second-order correlation statistics of single-input, multiple-  output models of fractionally-spaced equalization.",
