 "awd_abstract_narration": "There have been numerous attempts to create laboratory exercises  that integrate the concepts of physical, analytical, organic, and  inorganic chemistry.   Most of this work concentrates on pre-  planned labs where the answer is known.   However, true chemical  research relies not only on the integration of the concepts, but  also on the ability to work on problems where the answer is not  known a priori and where working effectively within a team of  researchers is vital.   The objective of this project is the  continuing development of an integrated lab sequence which  incorporates concepts from organic, inorganic, physical, and  analytical chemistry into projects involving original research  ideas.   Students work in teams of four or five, each team  including both organic chemistry and physical chemistry lab  students.   Each student brings his or her particular skills and  background to the research group, and the resulting combination  of skills and personalities often results in novel and original  research.   Majors in chemistry take the integrated laboratory  sequence twice, as part of their organic chemistry and physical  chemistry lab courses.  Research that has already been performed  under the rubric of the integrated laboratory include  sonochemistry, synthesis of buckminsterfullerene, synthesis of  water-soluble polymeric dyes, and synthesis and testing of  conductive polymers.   Students are not only able to do better  research, they are also able to gain valuable experience in using  instrumentation they are likely to encounter in their  professional careers.   The integrated laboratory sequence  provides a means for students to obtain expertise in applying  their knowledge of chemistry to real-life problems.",
