State University  Title:  Conference on Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy II           2.  Abstract for the project.            This award will support a cross-disciplinary conference on statistics and astronomy.           In recent years, astronomers have shown considerable          interest in applying advanced statistical techniques such as          errors-in-variables regression models for measurement error          problems, survival analysis for surveys with nondetections, and          clustering algorithms for galaxy distri`utions.  Communication          between the two communities was elevated by the successful          cross-disciplinary conference organized by Babu and Feigelson in          August 1991, the first such meeting in the U.S.  Since then,          interest on methodological issues has grown among astronomers,          with nearly 200 papers published annually in the astronomical          literature on statistical issues.  The proposed conference will          feature lectures by distinguished statisticians on advanced          methods applicable to astronomical research.            The proposed conference seeks to bridge the gap between the          communities of astronomers and statisticians, exposing          researchers and students to issues of common interest.  The          sessions will begin with an invited lecture by a statistician          describing important new developments relevant to a class of          astronomical problems.  Applications and suggestions to tune the          methods for the needs of the astronomy community will be          discussed by astronomers.  Specific data analysis problems and          methods will then be addressed in contributed presentations.          There is considerable opportunity for young researchers in both          fields to pursue methodological problems encountered in modern          astronomy.",
