The objectives of the workshop are: (I) to bring  together experienced researchers who have done cross-linguistic  work on the development of the functions of morphosyntax in  narrative in order to compare findings across languages and  methodology across studies; (2) to enable less-experienced  researchers and students to work with these experts, to become  familiar with the current issues, learn the state-of-the-art  analysis techniques, and carry out summer-long collaborative  projects; (3) to facilitate the formation of new  interdisciplinary research collaborations which will extend  beyond the summer. In summary, the workshop will provide a  seminar setting for leaders, less-experienced researchers, and  students to compare their analyses across languages, with the  goal of testing and improving current theories of the acquisition  of lexical and grammatical devices used in narrative discourse.         The workshop will be led by Ruth Berman and Dan Slobin, and  will focus on children's gradual mastery of the uses of the  morphosyntax of their languages to convey complex narrative  information, primarily utilizing the 'frog story' elicitation  paradigm. The workshop will be open to all institute faculty,  affiliates and students; those interested in the cross-language  comparison of morphosyntax in aphasia and in developmental  language disorders will especially be encouraged to participate.",
