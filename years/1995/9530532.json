The SNDR is a multi-agency working group  that is part of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources  (CENR) of the National Science and Technology Council, which was  established by the President on November 23, 1993.  The SNDR  coordinates U.S. federal agency participation in the International  Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR).  The SNDR is made up  of 19 member agencies and departments, cooperating to increase the  overall effectiveness and productivity of U.S. Federal agency  programs for reducing deaths, injuries, and economic and social  disruptions resulting from natural disasters, such as the  devastating Northridge earthquake which struck the Los Angeles  region on January 17, 1994.  Lessons learned in the Northridge  earthquake are an important part of this document.  This grant is  a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***",
