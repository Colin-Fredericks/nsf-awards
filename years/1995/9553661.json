 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed project focuses on (a) bringing together a  coalition of educators, scientists, industrial partners, and  curriculum developers to establish a strategy for the TPAD  technician preparation program; (b) developing a curriculum to  provide \"hands-on\" enhancement opportunity to college instructors  in the area of biotechnology; (c) assessing the strategy on an  annual basis by the coalition together with outside expert advice  and input; and (d) collaborating with industry to develop the  required 2-year TPAD reagents and equipment.  At the commencement  of the project, the Coalition will meet to determine the most  effective strategy to initiate and address the project' s specific  goals and objectives previously outlined.       Undergraduate 2-year college faculty for the project will be  recruited locally for each of the summer workshops.  The emphasis  will be on the East and West Coasts, where the biotechnology  industry is concentrated and where the need for technicians is  greatest.       At the completion of summer workshops, the faculty  participants will complete a general evaluation and questionnaire.   The faculty practical implementation of experiments in technician  TPAD curriculum.  There will be a total of 102 faculty  participants, over a four-year period.       Other institutions which will participating in this project  include Seattle Central Community College, Cerritos College,  Northern New Mexico Community College, and Prince George's  Community College.",
