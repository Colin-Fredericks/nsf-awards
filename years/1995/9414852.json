 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF and the University of Alaska, Fairbanks are jointly funding a replacement structure, Elvey II,  for the Geophysical Institute.  NSF participation is focused on approximately 15% of the construction effort and will support facilities specifically for the Atmospheric Sciences and Remote Sensing Groups.  The existing facilities are extremely limited and fail to meet the technical requirements of today's complex research demands.     The Geophysical Institute was created in 1946 by Congress to conduct geophysical research concerning the Arctic, and it has evolved into one of a few institutions within the U.S. where scientific expertise covers the entire spectrum of geophysical disciplines -- from outer space to the earth's inner core.  It is the only high-latitude research and academic center in the country.  Research conducted at the Institute is important in this era of growing concern about the health and welfare of the planet, and research training is a significant component of the Institute's program.   Approximately one half of the funded effort will replace seven wet laboratories including facilities for study of Trace Gases, Climate, Solar Data, Aerosol, Atmospheric Chemistry and Optics.  The other half of the support will provide enhanced user services in the Geo Data Center.  Currently these labs and facilities are located in several buildings throughout the campus, and  space for the Atmospheric Sciences group is severely limited and lacks chemistry laboratories and specialized facilities.  It lacks adequate electrical and plumbing services, and a fume exhaust system for storage of hazardous chemicals. There is asbestos in the fire retardant systems, and the HVAC system is inadequate for heating, cooling and ventilation.    Fifteen faculty will be the direct beneficiaries of the replacement facilities, and approximately 65 graduate students enrolled in M.S. or Ph.D. programs will work in the new space.  One-third of the graduate students are women and minorities.  The Institute has a number of outreach activities including programs designed to interest elementary school students and Alaskan natives in the geosciences.",
