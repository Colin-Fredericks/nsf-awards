 "awd_abstract_narration": "Committed to ensuring the provision of high quality  mathematics and science education to all students in this  majority-Hispanic community, the El Paso Partnership for  Excellence in Teacher Preparation represents a major  deviation from the historic paradigm of teacher education.  The Partnership is an integral part of the El Paso  Collaborative for Academic Excellence and the El Paso Urban  Systemic Initiative and joins the Colleges of Science and  Education at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), the  El Paso Community College, and three major public school  districts in El Paso County in a fundamental transformation  of teacher preparation that is grounded in and contributes  to systemic reform in K-12 education.    The Partnership, which will be led by Arturo Pacheco, Dean  of UTEP's College of Education, and John R. Bristol, Interim  Dean of the College of Science, will sponsor activities  contributing to four major goals:  (1) to recruit more  students into mathematics and science teacher preparation,  particularly more minority students, and provide support and  financial incentives for those planning to become teachers;  (2) revise and enhance curriculum at both the lower- and  upper-division levels so that prospective teacher achieve  high levels of both content knowledge and pedagogical  skills; (3) to enhance the teaching skills of mathematics,  science, and teacher education faculty so that they can both  better impart content knowledge and model exemplary  pedagogical behaviors; and (4) to provide support for new  mathematics and science teachers as they enter their  profession.",
