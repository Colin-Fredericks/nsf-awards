 "awd_abstract_narration": "9523611  Ferguson   An integrated modeling methodology will be developed to help assess vegetation response to climate variability and climate change in complex terrain.  the chosen modeling domain includes the state of Oregon that represents linked regions of complex terrain.  In addition, the maritime influence in this domain allows successful dynamic modeling of climate and reasonably consistent statistical regression between climate parameters.  The spatial resolution of many currently available climate scenarios is too coarse for accurate ecological modeling in complex terrain.  The few high resolution climate scenarios of not have long enough time series for modeling transient responses of ecological processes.  Also, the effect of changes in climate variability is an important uncertainty in integrated assessments.  Therefore, significant effort will be devoted to developing very high resolution baseline climate scenarios and climate change scenarios that include changes in daily and interannual variability.     Available weather observations will be used to generate a spatially distributed data base that describes a current scenario of climate.  Daily climate will be simulated using a stochastic weather generator that will be modified to include relative humidity, wind, and maintain physical consistency between climate variables.  Changes in variability will be applies to the baseline climate database to develop a high resolution time series of potential change.   Three different simulated ecological responses will be tested.  One of the current climate, one from the time series reflecting only mean changes, and one from the time series reflecting mean and variance changes.  The integration of these physical components (scenario formation-physical impacts) fills a critical void in the full framework of integrative assessments.",
