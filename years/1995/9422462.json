 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mital   This is a follow-up workshop on the role of ergonomics and humans in the design for manufacture and the operation of advanced manufacturing technology systems.  The first workshop was held on November, 1993, at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio.  At that conference, a number of objectives were pursued, including the exploration of the role of humans in advanced manufacturing, the identification of research issues relevant to human performance and efficiency in a hybrid manufacturing systems, and the prioritization of research needs identified.  Another key objective was to use the results of the workshop to prepare a report which NSF can use as a guide to focus and prioritize on research funding needs in the area of design of hybrid manufacturing systems and design for manufacture.  The objective of the current workshop is to complete some unfinished work at the first meeting.  Specifically, the aim is to convert the research issues identified in the earlier workshop into specific problem statements that can be disseminated to researchers in the field.   The effective use of humans in the operations of high technology, high investment manufacturing systems is critical to maintaining the up times of such systems and consequently, improve their economic viability and competitiveness.  The workshop will help provide some insights on what the critical problems are in man-machine systems,  It will also provide a better understanding of  the research obstacles that must be overcome to see notable progress in the area.",
