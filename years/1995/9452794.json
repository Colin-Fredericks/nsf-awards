Gersmehl    A CD-ROM and associated software and data bases are being  developed for use in teaching geography of the United States  in secondary schools.  This project is based on a previously  funded NSF project, Activities and Readings in the Geography  of the United States (ARGUS), which is presented in a print  format.  The CD-ROM will have four key components:  photographic images that will bring selected aspects of the  world into the classroom for description and analysis; maps  and graphs that will summarize the geographic patterns of  phenomena and illustrate theories that geographers have  developed to explain those patterns; short animations that  will lead viewers around the images, maps, and graphs and  make transitions between them, for example by highlighting  an earthquake fault in a photograph or showing how data in a  table apply to a specific location on a map; simulations and  supporting data tables that will encourage and model active  exploration within the context of a problem situation.  The  materials are being developed in focused modules that can  become the basis of a course on geography or be used as  units in a number of courses.",
