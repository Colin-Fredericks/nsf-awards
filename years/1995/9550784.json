 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding supports the continued development of a program of  field-based instruction and undergraduate research on limnology  and Quaternary geology.   The new equipment increases the  university's ability to integrate hands-on activities and  research projects into introductory courses, the summer science  program for high school juniors, a planned outreach program for  area science teachers, and selected upper-level courses and  improves the opportunities for undergraduate research projects.    The most important use of the equipment is in introductory  courses, which expose the maximum number of students to geology  early in their academic careers.   The growing emphasis on field-  and research-based instruction in these courses has improved the  learning experience for students by engaging them in the process  of solving local geologic problems using data that they have  collected themselves.   Students learn about geologic materials  and the process of scientific investigation through a series of  interrelated exercises.   This introduction ultimately provides  students with a familiar reference with which to compare concepts  presented in class.",
