 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves comprehensive sedimentologic and isotope  geochemistry studies on Permian to Jurassic clastic and chemical  deposits of a freshwater rift lake from the Mid-Zambezi Basin, in  southern Gondwana.  The objective is to document Permian to  Jurassic climate changes from the sedimentary record and to compare  the climate data to those obtained from equivalent time-intervals  in Laurasia.  The research will provide crucial field data and  produce a realistic conceptual climate model for large continental  interiors against which numerical model simulations can be tested  and refined.  Provenance and depositional environments will be  determined from petrographic and microfabric studies of sandstones  and carbonates, respectively.  Distribution of primary clay mineral  assemblages will be determined on <2um sediment fractions and the  variation through time interpreted in terms of climate regimes for  depositional times.  6-18O will be measured on meteoric calcite  cements from strat-bound early-formed concretions in shales  throughout the sedimentary succession to establish changes in  isotopic composition of meteoric waters and to infer surface  paleotemperatures.  C-org signatures from laminated primary lake  carbonates will be used to assess organic productivity of the  ancient lake.    Interactive activities include:  teaching one upper level  undergraduate course on palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from  continental deposits, mentoring three students in undergraduate  geology research, and expanding contacts with middle-school science  teachers of the School District of Philadelphia, visiting and  demonstrating class activities in Earth and Environmental Sciences,  as well as guiding motivated individuals.",
