 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353414  Henry    This conference grant of $74,340 to the Florida Council of  Mathematics is designed to prepare 40 members of the Florida  Mathematics Presidential Awardee Association (FMPAA) to serve as  mathematics education reform leaders, and to conduct outreach  conferences, particularly for small school districts in Florida.    Over twenty months of the project, there will be a leadership  conference for FMPAA members followed by five regional conferences  with many of the Awardees as conference presenters.  The leadership  conference for the Awardees will be planned in spring and conducted  in summer, 1994.  During the 1994-95 school year, the grant will  provide support for the Awardees to serve as presenters in five  outreach conferences for teachers from small districts in Florida.   Each conference will be planned for an attendance of 75 teachers  from small districts with minimal mathematics education support for  a total of 375 teachers impacted by the pool of 40 teacher leaders  prepared.    The evaluation of the conference grant will be done by evaluating  the five outreach conferences conducted, the dissemination of  examples of best practice through the outreach conferences, and the  monitoring of small district networking activities resulting from  each conference.",
