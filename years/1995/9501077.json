The goal of this  research project is to elucidate the dynamical mechanisms that underlie such  spatio-temporal behavior by using a qtandard mathematical tool, sometimes   called Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) analysis. In addition it is planned to apply some   of the methods used so successfully for chaotic time series data to spatio-  temporal data. By using K-L analysis to find an approximate low dimensional   model of some of the spatio-temporal behavior, methods that have been   developed for chaotic time series data may be applicable to spatially  extended data.  In addition, it is planned to investigate control strategies for   spatio-temporally chaotic dynamics by developing appropriate control  mechanisms for suitable low-dimensional approximations.        The apparent spatial coherence of many large-scale systems with  complex dynamics implies that the underlying behavior can be described  mathematically with relatively few degrees of freedom. The goal of this  research project is to elucidate the dynamical mechanisms that underlie such  spatio-temporal behavior.  Examples currently under investigation include the  analysis of the onset of turbulence in 2-dimensional fluid flow and the  analysis of the dynamics of cellular flames that is complicated in space and  time.  This study is intended to characterize the spatio-temporally complex   motion of  the flame cells in order to develop a phenomenological model as a  prerequisite for systematically controlling the behavior of such cellular  flames. The long term potential of this research is considerable. The  experiments on flames are typical of many spatio-temporally complex  problems.  As a result of this research, fundamental mathematical insights  into the processes that generate and drive spatio-temporal structures are  expe cted. Such insight is a prerequisite for any advanced technological use  of nonlinear dynamics, for example, to control combustion processes or to  suppress and control boundary layer turbulence along airfoils.  ***",
