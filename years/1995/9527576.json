The overall goal of this effort is to demonstrate a methodology for sensor-integrated control of rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) of polycrystalline silicon (poly Si) from silane with focus on controlling deposition thickness and across-wafer uniformity.  The project exploits advances in real-time sensors, including pyrometry for temperature, thermal imaging for temperature uniformity, and sampling mass spectrometry for thickness metrology and process ambient monitoring.  Reduced-order process models constructed from high fidelity heat and fluid flow simulations, together with physically-based dynamic equipment, process, and sensor simulations, are the basis for control models.  Resulting run-to-run control methodologies for controlling deposition thickness and across-wafer uniformity are being developed and validated experimentally, and real-time control approaches are being explored.  These run-to-run control approaches will be extendible to real-time c ontrol.  An architecture to support a basic supervisory control component is being demonstrated, using physically-based dynamic simulation to determine sensor signatures of specific equipment failure modes, together with advanced algorithms as interference tools for detecting sensor signal correlations and identifying indicated equipment/process malfunction.  The investigators at the University of Maryland provide the effort on simulation and control, while the investigators at North Carolina State University provide the effort on sensors and on rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition of polycrystalline silicon.  The experimental proof of concept of the control system will be performed in the cluster tool deposition apparatus at North Carolina State University. ***    0  0                                                      Oh     +'  0                                       $       H       l                                               D       h                                               ,   \\\\CLM15\\SMURPHY$\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT       S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               9527576                             SHERONDA MURPHY                     SHERONDA MURPHY             @     X  g                          @                                   @     X  g                                                                                                  @                                           Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      2                                                                                        ;         e =       e               d                       d                                       l       l   l       l       l       l       l                                                                           1                                                                                               %   D                           T   G   9                           l                                                                                         l       l                                                                       l               l                                                       l       l       l       l                           s                                                                                                 9527576 Krishnaprasad  This award is the University of Maryland with a sub-contract to North Carolina State University at Raleigh.
