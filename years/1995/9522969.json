Ira Kaufman, Greg Guroff, and Murray Feshbach,  under the aegis of Legacy International of Alexandria, VA, the  Center for Post-Soviet Studies, and the Center for Russian  Environment Policy.  To assess Russia's influence on global  economic change requires researchers and policymakers to have  greater access to the Russian Federation's vast scientific  resources and information.  Likewise, government agencies,  international organizations, corporations, and Russian citizens  require the appropriate data to address the current environment  and health crisis, as well as the impact of future development.   The recent completion of the first \"Environment and Health Atlas  of Russia\" is a first step to presenting the wealth of Russian  data.  To integrate the atlas and other information with global  change initiatives, a repository for Russian environment and  health data sets needs to be standardized, digitalized, updated,  and translated to a format for policy makers.  The goal is to  outline a strategy for establishing a Russian electronic databank  for environment and health.  The workshop will fulfill this goal  by (1) examining existing Russian data initiatives and assess  future data needs for environment and health in Russia; (2)  presenting several options for applying information technology to  meet Russian data needs; (3) recommending the infrastructure and  standards necessary for the proposed databank; and (4) generating  new proposal ideas to address global change issues using current  data.  Delegations from government, private sector, non-  government organizations, and universities from the U.S. and  Russia will participate.  The group will address the  possibilities and difficulties to be encountered in creati ng a  Russian databank, as well as integration of the databank with  relevant international programs.  Participants will recommend  follow-up databank proposals, the submission of which, workshop  organizers will coordinate.    This project in geography and regional science fulfills the  program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling  leading experts in Russia and the United States to combine  complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong  mutual interest and competence.  ***",
