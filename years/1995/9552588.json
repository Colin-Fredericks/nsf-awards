The current proposal seeks funds for a second conference, the Next  Step Institute '95.  Seventy teams of 4 members each, will be  accepted for a three and one half day institute.  Teams will be  selected from across the nation, and will all be members of The  Association of Science Materials Centers (ASMC).  The Institute  will have two major components the first for districts and  consortia, already involved in systemic support for science  education, who need to upgrade their skills and keep current with  the latest reform efforts.  Participants in this component will  attend two keynote presentations, four specialized strands which  will allow different team members to participate more fully in a  focused topic such as; Sharing the Vision, Nuts and Bolts,  Assessment and Standards, Professional Growth and Team Building.   In addition time will be set aside for cross strand highlights  during which participants will be able to share information in  order to learn about presentations they have not attended and time  for team planning.  The second component of the Institute will be  to produce a long term plan and a proposal based on a needs  assessment from data gathered from both the First and Next Step  conferences.  The request is for $84,568 with cost share estimated as $105,250.",
