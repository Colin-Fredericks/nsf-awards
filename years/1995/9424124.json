 "awd_abstract_narration": "9424124  Hyde  A program of summer graduate research will be carried out by the  Physics Department at Baylor University.  This will supplement a  very successful, but modest, program in place at Baylor during  the past summer.  Seven students will be identified for the  program by applications targeted at smaller undergraduate  institutions which have little, if any, undergraduate research  opportunities available on their campuses.  Historically  predominantly Black and Hispanic campuses will also be  particularly targeted as will predominantly minority junior  colleges.  The other campuses will be both nationally and  regionally selected, including all such Texas, Louisiana,  Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arkansas schools.  These include many  institutions with large Hispanic enrollments.  The students will  participate with Baylor Students and students from several  foreign countries in cross cultural experiences in addition to  weekly seminars, an end of summer Undergraduate Research  Symposium, as well as specially designed classes in various  physics research fields of interest.  Trips to nearby industries  and research institutions will be organized.  This research is  expected to lead to journal publications.  ***",
