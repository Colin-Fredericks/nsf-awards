Staddon,  IBN 94-20646, Reinforcement  Mechanisms           One of the most basic, enduring goals of behavioral  science is to understand how reward and punishment affect  behavior and what these effects tell us about the basic  mechanisms of learning.  In this research project, Dr.  Staddon will investigate three aspects of this problem: the  effects of reward on choice, the processes by which patterns  of reward affect behavior, and the processes that produce  novel or creative behavior.       The studies of choice will address the fact that  choices are affected by both recent and remote events as  well as by correlations between responses and rewards.  Experiments will be carried out to disentangle these three  variables and their effects on choice responses.       Organisms also react immediately and proportionately to  sudden changes in the time interval between rewards.  These  fast-acting processes allow organisms to track the intervals  between successive rewards and react immediately to changes  in the temporal patterning of rewards.  A series of  experiments will examine the dynamics of these timing  effects.       An act must occur before it can be modified by reward  or punishment.  This raises the question,  How do novel  behaviors occur?   A third series of experiments will use  the vocal behavior of budgerigars to study is process.  Previous research has shown that budgerigars can easily  learn to emit specific vocal names in the presence of  different visual stimuli and will then spontaneously emit  the name of a to-be-chosen stimulus during a choice task  even if this is not required by the experimental procedures.  By selectively rewarding rare vocalizations, it has been  possible to expand this repertoire.  A series of experiments  will be carried out to explore the role of this novel vocal  behavior in the learning of complex tasks.  This research  should help us understand the processes that produce new  behaviors and may further our un derstanding of the role of  speech in cognition and learning.",
