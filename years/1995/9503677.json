 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of plasma physics is common to both laboratory  experimentalists and space experimentalists; yet the interchange  between these two groups is frequent.  We are organizing a third  workshop for these two communities to discuss experiment,  simulations, and theory of common interest, to be held in  Pitlochry, Scotland, July 24-28, 1995.    The subjects chosen will emphasize areas where progress is being  made both in the laboratory and space.  The include topics such as:   Critical Velocity, Reconnection, Ion Cyclotron Waves, Beam Drive  Instabilities, Anomalous Resistivity, Double Layers, Collisionless  Shocks, Nonlinear and Kinetic Alfven Waves, Active Space  Experiments, Turbulence and Transport.    The need for these two communities to interact more closely has  already been recognized by the AGU which held sessions on this  subject at AGU meetings.  We also held a successful meeting in  Alpbach, Austria July 1-6, 1991, and in Banff, Canada, June 21-25,  1993.  We expect that the attendees will be primarily specialists  from the laboratory and space communities.  Some advanced graduate  students will also attend.",
