 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528759  Melnyk   This research is focused on the development and evaluation of a new process for integrating environmentally conscious manufacturing (ECM) concerns and issues into the design of new products/processes and the planning and scheduling of production, not only within the factory of a single firm, but also within the product supply chain.  Integration of the supply chain implies bringing in the issues, activities,  and actions of the suppliers into the planning and scheduling process. The project will integrate parts of this process into an existing material requirements planning (MRP) system to create a \"Green MRP\" system. The objectives of the research are: (1) develop a working prototype of an ECM product design/manufacturing system  (PDMS), (2) examine the process of incorporating Green MRP into an existing MRP system, (3) explore new options with different production plans, including recycling, (4) provide accounting reports, feedback, and support for environmental compliance, (5) develop a working system for incorporating the supply chain into the ECM system, and (6) develop implementation guidelines and procedures  to follow when incorporating environmental concerns into the PDMS. The research methodology includes qualitative techniques, such as interviews, verbal protocol analysis, and content analysis and quantitative analysis methods, including computer simulation, data recording, fuzzy set theory, bills of waste, by-product processing, waste streaming, and network theory. An interdisciplinary advisory  and review team from both academia and industry will be convened to support the overall research.   In today's competitive market, firms are under pressure to develop and introduce new products quickly and at lower costs while meeting or exceeding environmental requirements. Countries are investigating ways to come up with legislation that would hold manufacturers directly responsible for the entire life cycle of the products they manufacture. This research through its devel opment of the PDMS and Green MRP can help a manufacturer by (1) identifying potential problems in advance; (2) improving waste management planning; (3) improving the ability of a manufacturer to ensure compliance; (4) generating the formal documentation required for government regulations; and (5) improving the ability of designers and planners to understand the link between their decisions and the outcome to the environment.",
