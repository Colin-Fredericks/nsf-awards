 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stark Technical College (STC) proposes an Advanced  Technological Education project in Environmental Technology which  will result in the development of an Environmental Technology  option within Civil Engineering Technology. The project will  address northeastern Ohio's business and industry needs for  technical expertise in environmental instrumentation, regulation  and compliance areas as well as waste minimization/pollution  prevention concepts. This need is critical due to the heavy  concentration of manufacturing in the region and the fact that  northeastern Ohio is the most polluted quadrant of the state. The  College's established ties with business and industry in the region  will facilitate the design of a program that will produce uniquely  qualified graduates who can help the public and private sectors  address growing environmental regulations and concerns. The AAS  degree curriculum will be tied into secondary Tech Prep programs in  the region and related bachelor's degree programs at Youngstown  State University and the University of Findlay. An integral part of  the curriculum will be advanced communications technologies which  will enable students (high school, two-year college and university)  to communicate with each other on collaborative projects. It also  will serve as the basis for an Environmental Resource Center (ERC),  to be operated by students, which will facilitate and enhance  instruction, as well as respond to business/industry and community  questions and concerns. A major component of the project will be  Summer Institutes and academic year follow-ups for teacher/faculty  enhancement in several key areas:  pedagogy; technical expertise;  and math, science and communications-related instruction.",
