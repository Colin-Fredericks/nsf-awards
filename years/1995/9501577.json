The proposed research is a step toward the systematic  construction of intelligent agents that can reason and act  in a changing world.  These \"cognitive robots\" should be  able, among other things, to (1) observe other objects  changing their attributes and performing actions, and (2)  use their observations and their knowledge to reason about  the future and the past, to make or revise plans to achieve  goals and execute the generated plans.  The approach here is  to develop (1) an action specification language that can  express actual and hypothetical situations, concurrent  actions, actions with complex effects, constraints,  triggers, mapping between actual situation line and actual  time line; (2) executable logic programs that embody the  specifications; (3) interpreters for extension of the logic  programs; and (4) the cognitive robots themselves.    During the period of the grant, an educational plan will be  developed that exposes students to the insights,  perspectives, and tools of AI by (1) educating  undergraduates about AI's basic methods and concepts and  about AI's philosophical, social, and cognitive  consequences, and (2) educating graduate students in other  fields about the AI techniques and tools applicable to their  fields. Intelligent robots, which have a great attraction to  students and enable them to focus on some of the important  topics of AI, will be used in some of the courses to be  developed.",
