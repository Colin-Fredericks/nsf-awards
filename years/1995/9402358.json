Damping is usually measured  on soil samples tested in the  laboratory, but the effect of the disturbance on the soil  properties when the sample is removed from the ground is  uncertain.  Moreover, the frequencies used in the laboratory  tests are usually much higher than those of interest in  earthquake engineering.  An alternative approach is to use  field tests to measure the damping ratio in situ.   However,  despite the advantages of in situ tests, there have been  relatively few field attenuation measurements reported.    One of the objectives of this project is to develop and  implement an insitu test procedure for damping measurements  using surface waves.  Surface wave measurements offer  several advantages compared to crosshole and downhole  techniques, one being that they are non-invasive. Another  objective is to understand better the causes of the  frequently-observed differences in the damping values  between laboratory and in situ measurements.    The project involves three tasks:    1. To acquire surface wave attenuation data at sites within  the Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina, using  several different types of input motion (swept-sine, random,  and transient) to determine which one provides, for example,  the best signal-to-noise ratio.  Attenuation data will also  be recorded at several different source-receiver  combinations to evaluate the influence of near-field waves.    2. To develop and evaluate algorithms for: (i) estimating  particle motion amplitude spectra, (ii) calculating  attenuation parameters from observed surface wave  amplitudes, and (iii) inverting attenuation data to obtain  damping ratio.  Throughout this task, emphasis will be  placed on quantifying the uncertainties involved in each  step, with the aim of establishing not only the most likely  value of damping , but also the possible range of values.    3. Once appropriate field procedures and analysis methods  have been developed as part of Tasks 1 and 2, and  in order  to compare surface wave damping values with values obtained  from in situ borehole methods and laboratory tests, to  perform surface wave measurements of attenuation at the  Treasure Island National Geotechnical Experimentation Site  in San Francisco Bay, and at one or more sites in the Los  Angeles area affected by the Northridge earthquake.  ***",
