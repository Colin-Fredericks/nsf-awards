 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds a new networked multimedia computer and  audiovisual equipment for use by undergraduates in order to link  and reform the undergraduate component in two independent  language research labs.   This new equipment involves high-end  satellite work stations with CD-ROM and multimedia capacities in  each lab, to be centralized in one new interdisciplinary  Cognitive Studies undergraduate research laboratory/computer  room.   The project assists labs in developing innovative methods  of involving undergraduates in hands-on scientific  (hypothesis-testing) lab experiences that they can integrate with  the theoretical study of linguistics.   A larger number of  undergraduates can be integrated in a sustained research  experience, providing a model formal mechanism through the  university's recently established Cognitive Studies program for  undergraduate interaction and sharing of resources across labs.    In addition, the project introduces and integrates a third  research group, Adult Second Language Acquisition.   Several new  courses are being planned on the basis of the new lab  improvement.   Demonstration materials regarding language  knowledge and organization, including multimedia learning  modules, available on-line, are being developed and integrated in  new and existing courses.",
