 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate fault injection techniques  for the evaluation and validation of dependable protocols.  The project will  focus on techniques that can be used to  demonstrate three aspects of a target  protocol: (i) detection  of design or implementation errors, (ii) identification of  violations of protocol specifications, and (iii) insight into  design decisions  made by the implementors.    The end goal of the project is the investigation of  techniques for testing the fault-tolerance capabilities of  dependable protocols  and the development of a tool for the  experimental evaluation of commercial and  prototype  protocols.  The approach will center around a  technique  called`script-driven probing and fault injection.`  A distributed protocol can  be  viewed as an abstraction through which a collection of  participants  communicate by exchanging a set of messages.  Hence, no distinction is made  between application-level  protocols, communication protocols, or device layer  protocols.  A probe/fault injection (PFI) layer is inserted  below a target  protocol to filter and to manipulate the  messages  that are exchanged between  participants.  The fault  injection layer supports the execution of  deterministic or  randomly-generated test scripts to probe the participants  and  inject various faults into the system.  In particular,  by intercepting messages  between two layers in a protocol  stack, the fault injection layer can delay,  drop, reorder,  duplicate, and modify messages. Furthermore, it can  introduce  spontaneous messages into the system to probe  the participants and to  orchestrate the system execution  into a particular path.  Since timing  constraints are often  an important component of the dependability requirements  on  a system, the intrusiveness of a fault injection mechanism  on a target  system is a key issue which will be addressed by  this research.    The  educational component of this CAREER project will  include `undergraduate  mentoring` and `learning via  experimentation.`  Mentoring exposes students to  one-on-one  technical interactions with instructors and more senior  students.  Learning via experimentation has a two pronged  effect.  It allows students to  `practice` how to apply  knowledge and to`learn` how to obtain new information.  These  two aspects of the plan will be formalized into the  curriculum with  the  following educational activities:  (1)  Refocus the Undergraduate  Directed Study  to involve junior  and senior-level students in some of the  ongoing  prototyping activities in research projects and in various  laboratories  on  campus;  (2) Develop a curriculum track that emphasizes  experimentation to  enhance  learning of software systems concepts.",
