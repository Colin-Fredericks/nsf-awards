 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the Chemistry Department is upgrading a 21-  year-old 30-Mhz NMR spectrometer, which had been inoperable, with  state-of-the-art 200-MHz FT-NMR capabilities.   This new  instrument provides the ability to perform significant  undergraduate research projects, while being simple enough to  allow upper-division (e.g., sophomore-level and up) students to  record their own spectra routinely for instructional  laboratories.  The exposure of students to this instrument begins  in Organic Chemistry, the normal sophomore-level course, where  they record the spectra for the products synthesized during the  first-semester lab course.   During the second-semester lab,  open-ended project-based experiments are performed.   Without a  functional NMR spectrometer, the incorporation of this type of  experiment is extremely difficult.    The upper-division courses  all, with the current exception of Physical Chemistry,  incorporate advanced NMR techniques in their laboratory  offerings.   The most notable is the ability to offer a  meaningful lab component to a newly introduced Spectroscopy  class.  Undergraduate research is enjoying an immediate elevation  in opportunities with the presence of an FT NMR spectrometer.    Two of the faculty on staff are increasing their activity in  research as a result of increased demand.   Their projects  require NMR capabilities, ranging from routine 1H to 31P.   The  spectrometer meets both the current requirements, as well as the  foreseeable future needs.",
