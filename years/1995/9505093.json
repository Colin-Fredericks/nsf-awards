Work to be performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean and its impact on global change.  The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean- atmosphere-ice processes that demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate, including its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the interpre tation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model input, model validation and climate monitoring.     This award to the University of Washington establishes a Science Project Office for the SHEBA Program.  The Office will coordidate the planning activities, data collection, and serve as the primary point of contact for the project.  The data generated by all of the Phase 1 investigators will be transmitted to the Office and made available to other investigators so that the planning effort for the field program will be efficiently conducted with the most recent data set available.  ??",
