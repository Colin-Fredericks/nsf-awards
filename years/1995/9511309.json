The goal of  this  project  is  to examine how an important component  of  the  hippocampus,  the  CA3 region, might process,  store  and  recall  specific  patterns of information. A computational model  of  the  CA3  neural  network  will be used to test  hypotheses.  Specific  parameters regarding the firing properties of inhibitory  neurons  and  certain  aspects of synaptic transmission will  be  obtained  using  state-of-the-art  electrophysiological  recording  methods  from  neurons  in hippocampal slices. The computer  network  will  contain 1,000 to 10,0000 neurons based on published data and  the  experimental data from inhibitory neurons. A key feature  of  the  network  will  be  that excitatory connections between  pyramidal  neurons will potentiate or depress based on biophysical rules for  synaptic  potentiation and depression. The CA3  network  will  be  trained  with different patterns of input to test the  following:  1)  can  the network can discriminate between input patterns,  2)  can the network complete partially presented patterns, and 2)  is  information  distributed across the network. This  work  will  be  important  for  our  understanding of  how  this  region  of  the  hippocampus is involved in associative information storage.",
