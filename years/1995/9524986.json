 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Chemistry Division supports research by Dr. James M.   Tanko of the Chemistry Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and   State University, on the use of supercritical fluids as environmentally   benign solvents for chemical reactions.  The award is made in the   Technology for a Sustainable Environment activity of the 1995 NSF/EPA   Partnership for Environmental Research.  Carbon dioxide and fluoroform   will be examined for their potential as solvents for radical reactions.    Both solvents are expected to be inert toward free radicals and are known   to become supercritical at moderate temperatures and pressures.  The   goals of the project are to identify the scope and limitations of radical   reactions amenable to supercritical fluid conditions, to develop new   synthetic methods for the synthesis of high-value organic materials, and   to explore the implications of the use of supercritical fluids for   fundamental physical principles of organic reactivity.  Many organic reactions proceed by a mechanism which involves a reactive   species with an unpaired electron called a free radical.  Example   reactions are those involving addition of chlorine or bromine to   hydrocarbons or lengthening of hydrocarbon chains.   In these reactions,   it is important that the solvent not react with the free radical.  Often   the solvent also plays a role in the formation of the radical species.     In many cases benzene and carbon tetrachloride are effective solvents for   such reactions, but they are environmentally harmful.   In this research   two alternate solvents which are environmentally benign will be tested   for suitability in organic reactions involving free radicals.",
