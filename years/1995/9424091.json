The  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. David A. Berrigan to work with Dr. Ary A.  Hoffmann at La Trobe University in Australia.    Acclimation is an important physiological adaptation to  environmental variability, which occurs in response to a  variety of environmental stresses such as temperature,  desiccation and salinity.  Dr. Berrigan proposes three  approaches to assess the distribution of acclimation  responses and to measure their costs and benefits.  First,  he will survey a number of Australian fruit flies, (species  Drosophila) for acclimation responses to heat and cold.  Second, he plans to estimate the cost of acclimation to heat  or cold using a combination of life history and  physiological assays.  Third, he will experimentally  distinguish between injury from exposure to temperature  extremes and the costs of acclimation using comparative  studies of species with and without acclimation responses.  The goal is to use these measurements to develop models for  the evolution of acclimation responses to temperature. ***",
