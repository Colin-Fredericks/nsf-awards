 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to engage undergraduate faculty in a set of  activities that will prepare them to teach courses or course  modules on ethical and professional issues in computing.  Twenty-five undergraduate faculty from a diversity of disciplines  and types of institutions are participants. They are required to do  pre-workshop assignments; attend a 5-day workshop during the  summer, participate in an on-line forum, and attend a two day  follow-up meeting in February. The activities are designed to  address pedagogical issues as well as subject matter. The subject  matter topics to be covered include proprietary rights in computer  software, privacy, responsibility and liability, hacking, risk and  reliability, democracy, access, and autonomy, and professional  ethics for computer professionals. The project responds to the  growing need for faculty trained in this area as the accreditation  requirements in computer science and engineering recommend coverage  of \"social, ethical, and professional issues in computing.\"",
