There are  five major components to the facility: an ultraviolet  photolithography laboratory; a device processing laboratory  consisting of a reactive ion etcher, thermal evaporator, and  sputtering system; a materials preparation section with tools  for sawing and polishing; a display cell fabrication  laboratory; and a device and materials characterization  laboratory for electrical and thermal measurements. Three core  programs in optical materials share the infrastructure needs  and research interests. One program will use the facility for  fabrication and electrical characterization of semiconductor  structures of reduced dimensionality  with applications in  linear and nonlinear optics. A second program studies organic  and polymeric nonlinear optical materials, and requires the  facility for characterization of the glass transition in  optical polymers as well as for fabrication of devices and  substrates. A third program emphasizes optical studies of  liquid crystals and complex fluids, and requires the display  fabrication and characterization facilities. The  instrumentation will be housed in central facilities and will  be available to other researchers both on-campus and at  collaborating institutions.  %%%  The shared equipment facility will benefit three major programs  which form the core of an optical materials concentration  within the department. These programs, studying semiconductor  materials of reduced dimensionality, liquid crystals, and  polymeric materials,  encompass materials with important  applications in linear and nonlinear optical devices.  ***",
