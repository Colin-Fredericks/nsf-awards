 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethical Issues in Physics: Survey, Workshop, and Text Development.  Concern on the part of some physicists regarding ethical issues in physics is amply demonstrated through articles in various publications directed toward physicists, sessions organized by the Forum on Physics and Society at American Physical Society meetings, and discussions during the recent Ethical Issues in Physics Workshop held at Eastern Michigan University.  In this project, the PIs propose to survey members of the physics academic community to determine which universities are most interested in incorporating ethical issues into their physics curricula and what topics they would be most interested in seeing in an ethics text.  Another survey of physicists in industrial and governmental labs will seek to determine what formal training in ethical issues would be beneficial to students whose careers take them in that direction.  A second workshop will be held to extend the recently distributed Ethical Issues In Physics Workshop Proceedings to produce a text suitable for a one term, one hour per week seminar course for advanced undergraduates and graduate students majoring in physics.  This text would be placed in the public domain to encourage as wide a usage as possible.",
