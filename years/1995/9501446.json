 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501446   This research is focused on the issue of building an industry-university partnership to support the development of new algorithms and methods for real-time decision making in logistics.  In a typical logistics system, there is a regular need for real-time decision making in vehicle routing, scheduling of vessels, management of vehicle inventories, and design of service offerings using constantly changing information.  New technologies such as the combination of satellites with high-speed data networks are making real-time data available to decision makers.  These new technologies have motivated the development of new stochastic, dynamic models for more accurate decision making.  This research presents a set of models for problems ranging from real-time vehicle routing to dynamic service network design.  A common mathematical foundation is presented that focuses on stochastic optimization and dynamic network modeling.  New decision models will be developed subject to various sources of randomness in demand level, travel times, service breakdowns, and resource availability.  The use of graphical visualization for validating models and communicating results to model users will be pursued.  The establishment of an industry-university partnership is not only to support the research and advise on the relevancy of the models to be developed but also to influence the educational curriculum in logistics.      Establishing a strong industry-university partnership in research and education requires a substantial effort in reforming the curriculum.  The goals of the educational component of this work are:   (1) to increase industry participation in university education, (2) develop new training programs for industry partners, (3) develop a laboratory for computational logistics, (4) increase internship and co-op opportunities for students in the logistics industry, and (5) improve the technical skills of students in modeling and solving problems in the field of logistics.  The impact of the resear ch to stu  dents and industrial workers will be significant.  The research has direct industrial application and if successful, will improve the economic competitiveness of the logistics and distribution industries.",
