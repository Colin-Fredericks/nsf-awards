 "awd_abstract_narration": "9506262  Straus    The goal of Dr. Straus' work is to understand how totipotency, the  ability to undergo embryogenesis, is restricted to a specific  subset of embryonic cells in Volvox carteri. Volvox is ideal for  dissecting the mechanisms underlying the regulation of totipotency  because it is composed of only two cell types: germ line and  somatic. Furthermore, the entire pathway that determines cell fate  is accessible to genetic and biochemical analysis. Volvox  individuals have about 16 germ line cells that are specialized to  undergo embryogenesis and about 2,000 somatic cells that provide  motility and never divide. During embryogenesis, a single large  germ line cell undergoes rapid cleavage divisions to form a 2,000  celled embryo. The embryonic blastomeres then differentiate in a  reproducible lineage dependent manner into somatic cells and germ  line cells. The specialized somatic and germ line phenotypes are  ultimately due to the differential expression of cell type specific  gene sets. Dr. Straus' laboratory is cloning a gene, regA, that is  needed for correct cell type specific gene expression and cell fate  determination. In regA minus mutants somatic cells ectopically  express the gene set that normally is confined to the germ line in  addition to expressing the normal somatic cell repertoire. The  somatic cells of these mutants redifferentiate into totipotent germ  line cells. During the previous funding period Dr. Straus localized  the regA gene to a small chromosomal region using Targeted RFLP  Subtraction, a powerful and general method he developed for  isolating genes defined by mutations. He proposes to complete the  physical characterization of the regA locus and to isolate the gene  from the region. Cloning the gene will allow him to investigate the  role of regA in limiting totipotency and to learn how the processes  of cell fate determination and cell differentiation are integrated  in Volvox.  ***",
