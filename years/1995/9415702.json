 "awd_abstract_narration": "William Steele from Pennsylvania State University is supported by a grant   from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his   computer simulation studies of many body dynamics in liquids.  The goal   of the proposed research is to gain an improved understanding of the   relation between molecular interaction laws and the time-dependent   correlations that determine these macroscopic properties.  Steele hopes   to develop predictive techniques for the calculation of these observables   for dense fluids from molecular properties.  Steel will use computer   simulation to calculate time correlation functions which he then proposes   to analyze for 2, 3 and 4 body correlations.  Much of the successful research in the theory of liquids has been   concerned with calculations of equilibrium thermodynamic properties that   are dependent upon the interaction energies and distributions of pairs of   molecules in the fluid.  It is now generally believed that the   combination of computer simulation and theory has produced a satisfactory   solution to this problem, so that current research in this particular   area is devoted more to improvements in quantitative accuracy rather than   development of new theoretical approaches.  The dynamical properties of   dense fluids and their associated time correlation functions are much   less well understood.  A great deal remains to be learned about the   molecular basis for the behavior of time correlation functions in dense   fluids.  Steele's research addresses the calculation of the transport and   spectral characteristics of molecules from first principles based on   interaction potentials.  This research could have a significant impact on   furthering our understanding of the physical properties of dense fluids",
