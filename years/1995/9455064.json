 "awd_abstract_narration": "Though lasers have revolutionized research in optics and many other  fields of science, obstacles of cost and complexity have for the  most part kept them out of the undergraduate curriculum and  laboratories.  The goal of this project is the operation of a  workshop which will empower physicists and chemist to use exciting  new possibilities with diode lasers to bring demonstrations and  research opportunities before students.  To accomplish this,  attendees at a week-long workshop will have direct, hands-on  experience with a suite of diode-laser experiments, and will  receive seminar-format instruction in diode-laser competencies for  replication and operation of such experiments.  They will also  become part of a follow-up support community intended to help them  surmount obstacles in their own laboratories.  The workshop will be  of interest to physicists, and also chemical physicists, who want  to bring modern tunable-laser methods into the hands of students in  courses on optics, electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics,  and associated laboratory courses.",
