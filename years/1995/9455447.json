 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer-Integrated Introductory Biology Lab (CIBL) project  is a four-year development effort to combine an innovative format  for undergraduate biology laboratories with a thematic,  cross-curricular approach to content instruction that integrates  biology, physics, chemistry, atmospheric sciences, and  mathematics. The CIBL laboratory supports and extends hands-on  \"wet\" laboratory experiences using computer-based multimedia  (interactive video, graphics, animation, sound and computer  simulation), while the thematic, interdisciplinary approach to  the curriculum unifies the enormous diversity of scientific  content. This effort transforms Biology 5L, the large  introductory biology class taken by virtually all life-science  majors attending UCLA (currently over 800 per year) from a  \"barrier course\" to a \"facilitator course\" as part of a larger  effort at UCLA to recruit and retain student enrollment in  science, especially within minority groups whose members are  under represented in scientific careers. The project develops and  will publish eight laboratory modules (in addition to two  currently under development through a pilot grant from the Hughes  Foundation), and will serve as a model for change in other large  introductory science courses across the country.  Students  preparing to be science teachers will be involved with design,  testing and evaluation of the course.",
