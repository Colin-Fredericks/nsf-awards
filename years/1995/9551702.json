 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project a speech science laboratory for  undergraduate students is being developed.   Such a laboratory  encourages the development of scientific problem solving through  integration of hands-on experiences with basic undergraduate  coursework related to acoustic and physiologic aspects of speech.    Four computerized speech laboratories are being used by students  to examine acoustic characteristics of speech.   Three  computerized work stations supporting a number of different  pieces of equipment are being used to examine various physiologic  aspects of speech production.   Laboratory exercises are being  designed to provide students with the opportunity to learn about  the various processes of speech as well as the relationships  between different physiologic processes and the acoustic signal.    This type of hands-on experimentation serves the students well as  they move into graduate education and throughout their  professional careers.",
