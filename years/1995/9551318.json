 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university is developing a course on the principles and  technology of multimedia, intended for juniors and seniors in  Computer Science and Computer Engineering.   This course has a  significant lab component to demonstrate major ideas, generate  enthusiasm, and develop hands-on skills.   Major subjects include  signal processing, compression, scheduling, data retrieval,  interface design, device interfacing, networks, media (sound,  music, voice, images, graphics, video), and applications  programming.   Equipment for this lab consists of networked  personal computers, programming and applications software, and  I/O devices.  The course's progress is being measured with the  help of a group of outside experts.   The materials developed in  this lab include lab exercises, training materials,  recommendations on hardware and software, and software for  functions that are not commercially available.   These materials  will be made available electronically to other teachers.",
