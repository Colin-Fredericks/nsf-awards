 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop parallel numerical solution methods for use on distributed computers for solution of the model equations encountered in computer codes used in the electric utility industry. Computer codes used to perform design and safety analysis of electricity generators based on nuclear steam supply systems are an integral part of the electric utility industry in the United States. These codes typically contain complex two-fluid models for the fluid flow, multidimensional neutron kinetics models, one- and multidimensional heat conduction modeling, and models for equipment components that make up the steam supply system.  The major objective of the proposed research is the development and demonstration of numerical solution methods for a parallel computing environment made up of distributed workstations. The first objective will be parallel solution methods for large matrices. Solution of these matrices usually accounts for the largest single share of the CPU time used by the codes. Other parts of the numerical solution methods, such as the equation of state and engineering correlations for friction and heat transfer, are more nearly naturally parallel although load balancing will be required for these parts.",
