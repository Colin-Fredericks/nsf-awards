 "awd_abstract_narration": "Typical introductory statistics courses do not engage the  attention of modern students who come to class fresh from a world  of rapid-fire TV commercials, action movies, and dynamic video  games. This project, in conjunction with two companion projects,   uses the interactive capability of computers to teach basic  statistical concepts (distribution, variability, center, spread,  randomness, and association, to name a few) through hands-on  activities. Through creative use of technology, the content,  conduct, and quality of these courses are being revised to improve  the quantitative reasoning skills of all undergraduates, especially  those from traditionally nonquantitative disciplines. Students are  encouraged to learn for themselves by doing, observing, thinking  and consolidating while, the instructor becomes a catalyst and  coach instead of an authoritative lecturer.  The project is also  building a laboratory model that works for large sections of  introductory courses.",
