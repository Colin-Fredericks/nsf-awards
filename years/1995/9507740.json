 "awd_abstract_narration": "This group will pursue a broad program of research in  gravitation and astrophysics.  Among the topics to be  investigated are the following:    1)  Aspects of quantum gravity associated with noneuclidean  topology will be examined.  The possible existence of  stationary states with noneuclidean topology will be  considered in the context of asymptotically flat spacetimes  and spacetimes with Kaluza-Klein symmetries.  Complementary  approaches to quantization will be considered.    2)  In the area of quantum fields and gravitation, research  includes an investigation of the effect of quantum  electrodynamic anomalies on the energy density of fermions  in the expanding universe.  Also under study are quantum  corrections to the metrics of general relativistic fluid  spheres, the possible loss of information and correlations  in black hole evaporation, and relativistic Bose-Einstein  condensation in the early universe.    3)  Exotic processes in the early universe, such as the  formation of a network of cosmic strings, and the  amplification of quantum fluctuations by rapid expansion,  leave behind a stochastic background of gravitational waves.  A detailed study will be pursued to determine the observable  properties of these waves, their effects on the isotropy of  the Cosmic Background Radiation, and their detectability by  ground-and space-based gravitational wave antennae.    4)  Research in general-relativistic astrophysics will  include the construction of a code that computes the  nonaxisymmetric instability points of perfect fluids.  The  nonlinear dynamical evolution of unstable stars will be  examined in collaboration with workers developing a  relativistic 3+1 code.  Other work will involve the  determination of an upper limit on rotation independent of  the equation of state.    These topics are of high interest in exploring the  fundamentals of modern gravitation theory, and connecting it  to possible astronomical observations.",
