 "awd_abstract_narration": "9415936  Mueller    Reef-building corals display two modes of calcification,  that which occurs in the light and that taking place in the  dark.  Calcium carbonate deposition is greater  in the  light, a phenomenon attributed to the photosynthetic  activity of algal endosymbionts (zooxanthellae).  There is  evidence that the two modes may differ in mechanism as well  as quantitatively.  In spite of numerous studies, the link  between coral calcification and zooxanthellae photosynthesis  remains unresolved.  The significance of  this link can be  succinctly stated: the partnership of corals and their  zooxanthellae is essentially responsible for the existence  of the world's living (and most fossil) coral reefs.    A major question is whether either of the calcium carbonate  substrates, calcium and dissolved inorganic carbon dioxide,  are limiting to calcification and, if so, under what  conditions.  The importance of calcium to living systems has  led to a variety of well-conserved calcium regulatory  mechanisms, however, very little coral research has examined  such regulation.  This strategy has a large base of  information from research on other biomineralizing organisms  and in many areas of cellular physiology.  Such an approach,  coupled with recent advances in coral culture, promises  substantial progress in a research area that has made little  during the past decade.  This research project will focus on  whether coral calcification is limited by calcium  availability at the site of skeletogenesis (not in seawater)  and how availability may be affected by symbiont  photosynthetic activity.  Using a combination of  pharmacologic and kinetic approaches, the calcium pathway  from seawater to skeleton will be compartmentally  characterized.  Calcium movement and regulation between  compartments by membrane transport systems and messenger  systems (i.e. cAMP,  calmodulin ) will be of central  interest.         While this basic research question may be sufficient  justification for this projec t, there are benefits of more  practical value as well.  Optimization of coral culture  could have far reaching implications for coral reef  conservation.  Directly, it offers a means for propagation  of corals to repair damaged reefs.  Use of coral culture in  the aquarium trade could indirectly help natural reefs by  reducing the rapidly increasing wild harvest.  Understanding  the light-enhancement of coral calcification would allow  manipulation of culture conditions to produce skeletons with  consistent physical properties.  Such skeletons would be of  value for use in bone reconstruction where natural coral has  been successfully employed.  ***",
