 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Polya project is to increase productivity in  the development and maintenance of programs, by placing more  emphasis on the  user interface within the programming  language itself. This research seeks new  ways to write  programs, to make programs efficient, and to reuse program  parts. It is concerned directly with software engineering  and rapid  prototyping.    The programming language Polya incorporates new mechanisms  that  allow a group of people to define and use notations of  their problem domain, so  that programs can more closely  resemble the algorithms being used. Secondly,  Polya has  mechanisms that make  it  easier to describe how variables of high-level types  should be implemented,  requiring fewer modifications to the  algorithm than is the case with more  traditional languages.  The transform, a new kind of program part, can be reused  with relative ease. A prototype implementation of Polya uses  the Synthesizer  Generator as the platform.    This research focuses on three areas: (1) research  aimed at  a significant extension of the pattern matching capabilities  of the  Polya transformational approach and exploration of  new ideas on reverse  engineering; (2) experimentation with  Polya, in order to develop a library of  useful program  parts; (3) practical and theoretical improvements to Polya,  its  implementation, and related tools such as a source-level  debugger.",
