 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for the continuation of NSF support for  analysis of magnetic field observations acquired by APL-developed  satellite experiments.  The proposed research will make substantial  contributions to NSF initiatives such as GEM, CEDAR, and Space  Weather.  Satellite magnetic field data from Freja and Viking,  HILAT, DMSP-F7, TRIAD, AMPTE/CCE, MAGSAT, and UARS will be used in  studies of large and small scale current systems and magnetic wave  phenomena associated with the magnetospheric boundaries and current  source regions.  The intent is also to disseminate data and  information by way of scientific journal publications,  presentations, and collaborative efforts with individual scientists  and agency programs.  The proposal includes the Freja data  processing and analysis effort.  The following areas will be  investigated:  (1) Multiple data sets will be used to characterize  the distribution and source regions of the large scale currents and  their variation with the phase of geomagnetic storms, including  theoretical investigation of the current disruption process.  (2)  Identify and analyze simultaneous observations of large scale  currents to thoroughly characterize the local time and altitude  structure of the current systems.  (3) Conduct pilot studies of  Poynting flux using the Freja electric and magnetic field data,  concentrating on small and intermediate scales.  (4) Investigate  the detailed correlation of magnetic fluctuations with field  aligned currents and particle precipitation regions to put the use  of AC Fluctuations on a firm scientific footing.  (5) Refine  empirical models of the auroral oval shape and size to allow a more  reliable extrapolation of the auroral position in local time.  This  will involve inter-comparison of real-time predicted auroral  dynamics with Geomagnetic Induced Currents to quantitatively test  the model and forecasting system.  (6) The usefulness of the Freja  data and its importance to other programs motivates the developme nt  of an efficient means of rapidly disseminating these data to the  scientific community.  (7) Continue studies of wave phenomena.   Freja data cover a previously unexplored frequency range, and the  availability of simultaneous electric field and high time  resolution 3-D particle measurements assures that study of these  phenomena will yield important results concerning the dynamics of  the Birkeland current flow regions.  Also pursued, will be the  fluctuations inherent to the magnetopause current layer paying  particular attention to the correlation of these fluctuations with  theoretical predictions of current layer turbulence.",
