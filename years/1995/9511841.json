 "awd_abstract_narration": "Production of Videotape for Ethics Training of  Students.  This project will produce a play and a videotape of the play for widespread use in classroom instruction on science ethics.  The play will address the most significant ethical problems in science, including falsification of data, ownership of intellectual information, harassment, and other problems which plague all of our scientific establishments.  The play has been read and used in its script form at numerous universities and annual meetings of professional societies, and has the potential for being widely used in ethics training programs as mandated by the NIH and perhaps by other governmental agencies.  More specifically, the objective of this proposed project is to produce the play, using drama department personnel and facilities, and to videotape the production for dissemination to the widest possible audience.  A workbook consisting of historical material and discussion questions will accompany the videotape.  The videotape will be tested, revised, and made available through professional organizations and appropriate newsletters.  A demonstration will be conducted at the earliest meeting of the Association for Practical and Professional Ethics.",
