 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9505077 Luskin and James  This interdisciplinary group will  investigate nonlinear material  behavior and related issues in  analysis and computation. Its focus is  materials which undergo  martensitic and magnetic phase transitions,  with particular  application to shape memory and giant  magnetostrictive  materials. The theories and computational methods  under  development by the authors will be applied to the design of  new  actuator materials and composites. The authors propose to  design  a composite that exhibits a strong two way shape memory  effect,  design small scale, large-force actuators with low hysteresis,   and formulate a strategy for finding a magneto-memory material, a   material which would combine the most useful aspects of a shape   memory (large strain) and magnetostrictive (actuated by a  magnetic  field) material. The quantitative description of these  phenomena  rests in the framework of nonlinear analysis, in  particular within the  context of non-convex potentials whose  equilibria are highly  oscillatory across widely varying length  scales. Innovative numerical  methods and codes will be developed  to compute the dynamics of  complex microstructure in response to  a variety of environmental  changes.   Active materials, that is,  materials whose structure transforms  dramatically when subjected  to external stimuli like heat or  electromagnetic fields, have  enormous potential for use as actuators  and sensors across the  spectrum of technology, from aerospace to  communications to  medicine. This project addresses basic research  directed toward  the improvement and optimization of these  materials and the  discovery of new ones. The interplay between  their  microstructure and macroscopic properties is fundamental to   their exploitation and the study of these properties leads to the   frontiers of nonlinear theory, nonlinear analysis, and scientific   computation. The interdisciplinary training of graduate students  and  postdoctoral associates is an integra l part of this project.",
