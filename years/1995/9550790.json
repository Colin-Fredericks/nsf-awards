 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Psychology Department has developed an interdepartmental  neuroscience major.   Essential to this program is the recently  renovated Laboratory of Quantitative Neuromorphology, for which  this project funds new equipment.   Educationally, the overall  purpose of the laboratory is to transcend information in  textbooks and lectures by involving students with closely  supervised, hands-on research experience using state-of-the-art  equipment to explore the human brain at the gross and  microanatomic level.   Furthermore, a fundamental belief behind  the neuroscience program is that knowledge of the brain  profoundly affects one's perception and appreciation of personal,  linguistic, psychological, and sociopolitical phenomena.   The  long-term research goal is to develop a quantitative dendritic  and spine map of the human cerebral cortex to supplement  qualitative knowledge of the same.    Four pieces of equipment  are involved: (1) a Neurolucida system, a state-of-the-art,  comprehensive, interactive image analysis program for three-  dimensional morphometry of microscopic tissue sections; (2) a  multihead Olympus microscope, which is an efficient and effective  teaching tool that permits three individuals (i.e., the professor  and two students) to examine stained tissue simultaneously; (3) a  Campden Vibroslice vibratome for sectioning tissue; and (4) a  PowerMac computer system for classroom demonstrations, tutorials,  interactive educational programs, and data analysis/presentations  by students doing individual research projects.",
