Meinzer, Hawaiian Sugar Planters   Association, and P. Rundel and P. Jackson, Univ. of California  Los Angeles,  to  Brazil.   They will be working with Dr. A. Franco, of the Univ. of Brasilia and his students, on   determining the extent of temporal and spatial  partitioning of soil water and nutrient   resources among representative woody plant species of  a cerrado of central Brazil.  They   also propose to examine related above ground processes, such as long term water use   efficiency, nitrogen use efficiency,  and other ecophysiological parameters as measures of   resource use and competition.      Stable hydrogen isotope techniques will  be used to address the question of soil water   resource partitioning.  Stable nitrogen isotopes will  be used to distinguish modes of   nitrogen acquisition among species (i.e. nitrogen fixers from non fixers).  To integrate   below ground and above ground processes, stable carbon isotopes will be used to assess   long-term intrinsic water-use efficiency.  Gas exchange measurements will be used to   determine the mechanisms by which variation in water use efficiency is achieved.    Representative woody plant species  with different patterns of leaf production and other   characteristics will be selected for the study.   ***",
