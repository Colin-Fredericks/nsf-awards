 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fauci       The investigator develops and implements computational  methods for modeling the fluid dynamics problems of aquatic animal  locomotion across a wide range of animal sizes.  Of interest are  both the dynamics of a single organism and the relationship of its  morphology to its motility properties, and the collective  hydrodynamic interactions of groups of swimmers with each other  and their environment.  Applications studied include bacterial  chemotaxis in micropores, spermatozoa motility in the reproductive  tract, and the coupling of active and passive tissue properties to  the external swimming mechanics of a leech.  Bacterial chemotaxis  in micropores is of special interest, because the transport  behavior of microorganisms through porous media is important in  studying the contamination of groundwater supplies.  Although  bioremediation, the process by which microbes degrade  contaminants, has field scale implications, the detailed study of  pore-level behavior of the coupled fluid-contaminant-microbial  system is essential.  The project's computational model includes  the detailed analysis of hydrodynamics, contaminant reaction,  diffusion and convection, and the chemotactic responses of the  swimming microbes.  This allows the systematic study of the  influence of different parameters, such as swimming speed,  diffusion rates, microbial uptake rates, as well as stochastic  parameters relating to the likelihood with which microbes change  their swimming direction in response to the evolving contaminant  field.  This is difficult, if not impossible, to examine in a  laboratory environment.       The project studies the way organisms swim, using  computational models.  The organisms studied vary in size from  bacteria to leeches.  Of paramount importance in the study of  bacterial transport in micropores is the growth of biofilms.  Under  certain physical and chemical conditions, microbes adhere to each  other and the local pore structure.  This biofilm growth affects  and is affe cted by the local flow characteristics and contaminant  transport.  The computational model has the ability to model  complex, dynamic fluid-structure interactions.  Agglomeration is  modeled by exerting appropriate binding stresses between discrete  representations of organisms, that may hold them together, or, if  fluid stresses are large, may yield and release the organisms.  The  model is a powerful tool for understanding biofilm processes at a  micropore level.  This has important consequences for environmental  problems.",
