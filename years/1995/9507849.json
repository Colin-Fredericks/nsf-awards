 "awd_abstract_narration": "The errors young children make during the course of language  acquisition give researchers strong evidence that grammar is not  learned through pure imitation. One error that is a  characteristic of the acquisition of English is the pronoun case  error. It is typical for a 2 or 3 year old child to say something  like \"*Her crashed\" when the child apparently means to say \"She  crashed\". These errors are actually a form of overextension, that  is, children overextend the use of a pronominal case form, in  this example \"her\", into the syntactic environment of another, in  this example, that of \"she\". Although psycholinguists have known  of these overextensions for a relatively long time, only recently  have they proposed testable hypotheses about the nature and  causation of these pronoun case overextensions. This research  project tests unique predictions of the Pronoun Paradigm Building  Hypothesis of pronoun case overextension, and asks three research  questions: (1) Are \"he\" and \"they\" overextended more often than  \"she\"?; (2) Do the overextensions of third person pronouns  exhibit a positive correlation between bias and rate of  overextension?; and, (3) Is \"her\" overextended more than \"him\"  and \"them\"? In the study, 30 children between the ages of 30 and  36 months will be audiotaped as they interact with their primary  caregivers in three activities designed to encourage the use of  third person pronouns: (1) playing with a Little Tikes toy set,  (2) the viewing and description of a family photo-album, and (3)  reading a picture book. The project will take one year to  complete.",
