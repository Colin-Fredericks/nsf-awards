 "awd_abstract_narration": "9500957  Rockafeller  This project centers on optimization problems concerned with the  management or control of systems with dynamical structure.  For  problems in continuous time, such as arise in the optimal control  mf engineering systems and economic models, new forms of  variational analysis will be developed in order to characterize  solutions more concretely and in a wider variety of settings.  In  particular, issues of solution stability will be studied.  For  problems in discrete time, models of decision-making under  uncertainty will be the focus.  Connections between stochastic  programming and dynamic programming will be elucidated and made  the basis of new approaches to the design of computational  methods for finding solutions.    The work will deal with mathematical innovations necessary to  understand the effects of different control strategies in  situations that heretofore have resisted effective modeling.   Especially important are the ways of representing mathematically  the revelation over time of information about  random elements in  a problem's structure.  A combination of scenario trees with  state-variable dynamics will be explored for this purpose.   Extended linear-quadratic programming will be utilized to allow  penalty expression of constraints and to promote dualization  leading to numerical schemes in which problems of enormous scale  can be broken down iteratively into problems solvable on  high-speed computers.  ***",
