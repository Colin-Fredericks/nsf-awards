 "awd_abstract_narration": "A theory of values and their measurement will be developed on the basis of two distinctions among  types of values: protected values vs. well-behaved values, and fundamental vs. proxy values.  Protected values, in contrast to well behaved values, resist tradeoffs with other values and concern  means rather than ends.  For example, some people think that destruction of species by logging should  be stopped at any cost.  Proxy values are stand-ins for fundamental values, to which they are related  through beliefs (often uncertain).  For example, percent of children vaccinated is a proxy for disease  prevention, to which it is related by beliefs about vaccine effectiveness.  These distinctions can  help us understand inconsistency in measurement of values for environmental amenities and government  policies.  Two types of inconsistency involve insensitivity to quantity (e.g., insensitivity to range  in assigning relative weights to attributes, quantity insensitivity in contingent valuation), and  nonconsequential principles that lead to different valuations of identical outcomes achieved by  different means (e.g., use of cost rather than benefit in contingent valuation, omission bias).  Hypotheses regarding the sources of these inconsistencies will be tested by examining the effects of:  fundamental vs. proxy values; information relating proxy to fundamental values; manipulations of the  measurement task to bring subjects' approach in line with its purpose; and combinations of these  manipulations.  It will also be determined whether increased consistency within each of two measures  will increase agreement between them. This project is supported by the EPA/NSF Valuation for  Environmental Policy funding opportunity.",
