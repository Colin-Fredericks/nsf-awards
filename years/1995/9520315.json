Funding is  provided through the Divisions of Materials Research,  Mathematical Sciences and Advanced Scientific Computing, as  well as by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the  Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  The  research combines algorithm and code development with  materials theory to address important materials problems for  which computational breakthroughs can produce large payoffs.  As such, the research spans the strategic initiatives in  High Performance Computing and Communications and Advanced  Materials and Processing    Phase transformation and electronic structure properties of  realistically modeled crystalline and amorphous materials  will be studied using a new tight binding molecular dynamics  code.  This new technique represents a compromise between  computationally infeasible ab initio  techniques and faster  - but less accurate - methods that employ classical  potentials.  The tight binding molecular dynamics method has  non-orthogonal basis functions and handles electrostatic  interactions.  This will allow the study of inhomogeneous  systems such as amorphous materials and interfaces, as well  as ceramic materials which have significant ionic character  in their bonding.  The method will build on previous linear  scaling techniques which are explicitly parallelizable.  The  codes will be implemented on the Cornell SP-2.  This new  technique will allow the study of a variety of physical  systems and processes, inaccessible by previous methods,  such as solid/liquid and solid/solid phase transformations,  defect diffusion in materials and amorphous materials.    Besides Cornell, the team includes participants from  Corning, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oxford University,  AT&T Bell Laboratories, IBM and DEC.  %%%   This award is one made through the FY95 Computational  Approaches to Real Materials competition.

As such, the research spans the strategic initiatives in  High Performance Computing and Communications and Advanced  Materials and Processing    The research will involve a complementary team who will  apply fundamental aspects of materials physics to understand  and simulate the large scale processing of materials.  Such  processing phenomena as solid/solid phase  transformations  and solid/liquid phase transformations will be modeled.  In  addition, the simulations will be large enough so that the  effects of defects and their kinetics will be studied.  The  use of new algorithms and their implementation on massively  parallel computers enable these ambitious calculations to be  done.  The results will be a major contribution to the  design and processing control of new materials.  ***",
