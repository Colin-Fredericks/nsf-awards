The research equipment obtained through  this award will provide enhanced analytical capability to five  faculty and the staff chemist who are conducting research on  water disinfection byproducts, groundwater treatment to remove  organic solvent contaminants, groundwater flow and quality  modeling, ion-exchange methods for removing metal contaminants  from soil and water, and modeling of interfacial phenomena for  decontaminating soil.    The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to  the National Science Foundation's Instrumentation Development and  Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 94-156, Academic Research  Infrastructure Program.   Results of this award are expected to  improve the accessibility of modern research instrumentation for  use by this institution's faculty in conducting research on  important topics of environmental significance and in educating  students.  ***",
