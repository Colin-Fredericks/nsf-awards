 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U. S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Award supports travel  expenses and some expendable research   supplies related to the visits of Drs. D. Resasco, Univ. of Oklahoma, Norman, OK  and G. Larsen, U. of    Nebraska, Lincoln, NE to Argentina.  The purpose of the visits is to perform research on the activation of   lower alkanes to produce olefins, oxygenates and higher hydrocarbons.  The Argentine co-P.I. is Dr. J.   Parera, of INCAPE, Universidad Nacional del Litoral .  Dr.  A. J. Rouco, Universidad del Sur, Bahia   Blanca, will also be involved in the research.    The project consists of two parts. The first will deal with the dehydrogenation of  lower alkanes over Pt-  based catalysts.  The  research will attempt to demonstrate that the addition of promoters alters the surface   concentration of H under certain reaction conditions. The effect of the alteration on the activation and   stability of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts will be investigated, and the catalytic materials will be fully   characterized.   The second part of the project will examine the activation of alkanes over solid superacid catalysts.  Several  reactions, such as methane-olefin alkylation isobutene-isobutylene alkylation and n-butane isomerization  will be studied.  The effects of Mn and Fe as promoters for  the catalytic activity of sulfated zirconia will be investigated.  The research will attempt to determine whether such promotion results in highly active acid materials able to convert methane at low temperatures.  The effects of Pt and  Sn as promoters for improving the life of the catalyst will also be investigated.  The research will focus on elucidating deactivation mechanisms, and on determining whether the presence of Pt and Sn modifies the nature and rate of coke formation.   Such promotion may result in a catalyst with a very high activity and, in consequence, able to operate at relatively low temperatures at which equilibrium conversions are high.",
