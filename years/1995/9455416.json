 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transforming Traditional Quantitative Analysis into a Course in  Modern Analytical Science.  This curriculum development project transforms traditional  sophomore quantitative analysis into a course on modern  analytical science.  Building on work supported by the NSF, we  are developing a course that emulates the working environment  of a modern commercial analytical laboratory.  The new lab work  reflects a commitment to addressing organic, biological, and  environmental studies, in place of much of the traditional  emphasis on simple inorganic systems. The types of  investigations include: separations science (mixture analysis);  multi-element and trace analysis; and combined physical &  chemical characterization. Pervading all of this is a  laboratory structure based on Federal Good Laboratory Practice  guidelines, where students are responsible for calibration,  certification, and documentation. The objectives of Phase 2 of  this project, proposed here, are (1) to conduct a realistic  experiment in transportability of the re-structured sophomore  quant course; and (2) to produce a Laboratory Manual which is  flexible enough to be useful even at institutions with limited  resources. We have enlisted the cooperation of a small but  diverse group of interested academic institutions to test  transportability at their respective campuses. These schools  will also provide feedback regarding laboratory revisions to  help accommodate the wide diversity of academic resources. We  will initiate Phase 2 with a summer workshop in 1995 at SJSU  for all participating faculty. This event will be repeated  through 1997, with a viable Laboratory Manual as the ultimate  product.",
