 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemical and material manufacturing industries have made  a major commitment to making products and process safer and more  environmentally friendly.  To accomplish this, these industries  have placed tighter controls on processing, increased process  instrumentation, and generally increased process complexity to  minimize waste production.  This increase in sophistication has  placed substantially increased responsibility on the process  operator.       The innovative two-year degree program in Chemical Engineering  Technology:  Advanced Process Operations outlined in this proposal  draws upon a strong partnership between Dow Corning Corporation and  Dow Chemical Company, major chemical and material manufacturers;  Delta College, a community college system serving the manufacturing  area; and Michigan Technological University, a major engineering  and technological university.  The proposed degree program will  consist of a first-year program taught at Delta College where high  school articulation agreements and diversity outreach initiatives  are well established.  Due to proximity, work internships will be  possible with the industrial partners.  Upon successful completion  of this first year experience based on academic performance and  work-related recommendations, students can transfer to the  second-year academic program at Michigan Tech.  The second year  will stress engineering technology with a strong laboratory  component leading to a capstone pilot plant experience in the new  multipurpose pilot plant facilities of the Process Simulation and  Control Center.  Cooperative and apprentice experiences will be  available during the second year.       This industry/college/university partnership between a local  community college, a major university, and two major process  industries will enable the development and implementation of a  model program which will lead to highly trained process operators  who are comfortable with new process technologies, the regulations  which shape  these industries, and the safety and teamwork skills  which are adaptive to the changing high performance workplace of  the chemical and material processing industry.",
