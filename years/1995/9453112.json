 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453112  Johnson    Inter-connected activities of Cranbrook Institute of Science and Oakland University seek to help  change the infrastructure of schools and the University.  The project aims to create a new  generation of teachers trained to be gender fair, and to make gender-fair teaching practices more  pervasive.  It seeks to measure science club and other informal science experiences for girls as  vehicles for changing classroom climates; and it aims to assess the value of a community-based  resource center to help sustain support for girls in science education.      The project builds upon a NSF-funded Model Project for Women and Girls at Cranbrook, which  has addressed basic issues of gender equity through informal science activities, as well as upon  more than a decade of experience in collaborative work with pre-service university students who  will be the science teachers of tomorrow.  These students have not yet established their patterns  of classroom leadership behavior, and their attitudes toward younger students and teaching  practices can still be influenced to recognize and eliminate conscious/unconscious discrimination  against girls.  Teams of experts on classroom gender bias are to serve as trainers in gender-fair  behavior, which is then to be applied and evaluated in classrooms.  A second thrust focuses on  girls' science clubs and builds upon accumulating evidence that informal science activities for  girls outside the classroom favorably impacts in-school science learning.  Intensive evaluation  is to determine if middle school girls who choose to join weekly science clubs in Pontiac  demonstrate more positive behaviors in their science and math classes, and if they contribute to  changes in the classroom climates.  Trained Oakland University pre-service students and  Cranbrook staff will lead the girls' science clubs.  The third element is to provide continuing  support for girls, teachers, and parents, through a resource center at Cranbrook.  Mentoring  assistance, ref errals, workshops, information and materials are to be readily accessible to help  sustain connections among girls, parents, teachers and SEMs (science, engineering and  mathematics) professionals.    ***",
