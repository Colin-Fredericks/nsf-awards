 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9415558  Shock    This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative  research in geochemistry between Everest L. Shock of  Washington University and Vladimir Mayer of the University  of Blaise Pascal.  The objective of their research is to  test models of thermodynamic data with experimental  measurements for a wide variety of aqueous inorganic and  organic fluids.  Minerals, gases, organic compounds,  microorganisms and the byproducts of human activity are  brought into contact by aqueous fluids in relatively shallow  regions of the earth's crust.  These fluids facilitate  reactions which would otherwise be sluggish.  Accurate  thermodynamic data for dissolved ions, electrolytes, gases,  and organic compounds are needed to develop predictive  models.    Dr. Shock brings to this collaboration his expertise in  theoretical geochemistry.  He has developed a model for  prediction of thermodynamic data for thousands of aqueous  organic and inorganic species.  Data are incomplete or  wholly lacking at high temperatures.  The French  investigator, Dr. Mayer, has worked for a number  of years  in the generation of high temperature measurements for these  species.  His experimental work will provide the high  temperature data that are needed to extend the accuracy and  applicability of the existing model.  Their joint effort  will advance our understanding of sub-surface earth  processes and improve current efforts to contain, and  eventually avoid environmental problems.  ***",
