 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509088  McKitrick         Birds possess more hindlimb muscles than their closest  living relatives, the crocodiles and alligators.  In addition,  some muscles primitively present in birds have been lost numerous  times within the avian lineage during the course of history.  If  historical relationships among crocodilians and birds  (archosaurs) are to be understood, hypotheses must be constructed  about the sequence of appearance and loss of specific muscles or  muscle parts.  Prior to such analysis, however, it is crucial to  develop hypotheses about which muscles in birds and crocodilians  are homologous in the historical sense, i.e., which muscles  correspond in the two groups.  Identifying these homologies has  not been possible with traditional techniques such as gross  anatomical study of muscle form.  In this proposal, a new  approach will be taken to analyze homologies in archosaur  hindlimb muscles by the use of developmental studies of muscle  proteins using avian and crocodilian embryos.  Muscle proteins  have different types, termed isoforms, at different stages of  organismal development,and these are highly conserved among  species.  The developmental shifts in isoforms of contractile  proteins such as actins, myosins, tropomyosins and troponins, as  well as other related proteins follow specific patterns.  The  earliest forms of these proteins are replaced by embryonic  versions and later by neonatal and adult forms.  Since individual  muscle groups bear \"signature\" sequential patterns, the PI will  examine the protein isoforms and their messages in birds and  crocodilians to see whether muscles of known homology in the two  groups have retained the ancestral patterns.  If so, such  patterns can be used to hypothesize historical relationships  between muscles of heretofore questionable homology.   %%%  This approach has the potential to solve important problems in  comparative biology about the relationship among traits in  related organisms where historical change has in effect   obliterated the record.  ***",
