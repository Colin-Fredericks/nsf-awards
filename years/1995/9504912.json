 "awd_abstract_narration": "9504912  Handel       The project concerns the outer automorphism group of a free  group and pseudo-Anosov surface dynamics.  One part is a  continuation of joint work with Mladen Bestvina and Mark Feighn  concerning three problems.  The first is a characterization of  subgroups of polynomial growth outer automorphisms. The second is  to extend their proof of the Tits Alternative by showing that all  virtually solvable subgroups of the outer automorphism group are  virtually abelian.  The third is to show that the mapping torus of  an outer automorphism is coherent.  The goal of the other part of  the project is to use combinatorial group theory methods,  especially folding, to analyze a dynamically defined partial order  on conjugacy classes in the mapping class group of a punctured  disk.       Two fields of mathematics interact in this project: dynamical  systems and combinatorial group theory, the latter, perhaps  surprisingly, contributing a powerful method for studying the  former.  In dynamical systems, the focus is on the long-term  patterns that occur in a changing, or evolving system, for example  a system of orbiting planets and their sun.  Combinatorial group  theory is the study of algebraic objects called groups using  topological and combinatorial methods.  One part of the project  examines an important family of two-dimensional dynamical systems  known as pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms and uses a tool from  combinatorial group theory called \"folding\" to analyze the  relationship between various members of this family.  Another part  of the project relates to a group whose elements are the algebraic  analogs of the pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms.  While most research  in this area is derived from geometry, in this project the  principal investigator will add dynamical systems techniques in  order to investigate this group in greater detail.  ***",
