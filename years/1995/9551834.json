The Cell Biology course meets these  requirements. Currently, the laboratory portion of this course is  taught in small groups in a research lab utilizing limited  equipment. A Cell Biology Teaching Lab has been identified; the  purpose of this proposal is to remedy the equipment limitations. A  thematic approach to studying cellular processes at the whole cell,  organelle, & molecular levels is proposed. At the whole cell level  students learn tissue culture techniques and localize organelles  and proteins in-situ. Studies at the organelle level include  isolation and identification of mitochondria. Isolation and  characterization of mt DNA and proteins demonstrates analysis at  the molecular level. Experiences in manipulating cellular responses  and computer-assisted learning are planned. The equipment requested  will allow 20-24 students to participate in these activities. This  theme based, integrated lab experience is a departure from the  traditional single-exercise approach. An added dimension is  allowing students to develop tissue culture techniques, an  increasingly important exposure in this age of animal rights  concerns. This integrated approach will be reported in the  literature as a major contribution to the field of cell biology  laboratory instruction.",
