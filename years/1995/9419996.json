 "awd_abstract_narration": "9419996  Goetz      The International Symposium on the Reproductive Physiology of Fish (ISRPF) was first organized and held in 1977 in Paimpont, France. This meeting was followed by a second ISRPF in 1983 in Wageningen, the Netherlands, a third in 1987 in St. John's, Newfoundland and the most recent ISRPF was held in 1991 in Norwich, England.  The primary goal of the ISRPF is to foster the exchange and dissemination of the most recent information on the reproductive physiology of fish.  Further, this exchange has included both basic and applied researchers.  One important objective is to promote the application of basic research information and, in reverse, to inform basic researchers of relevant problems facing applied researahers.  The meeting covers a wide range of disciplines within fish reproductive physiology from cell/molecular biology to behavior and the physiological ecology of fish.  For the first time, the ISRPF will hold its meeting in the United States on July 2-8, 1995 at the Jester Center Halls of the University of Texas at Austin.  The organization and operation of the fifth ISRPF is being carried out by a Local Organizing Committee headed by Peter Thomas (Chairperson - U. of Texas, Austin), and the scientific program is being organized by a Scientific Program Committee led by Dr. Frederick Goetz (Chairperson - U. of Notre Dame).  The scientific program will consist of five days of single session oral presentations and posters. All oral presentations will be invited and the presenters chosen by the Scientific Program Committee.  Sessions will specifically cover gonadal physiology, gametogenesis, the hypothalamic/pituitary axis, aquaculture, behavior, reproductive life history and environmental influences on reproduction.  Proceedings of the oral presentations and posters will be published as a book within six months of the meeting.  Financial support, obtained from this grant, will be used specifically to defray the registration costs for graduate students and postdoctorateq so t hat it is possible for them to attend the meeting.  ***",
