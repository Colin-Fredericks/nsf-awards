 "awd_abstract_narration": "9453715  Edelson    The techniques of scientific visualization have had a tremendous  impact on the practice of science over a relatively short period of  time because of the unparalleled capacity scientific visualization  provides for human observations of relationships, patterns, and  processes in large quantities data.  This research will attempt to  demonstrate that the techniques of scientific visualization can  have a similar impact in educational environments for similar  reasons.  The goal of the research is to assess whether the use of  scientific visualization in the course of inquiry-based learning  can enable students across the spectrum of academic ability to  develop a scientific understanding of complex, even chaotic  phenomena, such as climate, weather, and atmospheric greenhouse  effect.  Understanding of these complex natural phenomena has been  out of reach of all but the brightest and most highly motivated  students with traditional instructional techniques.    Our previous research has demonstrated that scientific  visualization can be a valuable learning tool for students engaged  in inquiry-based learning.  However, this research also revealed  the need for a software architecture for scientific visualization  that provides learner support targeted specifically at the use of  visualization in the course of inquiry-based learning.  This  research-guided transformation of tools and techniques developed  for use by scientists into environments to support students in the  development of robust scientific understanding is a significant  challenge.  As part of this research, we will develop  and evaluate  supportive scientific visualization environments for the study of  two important areas of atmospheric science: climate/weather and  atmospheric greenhouse effect.  Using these environments, we will  conduct a set of four studies designed to examine the prospects and  the challenges of scientific visualization as technology for  secondary science education.  In these studies, we  will examine the  ways in which the supportive scientific visualization architecture,  in comparison to other instructional approaches, can impact both  students' conceptual understanding and the process by which they  conduct scientific inquiry.  We uill examine the process by which  students learn to make sense from scientific visualizations and the  way that scientific visualization environments are adopted in  inquiry-based classrooms.  ***",
