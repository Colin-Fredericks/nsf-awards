 "awd_abstract_narration": "9414097  Pope      This U.S.-Polish Joint Cooperative Research on \"Activation of Small Molecules  on Polyoxometalate Surfaces\" is between Dr. Michael T. Pope of Georgetown  University and  Dr. Krzysztof Filipek of the University of Silesia.  The  proposed collaboration is related to Dr. Pope's current NSF grant, CHE-  9215228, \"Modulation of Surface Reactivity of Large Polyoxometalate Anions.\"   Specifically, the principal investigators intend to explore and/or develop the  activation of small molecules (e.g., NO, NO2, CO2, SO2, O2) by appropriately  modified polyoxometalate anions in aqueous and non-aqueous solvents.  The  binding of NO, O2, SO2, and CO2 to polyoxometalates has already been  demonstrated in earlier work from Georgetown and elsewhere.  The focus of Dr.  Filipek's recent research has been on the binding and multi-electron reduction  of dinitrogen and nitrogen oxides with ruthenium-containing polyoxometalates.   this ties in closely with the experience developed at Georgetown regarding the  redox chemistry of polyoxometalates, and the characterization of  tungstoruthenates.  The ability of polyoxometalates reversibly to accept two,  four, or more electrons suggests that pathways could exist for channelling  reduction equivalents to the bound \"substrates.:  It is clear because of the  strong overlap in interests, both research programs will benefit from the  collaboration.                                                  This proposed research in polyoxometalate chemistry fulfills the program  objectives of advancing science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and  Poland to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas  of strong mutual interest and competence.  ***",
