One of the final steps in viral  assembly is the packaging of the viral genome into a protective  protein coat known as the capsid, or head. Similar mechanisms for  DNA packaging have been proposed for all of the doublestranded  DNA bacteriophages and likely apply to mammalian viruses such as  adenovirus and herpesvirus. Terminases are enzymes common to all  of these viruses and are responsible for packaging of a single  genome from a concatameric precursor. Bacteriophage lambda has  been extensively studied over the years and represents an ideal  system in which to study viral DNA packaging.  Phage lambda  terminase possesses site-specific endonuclease and ATPase  catalytic activities which work in concert to effect DNA  packaging. The P.I. has previously characterized the endonuclease  and ATPase activities of this enzyme utilizing well defined  biochemical assay systems. These experiments were performed in  the absence of viral proheads, however, and thus examined the  initiation of the packaging process. The experiments described  here extend this work and focus on the termination of packaging .  Physical and kinetic techniques are utilized in order to dissect  the role of protein and DNA in the termination process. The  energetics of the packaging process are addressed with the use of  high-energy ATP analogs.  Phage lambda terminase binds both ATP and DNA as substrates  utilized in the packaging reaction. Photo-affinity labeling  experiments are designed to locate the nucleotide binding sites  within the primary sequence of the protein. Amino acids critical  to binding and/or catalysis by the enzyme are also examined by  proteolytic digestion of the modified protein and peptide mapping  techniques. Finally, experiments which will ultimately lead to a  crystal structure for the small subunit of this DNA packaging  enzyme  are described. The terminase enzyme from bacteriophage  lambda bears functional similarities to terminases from all of  the double-stranded DNA viruses and, while the mechanistic  details differ, the data derived from these experiments may be  used to model DNA packaging by all of these viruses. An  understanding of how the multiple catalytic activities work in  concert to effect viral assembly may yield insight into the  general mechanisms of DNA manipulation by multifunction,  multiprotein enzyme complexes. The information derived from these  experiments thus extends beyond a study of viral assembly and may  yield insight into the basic properties of multiprotein enzyme  complexes.  %%%  This laboratory is interested in how a virus is assembled from  protein and DNA precursors synthesized within the infected cell.  The research centers on bacteriophage lambda,a DNA virus that  infects E. coli. This virus utilizes an enzyme known as terminase  to package its chromosome into a protective protein coat known as  the pre-capsid, or prohead. This enzyme, along with other  proteins of both viral and host origin, assemble onto viral DNA  and use the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to \"stuff\" the  chromosome into the confined space found within the capsid. This  laboratory is investigating the biochemical and biophysical  properties of phage lambda terminase as a model for DNA packaging  by several bacterial viruses as well as mammalian viruses such as  herpesvirus. They are interested in the role of each of the  proteins required to package viral DNA and how these proteins  come together to accurately and efficiently assemble an  infectious virus.  ***",
