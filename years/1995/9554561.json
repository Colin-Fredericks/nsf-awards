Codesign provides  methods and techniques which can  effectively and efficiently manage  the diversity and complexity of  applications employing embedded  systems. They result in a decreased  development cost of complex systems  and their time to market  deployment.  Our proposed research targets are:  a)implementation independent  specification and modeling of  embedded systems, b) associated  partitioning, based on iterative  refinement, c) construction of  modules for mixed software/hardware  components, and d) component  mapping to target implementations.  These key target areas will form  the foundation for the development  of a graduate research training  program.  The baseline for the proposed  effort is our internationally  recognized research in the areas of  codesign, computer systems  engineering, design and synthesis  of VLSI systems, and advanced work  in multi-chip module (MCM)  partitioning and behavioral  synthesis.  Technical Innovation:  In the  proposes research, concepts,  techniques and tools for the design  of high-performance, low-cost  systems that consists of hardware  and software components will be  developed that transform an  implementation independent, model-  based description into a working  prototype.  Structural Innovation:  Joint work  and continuous interaction with  local (State of Arizona) industrial  partners, international  collaborators, student exchanges,  and industrial mentorship.  The  development of a state-of-the-art  graduate program in codesign  providing a broad based, academic  and industrial experience and thus  training future science and  engineering leaders.",
