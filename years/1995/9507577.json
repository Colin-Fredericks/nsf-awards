Jorge Cabanas Moreno and Hector Calderon Benavides of  the Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN) in Mexico City, for  research on the mechanical behavior and characterization of  nanocrystalline metals, and the kinetics of coarsening of  coherent particles in nickel and iron-based alloys.  In  studying the mechanical properties and internal structure of  nanocrystalline metals, samples will be prepared by  mechanical alloying/mechanical milling and two other  synthesis routes.  Thus the influence of preparation method  on properties and grain boundary behavior will be examined.  The coarsening behavior of coherent particles in metal  alloys will be studied as a function of lattice mismatch in  samples containing bimodal particle distributions.    The proposed research collaboration will benefit from the  extensive experience at Northwestern University on the  mechanical properties and internal structure of  nanocrystalline materials and the synthesis and processing  routes followed by the Mexican side.  This award will also  facilitate the travel of students, thus providing them with  an international research experience early in their careers.  ***",
