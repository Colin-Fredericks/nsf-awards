 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes to develop a dynamic simulation model as applied to fuel cells, one of the most promising technologies for distributed generation. To facilitate high penetration into utility grids, fuel cell power plants are desired to be fully automated with remote monitoring, capable of load-following, and availabilities of more than 95%. The distinctive feature of dynamic simulation approach to control of power plants is to enable the designers to test power plant's transient response to load variations, system upsets, and other modes of operation prior to plant construction. Another unique feature of dynamic simulation includes: increased flexibility in implementing advanced control strategies and utilizing state-of-the-art algorithms such as robust, fuzzy logic and neural network in fuel cell power plants. It will also include development of power management and supervisory control of such plants, leading to a highly automated generation system. Use of advanced control systems make it possible to improve the operating flexibility and enhance the life of a power plant and will ensure the plant's reliability during rapid load changes without stressing the key components of the plant. The dynamic simulation and intelligent control will ultimately lead to cost-cutting benefits associated with operator training, efficiency, availability and reliability of the fuel cell power plants.",
