 "awd_abstract_narration": "9410039  Hall  The research will focus on three related projects. The first  project will study the determinants of productivity across  the states of the United States. The cross-state analysis  attempts to assess the role of geographic proximity as a  determinant of productivity. The model also accounts for  cross- state spillovers and spillovers from different types  of goods. The second project will study variations in  productivity across countries with a host of explanatory  variables. The main emphasis is on examining the importance  of rent-seeking behavior on productivity. The third project  will examine the creation of value within manufacturing  corporations in the United states and will investigate the  extent to which various aspects of corporate governance  affect the creation of value within corporations. The  emphasis in this part of the study is on examining the role  of variables such as the size of the board of directors, the  role of the management of the board, and the incentive  programs for managers, among others things, in creating  value.       This project is important because it promises to  provide results that would greatly enhance our understanding  of differences in productivity across states in the United  States and differences in productivity across countries.",
