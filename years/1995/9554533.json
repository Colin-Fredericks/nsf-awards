 "awd_abstract_narration": "GER-9554533  Forrest  We propose an innovative program  that provides unique research and educational experiences  for  graduate students pursuing a career  in photonics at Princeton  University. The requested five Graduate Research  Traineeships will accelerate the growth of a newly  established division concentrating  on optics and optoelectronic engineering within the  Department  of Electrical Engineering. This program forms the nucleus of  an inter-institutional  multidisciplinary effort to provide educational and research  opportunities in optical sciences  and engineering, including optical communications, advanced  photonic materials and devices, and  biomedical applications. To promote and facilitate this  ambitious  effort, the Advanced Technology  Center for Photonics and Optoelectronic Materials (ATC/POEM)  was established at Princeton  through a grant from the State of  New Jersey in 1989. This center tightly couples POEM faculty  and students with the photonics  industry, who have been engaged  over the last several years in an effective program of  technology transfer from academia to the industrial  sector. Hence, POEM  forms the focus of these future careers in both large and  small photonics-based companies. As part  of this proposal, we will encourage students to work  directly with  these companies under direct,  joint supervision between the  faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering  and their industrial supervisor. In the  Appendix we include four letters of commitment from  industrial participants to these Graduate Research  Traineeships.    Furthermore, we will work closely  with undergraduate institutions  which will act as \"feeders\" of  highly qualified and interested undergraduates, to  provide both the student and their undergraduate advisor  with relevant experiences  in optical sciences and technology. The northeast has a  wealth of undergraduate institutions which  are world-renown for their quality  of education. Hence, Princeton is well-positioned to   engage jointly  with these colleges in  undergraduate summer internships in this rapidly  advancing and  important technological area. As a starting point, we  have already established an agreement with Swathmore  College to participate in our undergraduate intern  program to act as a supplier of future  graduate students to the optics program at Princeton.",
