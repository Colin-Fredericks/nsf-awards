 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422288  Lobo     This award is to purchase a real-time vision system to assist research in three projects: 1) Classify Human Age from Faces; 2) Visual Gesture Recognition; and 3) Multi-frame Order Statistics in Image Processing.     In the first project, the research addresses the limited task of age classification of a facial image into a baby, young adult, and senior adult.  It addresses the difficult issues of age classification of faces that are engaged in activity, i.e., not simply mugshots.     The second project investigates performing gesture recognition based on motion information.  The current library of gestures contains seven gestures:  Left, Right, Up, Down, Rotate, Grab, and Stop.  It is proposed to extend the  method to 3-D gesture recognition.  A 3-D hand model using Generalized Cylinders, will be employed and motion parameters will be estimated to compute 3-D hand trajectories.  Gesture recognition becomes more realistic with a 3-D, rather than a 2-D, approach.     The third project deals with the real-time performance of multi-frame order statistics involving median filtering.  It is proposed to extend median and order statistic based filtering to 3-D by using spatio-temporal filtering (multiple successive images).  It is also proposed to extend methods for suppression of narrow-band (periodic) interference to 2-D (for images).",
