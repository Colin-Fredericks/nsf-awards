 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9511156  O'Donnell, Janis      Catecholamines are one of the basic groups of messenger molecules  in the central nervous system and are intimately involved in  transmitting information about the environment to the appropriate  brain regions in all animals.  The enzyme regulating catecholamine  biosynthesis is tyrosine hydroxylase.  An essential cofactor  required by tyrosine hydroxylase is tetrahydrobiopterin.  If  tetrahydrobiopterin levels are compromised, then catecholamine  biosynthesis is similarly compromised pointing to the reliance of  tyrosine hydroxylase on this cofactor.  Dr. O'Donnell has been  instrumental in identifying the enzyme responsible for the  production of tetrahydrobiopterin.  This enzyme is GTP  cyclohydrolase.  In the experiments supported by this award, Dr.  O'Donnell will examine the physical interaction of tyrosine  hydroxylase with GTP cyclohydrolase to better understand the  integral dependence of one enzyme on the other.  The structures  present in GTP cyclohydrolase that physically interact with  tyrosine hydroxylase will be examined using sophisticated molecular  techniques to alter the structure of the cyclohydrolase enzyme.   Further investigations will map the location of GTP cyclohydrolase  and tyrosine hydoxylase in neurons to establish whether they exist  as a complex or as individual molecules.  In addition, by genetic  screening  procedures, the genes encoding these enzymes will be  studied to determine if they are controlled by similar regulatory  elements providing for coregulation at the gene and protein level  in controlling the production of the essential cofactor,  tetrahydrobiopterin.  Catecholamines are crucial elements in normal  functioning of the central nervous system and understanding the  regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis is critical for future  understanding of neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's  disease.",
