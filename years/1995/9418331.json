 "awd_abstract_narration": "9418331  Muscatine         One of the most intriguing, and enigmatic phenomena in  the field of coral reef ecology is the symbiotic  relationship between the coral polyp and the nutrient  producing dinoflagellate that it hosts.  This relationship  is the key feature in the stability of coral reefs and many  of the organisms which reside there.       The objective of this project is to study the  translocation of  carbon from symbiotic dinoflagellates to  the coral host cells.  This will be achieved by a  revolutionary approach to studying this relationship, by  artificially altering the biochemical carbon pathways, and  evaluating the subsequent metabolism of the coral polyp and  the photosynthetic  capacities of the dinoflagellates.  This  shall give us new insights on the nutritional relationship  between the two.       Dr. Muscatine has a string of success with prior NSF  awards and is at the forefront in this field of study.  His  project will help to achieve two objectives: 1) further  contribute to our understanding of the role of coral  symbioses, which could potentially have biotechnological  value, and 2) provide another opportunity for collaborative  work with Russian scientist in U.S. laboratories.",
