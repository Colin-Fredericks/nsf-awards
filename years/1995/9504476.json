The objective  is to enhance our understanding of fundamental problems in both  subjects, including the K-theory of fields and rings of integers,  the nature of homotopy inverse limits, and the generating  hypothesis in stable homotopy theory.  (1) Mitchell will work on  the homotopy theoretic aspects of algebraic K-theory, focusing on  questions relating to the Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures for rings  of algebraic integers.  In particular, he will study further the  cohomology of the general linear group of such rings of integers.   (2) The principal aim of Goerss's research is to address the  question of computing homotopy inverse limits in general and in the  particular case of homotopy fixed points for the type of group  action that arises in algebraic K-theory.  Secondary to this main  project is a study of certain types of Hopf algebras, and a study  of the question of recovering homotopy invariants of a space from  its cochains.  (3) Devinatz will work on the chromatic point of  view in stable homotopy theory.  In particular, he is interested in  the circle of ideas surrounding Hopkins's chromatic splitting  conjecture and in its relevance to the generating hypothesis.       More basically, the projects of Mitchell, Goerss, and Devinatz  all involve the relationship between the field of algebra --  especially the theory of numbers -- and the more \"geometric\" field  of homotopy theory, which may be defined as the study of phenomena  that remain unchanged under continuous deformations.  Mitchell  plans to interpret number theoretic invariants in terms of homotopy  theory and then to use the techniques of homotopy theory to gain  new insights into number theory.  These insights might be difficult  to obtain using only algebraic techniques.  Goerss will be working  on a number of projects.  One involves developing techniques in  homotopy theory which should p rove useful in Mitchell's program.  Another of Goerss's projects turns the flow around -- namely, he  will attempt to understand certain homotopy invariants in a  completely algebraic way.  Devinatz will also use algebra to gain  insights into homotopy theory.  In Devinatz's project, the  algebraic framework is better understood; however, the algebra  involved is rather complicated.  Devinatz must therefore try to  extract enough information from the algebra to provide the desired  homotopy theoretic information.  All three investigators are also  interested in providing more expository accounts of the circle of  ideas surrounding their work; these accounts should make it easier  for graduate students to enter and master the field.  ***",
