 "awd_abstract_narration": "Finding dc operating points, steady state, and transient responses  of electronic circuits are essenntial tasks in electrical circuit  simulation and involve nonlinear differential/algebraic equations.   Traditional methods for solving such systems of equations often  fail, are difficult to converge, and, often cannot find all the  solutions.  Dr. Trajkovic will investigate the application of  homotopy methods to solving nonlinear equations describing power  electronic and switching circuits and power systems flow equations,  that traditionally pose simulation difficulties.  Experiments with  homotopies may lead to the development of better circuit simulation  tools and to better understanding of relationships between homotopy  methods and the behavior of nonlinear circuits.  Dr. Trajkovic will  spend three months with the Electrical Engineering Department at  the University of Wuppertal, Germany where she will collaborate  with Professor Wolfgang Mathis and his students.  Their \"Theory and  Computer Aided Design of Electronic Circuits \" group actively  pursues research in circuit theory and simulation.  This will be a  continuation of her research activities at Berkeley, with emphasis  on theoretical work based on experiments with various homotopies.    Interactive activities include:  teaching a graduate course in  \"Advanced Circuit Theory\" that will introduce students to  analytical results that provide insights and understanding of  complex behavior of electronic circuits; holding a workshop/seminar  series on \"Application of Homotopy Methods in Solving Engineering  Problems,\" with special emphasis on circuit simulation and solving  equations describing nonlinear circuits; and organizing informal  workshops where female students make presentations and get advice  about their research and career goals.",
