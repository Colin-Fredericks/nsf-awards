Prior  to the workshop, draft reports will be prepared and distributed to  the attendees.  The size of the group will be on the order of 30 to  40 and will include persons from countries in Europe and other  countries who actively involved with the national organizations  which develop testing standards.  The interaction of the U.S.  participants with those from other countries is particularly  important at this time.  It is noted that the practicing engineers  in Europe and Japan are making great progress toward implementing  the concepts of fracture mechanics into forensic engineering and  design practice, while this has been lagging in the U.S.  The  results of this workshop will lead to testing standards which will  be proposed to ASTM for their adoption.",
