 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project dramatically changes the way students learn and use  electronic circuits by creating a hands-on, integrated electronic  circuit prototyping facility.   The facility resonates with  important industrial and commercial themes in manufacturing  techniques, concurrent engineering, and competitiveness.   The  key ability of this facility is that it allows students the means  of easily designing a circuit board using high-functionality  devices, simulating the behavior and response to external  stimuli, and quickly producing a prototype etched/drilled circuit  board.   The cycle times and cost associated with producing a  high-quality prototype are greatly reduced and, for the first  time, are appropriate for undergraduate instructional purposes.   This project brings an existing, rudimentary facility to its full  potential and demonstrate to the educational community the merits  of giving students a new means of expressing their electronics  skills.   Included in this project are four design workstations  with appropriate software, an upgrade for an existing mill/drill  machine, and various industry-standard tools.  The upgrade of  this facility enables a higher student throughput and brings a  new level of electronic-related instruction to eight core  curriculum courses in this division with over 200  electrical-specialty students.   These students are gaining the  ability to construct a far higher level of real-world circuits,  opening up new possibilities in solving system level problems.",
