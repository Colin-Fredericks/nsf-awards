State University to  pursue with Dr. Woo-Seung Kim, Department of Mechanical  Engineering, Hanyang University, Korea, for 24 months, a program  of cooperative research on inverse heat transfer problems.  The  goal of this collaboration is to make a systematic study of  inverse heat transfer problems of (1) forced and natural  convection, (2) radiation in a semitransparent absorbing,  emitting, and scattering medium, and (3) interaction of radiation  with conduction, with the objective of developing improved,  accurate methods of analysis for estimating various  thermophysical properties of materials, unknown surface, inlet,  and source conditions from simulated transfer heat transfer  experiments.    The results from this study should provide a better understanding  of the capabilities and limitations of the use of inverse methods  of analysis for estimating thermophysical properties of materials  and unknown surface or interior conditions.  Potential  applications of inverse problems arise in many fields of science  and technology.  Their usefulness in practical applications lies  in the fact that they enable researchers to conduct experimental  investigations under conditions encountered directly during the  operation of engineering devices.  The collaborators have  considerable complementary research experience in the field of  their proposed project.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which  seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and  Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
