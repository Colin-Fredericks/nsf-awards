 "awd_abstract_narration": "9322669  Popek  This project will develop and prototype concepts and techniques  needed to support network access to users even after periodic  disconnection of user workstations from the network.  More  specifically, the project will develop a prototype based on the  idea of pre-loading the workstations (and portable computers)  with files that are most likely to be accessed during  disconnected mode.  In addition, the project will develop  software support tools to resynchronize files on the portable  computers with file serves upon reconnect.  Disconnection must be  treated as a normal, desirable mode of operation, rather than as  an error condition.  Even after days of disconnection from the  network, the disconnected machine should be able to operate and  deliver most of the functionality associated with the network  environment, including access to shared network files and other  resources.  Providing this capability around the clock,  regardless of the geographic location will make a significant  impact on the future of computing environments and collaborative  work environments.  ***",
