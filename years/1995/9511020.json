 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511020  Adams    Nerve cells communicate with each other by means of chemical  signals called neurotransmitters and neurohormones. The arrival  of electrical impulses at nerve endings release tiny amounts of  neurotransmitters acting locally or much larger amounts of  neurohormones acting at longer distances; both stimulate the  electrical activity in neighboring nerve cells. The release of  these chemical signals depends on the brief entry of calcium to  nerve terminals, a process that is highly regulated by \"calcium  channels\". Small amounts of calcium enter for neurotransmitter  release, whereas larger and longer periods of calcium entry are  necessary for the release of hormones. These differences are to a  large extent dictated by variations in the properties of  different calcium channels. Dr. Adams and his colleagues are  working to define the properties of calcium channels in different  types of nerve cells, ranging from motoneurons to neuroendocrine  cells, using a combination of electrophysiology and pharmacology.  The kinetics of calcium channel opening and closing as well as  their sensitivities to different drugs and toxins will be used to  classify them into different groups and to associated them with  different functions in nerve cells. Potential applications of  these studies are the development of pharmaceuticals and pest  control agents.",
