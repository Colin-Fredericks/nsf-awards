 "awd_abstract_narration": "As computers become ubiquitous, they are increasingly used  in  safety critical environments. Typical safety  applications are control systems,  monitoring systems and  communication systems. Any failure of such computer  systems  may cause a great financial loss, environmental disaster or  even the  loss of lives.  The  potential high cost  associated with an incorrect operation  of  these systems  has created a demand for a rigorous framework in  which  various design alternatives can be formally specified and  rigorously analyzed  and tested before implementation. It is  commonly believed that future safety  critical systems uill  be more complex due to increased demands on their  functionalities, as well as, the size of the problem  domain.  Thus, it will be  difficult to analyze and  test the correctness without  computer-aided  tools. One  common aspect of all safety critical  systems is that they  must  respond under stringent realtime constraints.  That  is, their correctness  depends not only on how concurrent  components interact, but also on the time at  which these  interactions occur.  These systems are costly  to  prototype, requiring careful prediction of timing  properties  before  implementation and evaluation of design  alternatives.  Thus, it is important to  develop a formal  framework that supports automatic and computer-aided  analysis  and testing to effectively cope with increased  complexity.    The major thrust  of this research is to develop analysis  and testing techniques for timing  properties, and to  implement supporting software tools based on real-time  temporal logic and state machine models. The proposed tools  will provide an  environment in which software engineers can  generate tests from behavioral  specifications and  performance requirement constraints and simulate and test  to validate the specification.",
