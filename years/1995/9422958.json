 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Jeffrey A. Cina at the Department of Chemistry of the   University of Chicago is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for theoretical research which   interprets and predicts phenomena associated with time-resolved optical   excitations.  Work is being carried out on several different topics, all   involving matter in the condensed phase. A major theme of this work is   the study of coherently organized states of matter. One kind of coherence   involves spatially localized states where, for example, left handed and   right handed geometries, or conformations, are distinguished; other kinds   of coherences involve the vibrational motions of the nuclei. Another   major theme of the work is the study of solvent effects on the   excitations of molecules in solution.   Ultra-short pulses of laser light provide a powerful means to place   matter into unusual states, far from thermal equilibrium. These states   may have unusual chemical or material properties quite different from   those of condensed matter in its more normal states. The work under this   grant involves theoretical studies which explore the properties of these   unusual states as well as how they may be prepared and how they may be   detected. The work is being carried out in close and direct contact with   people who are making related experimental studies. In this way, the   understanding coming from the theoretical work is being applied, in the   near term, to the analysis and interpretation of experimental data.",
