 "awd_abstract_narration": "9505687  Sack    Stomata consist of two guard cells surrounding a pore that  regulates gas exchange through the aerial plant epidermis. Little  is known about the genes that regulate stomatal patterning,  determination and differentiation. Two recessive Arabidopsis  mutants have been isolated, too many mouths (tmm) and four lips  (flp), each with extra adjacent stomata. Both affect stomatal  production and determination more than patterning or  differentiation. ttm appears to affect both precursor cell  formation and activity and may be an important regulator of  stomatal production. The research proposed has three objectives  overall. First, to understand the phenotypes better, Dr. Sack will  attempt to: a) isolate new alleles, b) characterize the  distribution of the stomatal phenotypes throughout the plant, c)  determine whether tmm and flp induce ectopic expression of stomatal  genes, d) analyze the extent of pore development in mutants, e)  determine whether substomatal placement and size is affected, and  f) characterize cell lineages involved in the development of wild  type stomata and of stomatal clusters. A second objective is to  isolate new mutants and loci affecting stomatal development. The  third major objective is to do fine mapping to choose appropriate  cloning strategies. These mutants are likely to help answer basic  questions of plant cell development such as how cells are selected  for specific fates, as well as how differentiation is initiated and  executed. In the long term, knowledge of the genetics and molecular  biology of stomatal development would be quite valuable given the  importance of stomata for plant productivity.  ***",
