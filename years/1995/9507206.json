To this end, a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches will be used to characterize the interaction of specific forms of rab7 with the actin cytoskeleton.  The yeast two hybrid system will be employed to identify interacting partners of rab7 as a corollary approach.  In addition, an in vitro assay system will be developed to study late endocytic membrane transport.  This latter analysis will be extended by the development of a permeabilized system which examines the mechanisms of interaction between rab7 and its partners.  This project is a Faculty Early Career Development Award and also entail an education plan.  In the Education portion of this project an approach is developed for active learning in the undergraduate classroom.  In addition, introduction to career-training programs will be provided to the students to make them better suited to the job market.  Finally, the project includes outreach to pre-college educators.  %%%  This project will examine the mechanisms by which components are directed to specific locations within the cell.  It will help explain how molecules such as food enter the cell and end up in the correct location for digestion.  The education plan of this project will serve to strengthen the undergraduate education at the awardee's institution, and to make the undergraduates at the institution better suited to the job market.  ***",
