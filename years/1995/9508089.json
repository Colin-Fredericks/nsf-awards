Participation will provide the opportunity to address important  problems in the stratigraphic relations and dating of the Paleogene strata on Seymour  Island and to field check the new 1:20,000 topographic map that is being prepared by the  USGS.          The sedimentary strata on Seymour Island are part of the only exposed Upper  Cretaceous to Lower Tertiary marine sequence in Antarctica.  The Cretaceous-Tertiary  succession was deposited in an ensialic back-arc basin related to the development of the  mid-Mesozoic to mid-Cenozoic active plate margin of the Antarctic Peninsula.  Seymour  Island strata range in age between Late Campanian and middle(?) Eocene to earliest(?)  Oligocene.  These poorly consolidated sedimentary rocks contain a diverse and  exceptionally preserved invertebrate fauna, a diverse microflora, and a variety of  vertebrates, including marsupials.  Fieldwork (to be supported by the Argentine Antarctic  Institute in the 1994-95 season) will be directed toward: resolving the complex  stratigraphic relations of the Paleogene units on Seymour Island; collection of tuff beds  for radiometric dating, and petrologic and geochemical analysis; and sequence analysis of  the Paleogene succession.        This award is to support travel to Buenos Aires to join the Argentine Antarctic  Institute's geology project, travel to confer with the USGS about the results of field  checking of the topographic map, and laboratory studies on samples collected in the  course of the field season.  Specifically, the lab objectives are to:  1) date the ash beds in  order to provide absolute age control for sequences that lack calcareous and siliceous  microfossil assemblages; and 2) establish the geochemistry of the ash beds to assess  contemporaneous volcanic activity and magmatic evol ution of the source region.        The results will provide the stratigraphic framework for on-going paleontological  projects on Paleogene strata, radiometric data in support of paleontological ages and  sequence analysis, and characteristics of the magmatic activity in the source region of the  sediments.",
