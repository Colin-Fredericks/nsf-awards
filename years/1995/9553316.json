The catalytic agent for  NCUR's various programs in support of undergraduate research is its  annual, three-day conference that brings together some 1200  students and 400 faculty representing about 300 colleges and  universities from almost every stat in the nation.  In addition to  being the primary showcase for the intellectual achievements of  American's undergraduates, this conference provides a unique  opportunity to build communities of scholars.  In particular, NCUR  has a strong commitment to facilitating the networking of minority  undergraduate scholars with each other and, to help meet that goal,  NCUR has an avowed policy of providing scholarship support for  minority students with financial need to attend the annual  conference.  Aided by continuing funds from the National Science  Foundation, scholarships at the last six conferences have risen  sharply from 33 to 115 and total attendance by those designating  themselves as being of minority ethnicity now approaches 20  percent.  The funding requested in this proposal will permit NCUR  to continue to actively seek out wide participation of minority  students and faculty (in the sciences and engineering) at the  annual National Conference.  It will permit NCUR to develop  workshops and other activities at the annual conferences of special  interest to these participants.  And, finally, it will allow NCUR  to develop a database to assess the effectiveness of undergraduate  research participation in influencing the career choices of  minority students.",
