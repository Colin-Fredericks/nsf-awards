 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is introducing computations into organic, physical,  and biochemistry courses for chemistry majors to train students  to visualize and understand molecular structure, learn how to  write programs for data analysis, and appreciate the dynamic  nature of molecules and their relationship to chemical  reactivity.   Students are applying molecular mechanics and semi-  empirical molecular orbital methods to organic and small  biological molecules, solving physical chemistry problems through  computer programming, and observing the molecular dynamics of  proteins.    Specifically, organic chemistry students are  studying the conformational equilibria of substituted  cyclohexanes, nucleophilic addition to alpha, beta unsaturated  carbonyls, and electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions.    Physical chemistry students are solving a particle-in-a-box  problem, examining the kinetics of chain and oscillating  reactions, and predicting the infrared spectrum of acetic acid.    Biochemistry students are examining the allosteric transition of  hemoglobin and the induced fit mechanism of carboxypeptidase A,  and comparing nucleic acid structures.   Advanced courses are  being developed to address several aspects of computational  chemistry, such as molecular modeling and dynamics of proteins.    Four advanced graphics workstations provide hands-on experience  for students with computers and programs actually used in major  research laboratories.   The program greatly reduces the gap  between undergraduate education and what is actually done in  academic and industrial laboratories.",
