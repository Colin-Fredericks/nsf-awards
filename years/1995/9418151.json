Upwelling  warm  deep  water  covers  the  Amundsen   and  Bellingshausen   shelves  and  was   found   to   deliver  significant  amounts of heat to the sea ice and  fringing  ice  shelves.  The regional precipitation is  heavy,  and  has historically maintained a perennial ice cover.    However, within the last few years satellite images  have  shown  that the ice has been receding dramatically,  with  large  areas of open water persisting through the  winter  in  sectors  that  earlier had been  ice-covered.   These  anomalous  ice  distributions are  likely  to  have  been  accompanied  by  altered surface  water  properties,  and  possibly changes in the deep vertical circulation.  There  are  indications that the conditions favoring a reduction  in  the sea ice may migrate westward toward the Ross Sea,  and  may  have influenced a gradual wapming  over  recent  decades  on  the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula.  The  current  project will investigate the production  of  shelf  water  and  deep water through  interactions  with  coastal  polynyas and floating ice, and  make  use  of  a  large   body   of  ancillary  data  on  the  geochemical,  biological, and cryospheric environment.    The  project made use of the R/V Nathaniel B.  Palmer  in  two  cruises:  one in the late austral summer  1993-1994,  and  a  subsequent  cruise in September  and  October  to  observe late winter conditions.  ***",
