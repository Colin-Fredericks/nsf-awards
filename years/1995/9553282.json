 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Young Engineering and Science Scholars (YESS) Summer Science  Camp, Jointly sponsored by the Marquette University College of  Engineering and the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), provides  enrichment experiences in science, engineering and mathematics.   The program offers a 4-week camp on Marquette's campus for 48  middle school students, plus academic-year activities at Marquette  and in four area middle schools.  The summer science camp students  explore \"The Wonderful World of Robotics\" through hands-on  discovery activities and demonstrations in a curriculum designed to  provide students with an integrated view of engineering with  emphasis on the underlying fundamentals shared by all engineering  disciplines.  Students culminate their summer experience by  constructing a LEGO/TC logo robot to accomplish a specified task  based on their research and learning activities.  Academic year  follow-up activities include the monthly \"Saturday Science  Colloquia\" at the MU College of Engineering and biweekly \"School  Science Clubs\" at each of the four middle schools from which the  summer science campers are recruited.  Students who attend either  or both of these follow-up activities may also receive assistance  with individual science projects of their choice and participate in  a mini science fair during Open House at Marquette's College of  Engineering.  Both summer and academic year programming provide  career exploration, college planning, and personal development  components designed to inform and motivate middle school students  regarding careers in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics.  ***",
