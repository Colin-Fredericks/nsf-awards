 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New Jersey Consortium for Advanced Technological Education  proposes to restructure engineering technology education beginning  in grade eleven in secondary school through the associate degree  with articulation with baccalaureate institutions.  Just as the  engineer of today must be knowledgeable in more than one area and  must be able to learn other fields quickly, the diversified  technological environment of today requires a new engineering  technician who has a thorough understanding of the mechanics,  electronics, and computer hardware and software that drive the  modern workplace.  In engineering, one response to the need for  cross-disciplinary knowledge was the creation of a \"mechatronics\"  engineering discipline.         In engineering technology, Mecomtronics, a new program to be  created under this plan, will respond to the widespread demand for  a multifunctional engineering technician.  As the result of an  intensive planning process, the New Jersey Consortium for Advanced  Technological Education (a partnership of community colleges,  baccalaureate institutions and school districts) will establish a  center for engineering technology education that will:         create and implement an integrated Mecomtronics (MEchanical/       COMputer/teleCOMmunications/elecTRONlCS) Associate Degree       program;         develop and integrate curriculum and instructional materials       based on an interdisciplinary, project-centered, collaborative       learning approach to instruction;         restructure existing engineering technology programs;         expand existing Tech Prep relationships with high schools and       articulation agreements with baccalaureate institutions;         establish a meaningful       business/industry education professional association       partnership;         incorporate quality principles into engineering technology       curriculum;         develop and implement strategies for faculty professional       development;         adapt and develop model p rograms and strategies to increase       enrollment and success of students, particularly those from       underrepresented populations;         implement an electronic and print engineering technology       education communications network;         enhance the professional status of technician careers;         evaluate the impact of Center activities on engineering       technology education.       At the end of the five-year project, not only will the  Consortium have created a new engineering technology discipline  that responds to the needs of industry and students, but it will  also have had a profound positive impact on the entire field of  engineering technology education.  In each year of the project,  interrelated curriculum, materials development, faculty development  and student outreach activities will result in achievements that  are measurable and sustainable.",
