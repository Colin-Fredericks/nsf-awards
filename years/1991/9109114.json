 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major challenge for parallel computation is to use real hardware              with real software to solve real application problems. This research            will extend a runtime support system, chare kernel, to run real                 computation problems on real parallel machines.  Experience has shown           the feasibility and advantages of a runtime support system.  Such a             system can provide a machine-independent programming environment for            parallel computations.  More important, it has the function of dynamic          scheduling and communication management, as well as abstraction of              interaction between parallel actions, realizing a powerful virtual              machine.                                                                        The project will investigate how much benefit can be obtained by using          the chare kernel system, especially for applications with irregular             and unpredictable features.  It will implement a number of substantial          applications on the chare kernel for comparison with implementation             without runtime support.  It will study the compilation technique to            translate high-level languages into the chare kernel language, and              compare this approach to implementation of compiler directly on                 parallel machines.  It will also investigate an automatic program               partitioning scheme to further relax the burden of users or compilers.          The goal of this research is to make parallel programming powerful              (able to handle most application problems), and able to utilize the             parallel system resources effectively.",
