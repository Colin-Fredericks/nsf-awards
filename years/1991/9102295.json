 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaboration between George                            Smoot of the space sciences group at the University of                          California-Berkeley and Sergio Torres of the astrophysics                       group at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogota,                                Colombia.  The project aims to study atmospheric                                conditions and preliminary radioastronomical measurements,                      in conjunction with the NSF-supported project on low                            frequency measurements of the cosmic microwave background                       radiation (CMBR).                                                                                                                                               By looking at the spectral distribution of the CMBR, the                        researchers can study the process that took place in an                         early epoch of the universe when the mechanisms that                            triggered galaxy formation must have left an imprint in                         the radiation.  Data from a site near the equator will                          provide maximum observation of the galactic plane.  This                        project will map the galactic emission in orthogonal                            linear polarizations, in order to produce more precise                          maps than exist today.  Besides acquiring galactic                              intensity data, the researchers will select sites for                           future polarization measurements requiring correlation of                       data taken at different sites.  The U.S. group has                              developed the radiometric technique for the CMBR                                measurements to be used in the project.  The Colombian                          group will provide the infrastructure for the project in                        Colombia, as well as facilities and access to proposed                          sites for collecting data to improve galactic models.",
