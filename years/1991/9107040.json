 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the author's well known work on time,                          interaction and performance in groups and on the flow of work in                technologically enhanced groups.  The researcher conducts a set                 of experiments that deal with the consequences for group                        interaction and task performance, of variations in communication                channels and modalities within work groups.  The research                       compares face to face groups with groups doing comparable tasks                 in which communication is computer-mediated.  The theory guiding                this work contains the assumption that various forms of                         technological enhancement in such groups simultaneously reduce                  some barriers to effective group performance and impose others,                 and that they do so by altering the informational, temporal, and                interactional processes by which the group does its work.  The                  empirical basis underlying this theoretical rationale, however,                 consists of findings from only a very thin base of research                     studies, some of which have serious methodological flaws.  This                 research conducts a series of experiments that are robust and                   replicable.",
