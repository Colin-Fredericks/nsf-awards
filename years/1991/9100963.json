 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site grant.                   The award permits undergraduate students to participate in a                    research program in the materials field under the supervision of                faculty members actively engaged in research.  The grant involves               research experiences for six undergraduate students at the                      University of Houston, Texas Southern University, University of                 Houston-Downtown Campus, and Sam Houston State University.  Texas               Southern is a historically black university.  The goal is to have               half of the students involved be minority.  Students from the                   various campuses meet monthly to discuss progress and present                   results in seminars.  Students first attend training classes to                 acquire required skills specific to individual research projects,               such as operation of equipment and safety procedures.                           Thereafter, students elect to participate on individual research                projects under supervision of a faculty member.  Typical topics                 for research include: electron transport in semiconducting and                  superconducting materials, study of thin films using energy                     dispersive spectroscopy in a scanning electron microscope,                      chemical beam epitaxy of thin films, characterization of thin                   films using infrared spectroscopy and electron spin resonance.                  The program enhances current research activities as well as                     adding to the number of scientifically trained individuals.  It                 is hoped that this hands-on experience will serve as a stimulus                 to attract and retain highly-gifted students into careers in                    teaching and research.",
