 "awd_abstract_narration": "The history of sea level is one of the most important                   paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic parameters.  Knowledge of                   this variable constrains the history of ice sheet growth and                    decay, and its relationship to climate forcing.  Likewise the                   history of CO2 in the atmosphere is also critical to our                        understanding of climate.  This proposal requests support to                    address both of these issues.  This project will use samples                    recovered from the coral reef terraces of Santo Island, Vanuatu,                in order to obtain a high-resolution record of sea level history                and initial 14C/12C ratios for the last 30,000 years.  The                      samples result from collaboration of the PIs with an ongoing                    project of drilling on Santo Island led by scientists from                      ORSTROM in New Caledonia. The costs of the drilling are provided                by ORSTROM.  The research proposed here is important because it                 will help to constrain the history of sea level during the last                 deglaciation and it will further refine our 14C chronology during               this interval.",
