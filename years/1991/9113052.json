 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue and elaborate an extensive electron                  spin resonance (ESR) dating program directed toward age                         determination of significant sites in Europe, western Asia and                  southern Africa which yield important hominid skeletal remains                  and/or occupation occurrences reflecting varied adaptations and                 behaviors of Pleistocene (or still older) hominid populations.                  This ESR dating program at McMaster University (Hamilton,                       Ontario) is the only such operation of its kind in North America.               Age determination of Pleistocene hominid skeletal samples and of                residues of occupation sites is critical to diverse on-going                    investigations directed at the elucidation of aspects of hominid                evolutionary biology and phylogenesis, past cultural adaptations,               inter-site correlations and the evolution of past environmental                 circumstances in temporally-delineated frameworks.                                                                                                              Due to the abundance of bone/dental material in archaeological                  and paleontological sites the ESR method is particularly                        applicable to many important Pleistocene occurrences, and for                   ages up to several million years ago.  The precision of the                     method is approximately %3 - %5.  The method has been                           increasingly successfully applied by this laboratory at a                       diversity of Middle and Upper Pleistocene situations in Europe                  and western Asia and, preliminarily, in southern Africa, and                    provides an important resource for US archaeologists.",
