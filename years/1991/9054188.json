 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-week workshop (August 11-23, 1991) in laser/electro-optic                 technology is being offered for four-year college teachers located              primarily in the Appalachian Region.  Participants receive                      instruction and training in the theory and principles of lasers,                laser safety, electro-optics, and the design and construction of                lasers.  Special attention is given to the use of lasers in                     advanced undergraduate laboratory experiments.  Applications in                 basic science, analytical chemistry, medicine, communications, and              manufacturing will be illustrated in field trips to the Oak Ridge               National Laboratory, the Oak Ridge Methodist Medical Center, the                University of Tennessee, the Thompson Cancer Survival Center, the               Atom Sciences corporation, and in a local manufacturing plant and               local fiber optic communications company.                                                                                                                       Material for this proposed workshop has originated from a course                in laser/electro-optic technology developed by the Project                      Directory and taught at Pellissippi State Technical Community                   College.  Additional relevant material has arisen from innovative               laboratory experiments developed at West Virginia Wesleyan College.             Motivation for offering this workshop comes from a survey conducted             by the Laser Technology Center which showed that a need exists for              training and educating persons in laser/electro-optic technology.//",
