 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project considers the problem of decreasing the                       probability of error of M-ary continuous-phase modulation (CPM)                 schemes by means of channel coding.  It is argued that the usual                technique involving an external binary convolutional encoder is                 unnatural, and it exploits only part of the coding gain.  This                  project is based on a new solution, which aims to obtain a larger               coding gain for the same decoding complexity.  The method is by                 means of M-ary convolutional channel encoders (CE) that explicitly              use the state information of the CPM scheme that they feed.  The                ability to use this method lies in the model for CPM, which                     consists of a linear sequential circuit denoted continuous-phase                encoder (CPE) followed by a memoryless modulator (MM).  Since the               CPE is M-ary, one can feed-back the content of its memory units                 and use it explicitly in the CE which is also M-ary and linear                  over the ring of integers modulo M.  Thus the CE has its own                    memory units and those shared with the CPE.  This symbiosis                     increases the constraint length of the CE without increasing the                overall number of states.  Codes that are more powerful than the                usual ones are obtained without increasing the decoding                         complexity.  Moreover, this solution is not constrained to CPM                  schemes whose input alphabet's size M is a power of 2.  The                     research on ring codes is of interest in its own.  Various recent               results are a clear indication that ring and group codes are of                 great importance for nonbinary modulation schemes.",
