 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to develop a                                  systematic approach to uncertainty modeling from                                experimental data for robust control.  In the past                              decade, theoretical developments in robust control have                         lead to more rigorous and applicable design techniques                          which allow the explicit incorporation of plant                                 uncertainty into the problem formulation \u01311,2,3,4!.                             These developments provide a fresh approach that can                            be exploited to control complex systems and achieve                             performance specifications which were unthinkable                               several years ago.  The key link currently missing                              between these theoretical developments and their                                application in industry is a systematic approach to the                         generation of performance and uncertainty                                       descriptions.  The importance of accurate                                       characterizations of uncertainty descriptions was vividly                       shown in the design of controllers for an experimental                          flexible structure \u01315!.  Controllers synthesized for                            \"accurate\" descriptions of the plant uncertainty yielded                        significant improvements in system performance when                             compared with other less accurate uncertainty                                   descriptions.                                                                   The proposed research will develop a methodology for                            attributing the error between theoretical system model                          and experimental data to uncertainty and noise model                            in a linear fractional framework which is compatible                            with the structure value mu-methodology.  These same                            techniques can also be employed to develop                                      performance descriptions in for this framework.  The                            mu-framework will then be used to analyze and                                   synthesize complex system controllers with these new                            performance and uncertainty descriptions.  The                                  improved modeling of a physical system for the                                  purpose of control design will provide a two fold                               benefit: improved robustness properties and closed-loop                         system performance of the controller.",
