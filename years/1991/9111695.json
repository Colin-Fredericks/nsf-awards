 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Houston Gene-Server was made public in 1988 as                an electronic mail server for Genbank entries.  At that time,                   such a service was not available elsewhere (now Intelligenetics                 is also providing a similar service).  Over time, support for the               PIR database was added, and various analytical software packages                were also added to the distribution system.  Today, PIR entries                 are updated quarterly, GenBank weekly, and software as available.               GeneServer also provides anonymous ftp access to its contents.                  The Gene-Server has now been operating for 26 months and has                    responded to more than 5000 requests for information from                       researchers around the world.  With additional support, the                     system will be expanded with additional disk space and additional               services to meet the needs of the molecular biology community.",
