 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this research is to understand the cell                biology of higher plant responses to environmental stress.  The                 model system for investigation is the heat shock response of the                aleurone layer of barley grains.  The cells of this tissue are                  normally dedicated to protein secretion; however, heat shock                    dramatically redirects their cellular activities.  The synthesis                of secretory proteins is abruptly arrested when the tissue is                   subjected to heat shock, yet the synthesis of nonsecretory proteins             continues.  This is accomplished by the selective destabilization               of otherwise stable secretory protein mRNAs.  Heat shock also                   causes the loss of endoplasmic reticulum lamellar structures upon               which secretory protein mRNAs are translated; only small fragments              of ER remain.  This appears to provide the discriminatory mechanism             for selectively stopping the synthesis of secretory proteins, as                nonsecretory protein mRNAs are not translated by ER-bound                       ribosomes.  The work proposed investigates the molecular and                    cellular basis for these heat shock-induced events.  In vitro                   translation reactions supplemented with barley microsomes will be               used to investigate whether the ER fragments of heat-shocked                    aleurone cells can serve as sites for the translation and                       translocation of proteins.  The ER lamellae are supported by a                  cytoskeleton.  In other organisms, the cytoskeleton has been shown              to be unstable during heat shock.  Immunofluorescence microscopy                will be used to investigate the effect of heat shock on                         cytoskeletal elements of barley aleurone cells.  Heat-induced                   shifts in the buoyant densities of ER membranes have been observed;             these will be investigated by assaying protein:lipid ratios of                  microsomes isolated on sucrose density gradients.  Secretory                    protein mRNAs contain secretory signals that direct them to be                  translated on ER lamellae.  Aleurone cells transformed with signal              sequence - reporter gene constructs will be used to determine of                the presence of such a signal is sufficient to render the mRNA                  unstable during heat shock.                                                                                                                                     These experiments should provide insights into the cell biology of              ER, as well as reveal mechanisms for regulating protein expression              during heat shock.  These efforts will ultimately build a better                understanding of how plants respond and adapt to stress.",
