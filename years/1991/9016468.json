 "awd_abstract_narration": "Randomized algorithms consume a valuable resource:  uniformly                   distributed random bits.  One of the primary focuses of this work is            to develop general techniques for designing algorithms which do not             use as many random bits.                                                        A pseudo-random generator stretches a short random string into a much           longer string that looks totally random to any polynomial time                  adversary.  A pseudo-random generator is the central component in a             secure private key cryptosystem, and can be used to conserve on the             number of random bits used by Monte Carlo algorithms.  Having shown             how to construct a pseudo-random generator from any one way function,           the investigator plans to develop constructions for even more                   efficient pseudo-random generators.                                             A typical and important example of a counting problem is to estimate            the number of truth assignments that satisfy a given boolean formula.           A polynomial time randomized algorithm has been designed for this               problem, and a polynomial time deterministic algorithm will be sought.          Recently, the theory of program checking has developed which is a               useful supplement to program verification and program testing. This             theory, which provides a way of computing a function f and verifying            the correctness of the answer using a possibly partially faulty                 program P that supposedly computes f.  This theory, which has been              successfully applied to a variety of algebraic problems, will be                extended to other applications.   //",
