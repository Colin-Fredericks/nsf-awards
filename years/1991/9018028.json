 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines experiments to characterize a recently                   identified protein that appears to be directly involved in the                  induction of plant cell wall expansion.  The protein will be                    purified in quantities sufficient to raise rabbit polyclonal                    antibodies.  The antibodies will be used (i) to identify the                    anatomical and cytological location of the protein, (ii) to                     quantify developmental changes in the protein, and (iii) to test                whether this or homologous proteins are involved in growth of                   other organs and other species.  The purified protein will be                   assayed for enzymatic activities and binding properties that                    might provide clues about the biochemical mechanism of its                      wall-extension activity.  Cell walls will also be analyzed for                  evidence of post-translational modification (e.g. thiolreduction                or protein phosphorylation) of this or other proteins, under the                influence of auxin and other growth-control agents.   The results               will test the hypothesis that plant cell expansion is                           developmentally regulated by this protein, which appears to be                  the first endogenous protein shown to cause expansion of isolated               plant cell walls.                                                                                                                                               The growth of plants is controlled primarily by the relaxation                  and expansion of the polymeric wall.  The precise molecular                     structure of the plant cell wall and the molecular mechanism of                 cell wall relaxation and expansion is not known.  The                           identification of a specific protein that can induce these                      processes in isolated cell walls provides strong evidence that                  the protein is directly involved in this phenomenon.  The                       purification and characterization provides for the first time the               ability to directly investigate the molecular mechanism of cell                 enlargement.  Understanding the mechanism of cell wall loosening                may also provide new information about the molecular architecture               of the plant cell wall.//",
