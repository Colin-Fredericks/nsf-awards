 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in field theory                        between Dr. B. L. Hu, Professor of Physics at the University                    of Maryland and Dr. E. Calzetta, Dr. J. P. Paz, research                        physicists of the Institute for Astronomy and Space Physics                     (IAFE), Argentina.  This collaboration has produced a series                    of significant research papers in the areas of non-equilibrium                  statistical mechanics, quantum field theory in curved                           spacetime and early cosmology.  Their recent  work in                           stochastic field theory has developed further these                             lines of investigation which now enables them to tackle                         basic problems of theoretical physics such as noise and                         fluctuation in inflationary cosmology, decoherence in quantum                   cosmology, and gravitational entropy of the universe.                                                                                                           The work in the next two years will be a continuation in the                    development of the statistical and stochastic quantum field                     theories and their application to basic problems in quantum                     mechanics, gravitation and relativistic cosmology.  Dr.                         Calzetta and Dr. Paz are capable young researchers from IAFE,                   the center of gravity research in Argentina.  Their training                    and background make it possible to benefit directly from, and                   contribute effectively to this research.  The University of                     Maryland has been an important international research center                    in relativity and gravitation physics.",
