 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California - Los Angeles will coordinate                      a multidisciplinary workshop to bring together, for the                         very first time, biologists, mathematicians, engineers,                         geologists, and computer animation specialists who work                         with three-dimensional pattern formation and models of                          aggregation.  Examples of three-dimensional aggregations                        include fish schools, insect swarms, and molecules within a                     crystal.  Aggregation is a pervasive behavioral phenomenon                      within most animal taxa.  Gaining knowledge about density,                      cohesion, and spacing and movements of individuals within                       three-dimensional groups has been hampered by the visual                        complexity of these aggregations and the lack of tools and                      techniques to analyze interactions within them.  Three-                         dimensional aggregations are also of interest in several                        non-biological disciplines as well.  The workshop will                          bring together thirty investigators from various disci-                         plines and computer specialists to present information on                       their individual research interests, and to explore whether                     tools and techniques from other fields can be used to                           develop new cross-disciplinary collaboration to advance the                     study of aggregations.  Results of the workshop will be                         broadly available and form the foundation for future                            research.",
