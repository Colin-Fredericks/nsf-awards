 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in cell biology to                     be conducted by Manuel Diaz of the University of Chicago and                    two counterpart scientists in Buenos Aires, Irma Slavutsky                      and Irene Larripa of the Academy of Medicine.  They will                        carry out collaborative studies on the molecular analysis of                    mouse and human cell lines that contain deletions of a                          certain genomic region, including a cluster of genes belonging                  to the interferon gene family.  The main purpose of the study                   will be to analyze the deletions at the molecular level and                     to clone and sequence their breakpoint junctions.  They will                    determine the size of the deletions, many of which are                          submicroscopic and study the mechanism by which these                           deletions occur.  The study will elucidate basic mechanisms                     of mutagenesis that may be involved in all kinds of genetic                     processes:  somatic or germinal mutations related to the                        origin of congenital or acquired disease, somatic or germinal                   spontaneous neutral mutations without pathologic consequences,                  or normal evolutionary processes.                                                                                                                               The strength of Drs. Slavutsky and Larripa's group, is the                      microscopic cytogenetic analysis of chromosome abnormalities                    in cancer cells and experimental mammalian cytogenetics.                        They will develop the methods of analysis of DNA rearrangements                 associated with the chromosome abnormalities detected in                        their studies.  Their interaction with Dr Diaz`s laboratory                     will help them to develop this capability, and at the same                      time will allow both groups to coordinate their efforts in                      the study of the molecular basis of chromosome rearrangements                   in mammalian cells  They have in their laboratory the                           necessary equipment to perform DNA extraction from mammalian                    cells and to perform Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA.                     This is in addition to all the tissue culture, optical and                      photographic equipment and facilities necessary for cytogenetic                 analysis.  The strength of the University of Chicago laboratory                 is the analysis of DNA rearrangements generated by such                         chromosomal abnormalities, the identification and cloning of                    the DNA sequences located at the translocation breakpoints,                     and the identification and characterization of genes affected                   by these rearrangements.  Because these two laboratories                        complement each other so well, the mutual benefits of this                      collaboration are evident.",
