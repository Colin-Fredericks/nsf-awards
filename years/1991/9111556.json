 "awd_abstract_narration": "To date most of the research on the juvenile justice system has                 focused on individual-level case processing, examining variations               within a given jurisdiction that could be explained by either case              or defendant-specific characteristics.  Probably the most common                topic has emphasized how \"extra-legal\" factors such as race, social             class, and gender influence court decisioning.  This tradition of               work has added substantially to our understanding of juvenile                   justice and the workings of the court.  The picture, however, is                necessarily incomplete.  Despite the vast number of studies on the              micro causes of juvenile justice processing (i.e., within court                 variation), there are few efforts that have examined its macro                  causes; that is, differences among court systems that can be                    attributed to the characteristics of the communities in which they              reside.                                                                                                                                                         The study being undertaken by Dr. Sampson represents a major                    advance in current research on official reactions to juvenile                   delinquency by shifting from micro level concerns to macro level                interests in examining how environmental and structural factors                 affect the operations of the juvenile courts.  Specifically, the                research asks the question: how do features of the community--                  especially urbanization, population density, heterogeneity,                     concentration of poverty, and court-organizational structure--                  influence rates of referral, formal petitioning, secure pre-                    disposition detention, release, and placement.  These five                      dimensions of justice court processing, classified by crime type,               age, race, and sex, will be analyzed in conjunction with social,                economic, demographic, and court organizational data for over 300               counties in 1985 and 1990.  Both stability and change in the                    macrostructural context of juvenile courts will be examined as they             bear on theories of the underclass and social dislocations,                     political economy, conflict, and social control.  Through rigorous              analysis of how contextual factors shape juvenile court processing              across jurisdictions and over time, this study is likely to produce             important new knowledge that will establish the research agenda for             years to come.",
