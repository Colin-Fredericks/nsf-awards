 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of an integrated research program into the                 oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea.  It is to be                carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR                  scientists from February to June 1992.  The work proposed here is               an effort to measure vertical profiles of velocity and                          temperature using an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP)                   and a string of twelve internally recording temperature sensors,                as well as a Rapid Sampling Vertical Profiler, a tethered sensor                system that free falls through the upper 250 meters of the ocean.               The upper ocean is a relatively active zone where turbulent                     motion is produced both by shear flow and by the movement of sea                ice through the water.  The objective is to study how turbulent                 energy is created and destroyed by the exchange of momentum and                 energy across density surfaces in the upper mixed layer, by shear               induced mixing, and by the differential diffusion of heat and                   salt.  The frequent and quasi-continuous current profiles                       produced by the ADCP will be used to define the internal gravity                wave field, and how gravity waves are affected by the bottom                    topography.  When supplemented by information on the regional                   temperature structure of the upper ocean, the observations will                 allow a separation of the barotropic and baroclinic component of                the surface currents.",
