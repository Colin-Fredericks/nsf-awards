 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of topology became an independent mathematical                   discipline around the turn of the century.  Since then, it has                  grown into a large and diversified area of mathematical activity.               Methods from the different subareas of topology have widely                     influenced current research in many other areas, from mathematical              physics to algebra and number theory.  The conference supported by              this grant will focus on the use of topology in three main areas of             current research:  Global geometry, topology and mathematical                   physics (including gauge field theory, topological and conformal                quantum field theories, and the global geometry of the Dirac                    operator); Algebraic geometry and algebraic K-theory; and Dynamical             systems.                                                                             The conference, entitled Topological Methods in Modern                     Mathematics, will be held at SUNY Stony Brook, June 14-21, 1991.                In each of the three areas there will be broad survey talks                     together with more detailed lectures on the most important and                  exciting recent developments.  The conference will provide an                   opportunity for mathematicians from three distinct mathematical                 disciplines whose common feature is the use of topological methods              and results to come together and interact in an extremely fruitful              way.  In addition, special tutorial programs are planned for                    graduate and undergraduate students, so that they may also                      participate in the conference and gain a sense of the reality and               excitement of research mathematicians.",
