 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vasopressin and oxytocin are closely related neuroendocrine                     peptide hormones synthesized in specialized neurons of the                      hypothalamus that project to the posterior pituitary, where they                have access to the general circulation.  Vasopressin is                         predominately involved in the physiological mechanisms of water                 balance and hemodynamic homeostasis, whereas oxytocin regulates                 milk ejection during lactation and uterine smooth muscle                        contractions during parturition.  Although these two neuropeptide               hormones exhibit widely differing physiological properties, they                are structurally very similar.  Since oxytocin and vasopressin                  only differ in two of the nine amino acids, it is believed that                 they are derived from a common ancestral gene.  However, despite                the great physiological importance of these hormones, almost                    nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying their                transcriptional regulation.  Dr. Sherman will describe the                      genetic region that contains both the vasopressin and oxytocin                  genes.  He will concentrate on the structure and sequence of the                5, flanking regions for the vasopressin and oxytocin duplication                domain which are oriented in an inverted fashion and separated by               approximately 9 kb of intergenic DNA.  This region may represent                the vestiges of a gene duplication event.  In addition, Dr.                     Sherman will use state-of-the-art molecular biological                          methodologies to elucidate possible functional and tissue-                      specific relationships between the vasopressin and oxytocin genes               during physiological expression.  Understanding the molecular                   events involved in the transcriptional regulation of vasopressin                and oxytocin mRNA expression in the hypothalamus will lead to a                 better understanding of the neuronal events leading to the                      secretion of these hormones by neuroendocrine cells.  These                     studies interface neuroendocrine cell biology with neuronal and                 endocrine mechanisms.",
