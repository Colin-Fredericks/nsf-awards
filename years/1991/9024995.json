 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues earlier studies of applications of                  topology to problems in biology and chemistry. There are three                  main areas of effort. The first is the application of                           classification and quantification techniques in knot theory to                  the analysis of enzyme-DNA three-dimensional structure and enzyme               mechanism. Mathematical models, such as the tangle model, will be               developed and perfected, the aim being to produce a mathematical                tool of use to the experimental molecular biologist. The                        mathematics used here is recent work in the theory of                           3-manifolds, and the biological input is experimental results                   obtained from the topological approach to enzymology. The second                area is the study of the topological entanglement of random                     chains in 3-space.  Random chain entanglement statistics are                    related to the conformational entropy of a polymer system in                    dilute solution.  Asymptotic entanglement (as the length goes to                infinity) is reasonably well understood; the fundamental problem                of scientific interest is the description and computation of                    entanglement at finite lengths.  Both rigorous mathematics and                  simulation techniques will be employed.   The third area is the                 topological description of spiral wave patterns in excitable                    media.     The methods of differential topology and obstruction                 theory will be used to provide necessary and sufficient                         conditions for the existence and time evolution of patterns on                  bounded orientable 3-manifolds.                                                      A central problem in molecular biology is to deal with                     long-chain DNA molecules. The way they fold, replicate, and                     recombine is intimately bound up with their functions. The                      behavior of long-chain polymers in solution is a more general                   form of the same questions. Important applications arise in                     genetic engineering, the design of drugs, and the development of                long-chain polymers for industrial and technological uses.  Knot                theory is a part of topology that studies exactly these kinds of                questions: how structures fold and recombine and replicate.",
