 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will conduct research on some                   analytical and computational problems related to the Riccati                    transformation, the superstability phenomenon for integration of                stiff differential equations, and invariant manifold                            approximation.  This work involves (i) further study,                           implementation and software production of reliable algorithms for               integrating differential Riccati equations, (ii) using the                      differential Riccati equation to perform mesh-selection for stiff               systems of two-point boundary value problems, (iii)                             software production of a code for nonlinear two-point boundary                  value problems based on the Riccati method.  He will further                    study the so-called superstability phenomenon arising during                    adaptive integration of stiff differential equations, seeking                   efficient techniques that avoid the practical superstability                    occurrences and that can be incorporated into general purpose                   ordinary differential equation solvers.  Finally, he will                       continue working on numerical approximation of invariant                        manifolds, in fact on the numerical solution of the associated                  systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations.  This                     involves (i) approximation analysis for the nonlinear case, (ii)                efficient solution techniques (multigrid approaches) for the                    resulting linear systems, (iii) exploitation of the link with the               Riccati transformation.                                                              Most realistic physical phenomena are modelled by                          complicated nonlinear systems of differential equations.                        Exact solution of these systems is hopeless, and numerical                      simulation is a necessity.  This work aims at producing reliable,               and rigorously justified, algorithms to solve some of these                     systems.  The intent is to produce software tools for the                       working scientist.  In particular, work on the Riccati equation                 will be of value to people working in Games' Theory, Optimal                    Control and connected Engineering fields.  The work on so-called                stiff differential equations is useful in solving  systems                      having different time-scales, such as in chemical kinetics and                  aerodynamics applications.  Finally, the work on approximation of               invariant manifolds is useful in understanding the long-term                    behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems.  This has applications                 in many areas of applied science.",
