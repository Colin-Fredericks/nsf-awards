 "awd_abstract_narration": "Micellar Electrokinetic Capillary Chromatography (MECC) is one                                                                                                  of the operational modes of High Performance Capillary                          Electrophoresis (HPCE) specifically designed for the                            separation of neutral compounds or mixtures of neutral and                      charged compounds.  Neutral compounds are separated based on                    their differential partitioning between the aqueous phase and                   the hydrophobic interior of the micellar phase.  MECC combines                                                                                                  the strengths of capillary electrophoresis with its high                        separation efficiency and liquid chromatography with its                        resolving power of neutral compounds.  MECC is an important                     new separation method for biological, biochemical, and                          pharmaceutical applications.  A fundamental problem in MECC is                                                                                                  its limited retention window.  This obstacle limits the                         separation resolution and the number of components capable of                   being separated by MECC.  An easy way for increasing the range                                                                                                  of the retention window involves the direct control of                          electroosmosis.  The use of an additional electric field                        applied from outside of the capillary  for directly and                         dynamically controlling electroosmosis is proposed.  The                        fundamentals of this approach are studied experimentally and                    theoretically with a proposed capacitor model.  The separation                                                                                                  resolution of amino acids as model systems are tested and                       compared to that of previous methods.",
