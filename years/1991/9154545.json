The conference and                        follow-up activities are designed to support the district's                     efforts to improve the quality of elementary science and                        mathematics education programs in the county by coordinating                    and conducting training and technical assistance activities                     for district elementary education personnel.  The conference                    grows out of a recently initiated partnership agreement                         between the County and NSF in which NSF pledged its support of                  county efforts to strengthen precollege educational                             activities.  The focus of the conference is the application of                  national and state science and mathematics performance                          standards in the elementary classroom.",
