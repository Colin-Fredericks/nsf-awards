 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          David Hammer, Cornell University, and Dr. Malcolm Haines,                       Plasma Physics Group, Imperial College, London, England.                        The objective of the proposed project is to carry out a                         series of experiments designed to determine conditions in                       detail as a function of time in dense z-pinch and x-pinch                       plasmas.                                                                                                                                                        Such plasmas are produced by first using the initial                            portion of the current from submicrosecond \"pulsed power\"                       generators to explode fine wires (0.0025-0.025 cm. diameter),                   and then magnetically \"pinching\" the resulting plasma to                        very small diameters with the field produced by the peak                        current.  These experiments will be performed at Imperial                       College because of the availability there of a unique set                       of advanced electro-optical diagnostic instruments for use                      with any of several pulsed power devices.  It will be                           possible to obtain time and space-resolved measurements of                      z-pinch and x-pinch plasma densities, ionization states,                        implosion speeds, and locations and durations of x-ray                          bright spots, using x-ray and visible light-sensitive                           intensified image converter \"streak\" and \"framing\" cameras                      with nanosecond resolution, nanosecond pulsed lasers, and a                     variety of visible and x-ray spectroscopic instruments. The                     ultimate goal of this project is to achieve an improved                         understanding of the dynamics of dense z- and x-pinch                           plasmas, so that applications to x-ray lithography, pumping                     short wavelength lasers and controlled fusion might be                          confidently evaluated.  This project will benefit from the                      complementary expertise of the two investigators in gas                         pinches and laser plasma research.",
