 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the proposed research program we plan to develop                             a series of new tunable solid-state laser materials                             based on tetravalent chromium (Cr4+) as laser-active                            ion in various low field dielectric crystal hosts and                           study their spectroscopic and laser properties.  These                          novel tunable solid state lasers are expected to                                operate in the technologically important near infrared                          spectral region between 1 - 2 um. Conventional                                  chromium-doped lasers are based on Cr3+ as an active                            ion.                                                                                                                                                            The spectroscopic and lasing properties of the various                          new tetravalent chromium-doped laser crystals will be                           investigated in order to obtain better understanding                            of lasing mechanisms in these tunable solid-state                               lasers.  One host crystal candidate with suitable                               tetrahedral sites where Cr4+ ion may substitute for a                           tetravalent cation will be selected and grown for                               spectroscopic and laser studies each year.  Most                                promising crystal hosts are various oxide crystals                              containing the SiO4 or GeO4 tetrahedra in its crystal                           lattice.  Measurements of the absorption spectra,                               excitation spectra, fluorescence spectra, and                                   fluorescence lifetime as a function of temperature                              and wavelength will be performed to identify optically                          active centers.  Gain and excited state absorption will                         be measured to determine possible loss mechanisms                               in tetravalent chromium-doped crystals.  Different                              modes of laser operation will be investigated.  The                             expected lasing (1-2 um) and forming (500-1000nm)                               wavelengths by second harmonic generation are                                   important for many possible applications in optical                             communication, coherent laser radar, night vision                               technology, remote sensing, range finding, counter                              measure, infrared semiconductor diagnosis, and                                  medical applications.",
