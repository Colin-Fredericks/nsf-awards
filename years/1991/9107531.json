Attention will be focussed on problems amenable to                  treatment using the tools of martingale calculus, local time and                excursion theory.  Particular subjects for study are the                        following:  interval partitions associated with a subordinator,                 multiple points of Brownian motion in dimensions 2 and 3,                       Tsirelson's equations in discrete time, non-canonical                           decompositions of Brownian motion, the Ciesielski-Taylor                        identities in law, multivariate Cauchy variables and affine                     decompositions of a stable variable of index (1/2), intertwinings               of Markov processes, and characterization of the Brownian                       filtration.

Attention will be focussed on problems amenable to                  treatment using the tools of martingale calculus, local time and                excursion theory.
