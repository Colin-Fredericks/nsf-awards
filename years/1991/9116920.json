 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Epel is seeking support under the Small Grants for                          Exploratory Research for assistance in moving his lab into a new                research direction - the cellular mechanisms by which embryos of                aquatic organisms resist deleterious effects of xenobiotics, both               natural and anthropogenic. He will focus on embryos since this is               a particularly sensitive phase of the organism's life history.                  This new work combines his long term work and interest in cell                  and developmental biology with a new interest and concern about                 the effects of man-introduced chemicals into the marine                         environment. Besides providing new insights about embryonic                     defense mechanisms, this work will also yield new and unexpected                insights on the normal functioning of cells in both the embryonic               and adult phases of the organisms's life history. It will test                  the possibility that the multi-drug resistance or P-glycoproteins               transport system, whose role has been primarily assumed to be of                medical importance in terms of transporting hydrophobic drugs out               of cells, is normally (i.e., in the historical or evolutionary                  sense) utilized for removal or detoxification of                                xenobiotics/pollutants. This idea, if correct, would provide a                  novel insight into how organisms, and in particular aquatic                     organisms, can resist the effects of man-made and natural noxious               compounds. This work could also provide a \"natural history\" or                  evolutionary basis for why these proteins are present and their                 role in the normal life history of the organism.",
