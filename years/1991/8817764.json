 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project involving a two-ship and single ship multichannel             seismic survey of the Society and Marquesas hot spot chains in the              Pacific ocean.  It is a collaborative project with the French.                  Work will include wide angle and expanding spread two-ship profiles             and single ship MCS.  The study is aimed at understanding the                   nature of zero age volcanism at the southeast end of the chains,                the factors contributing to the onset of volcanism at the northwest             end of the chains, and the relationship of the hot spots to the                 Marquesas Fracture Zone.  A particular objective is to understand               hot spotlithospheric interaction in two different setting--normal               lithosphere and weak lithosphere.                                                                                                                               Mid-plate volcanism and its interaction with oceanic lithosphere is             a process of fundamental importance in understanding the structure              and evolution of ocean basins.  Active source seismic studies such              as this one will provide important detailed information regarding               the structure of the lithosphere beneath and surrounding volcanic               loads that is currently lacking.  Dr. McNutt and her co-workers are             among the leaders in the study of mid-plate volcanism and                       lithospheric structure, as well as multichannel seismics.",
