 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is establishing a Scanning Tunneling Microscope                    (STM) in an undergraduate Modern Physics Laboratory. It is                      enabling undergraduates, for the first time, to actually see                    atomic surfaces and \"see atoms\". The aim is to actively expose                  advanced physics majors to contemporary, state- of-the-art                      surface physics. The mechanical part of the microscope is being                 built in the departmental machine shop, using a proven design,                  and interfaced to a PC computer. The design of this STM permits                 its use by senior undergraduate students and yet allows                         modifications and improvements by such students. The students                   are able to use the latest methods of preparing scanning tips                   and study naturally clean, quality surfaces of carbon, gold,                    TaS2 and TaSe2. These surfaces show both atomic and electronic                  structure without the difficulties of high vacuum techniques.                   The students are exposed to modern methods of image processing                  using a high speed, high video resolution, personal computer as                 a necessary part of the STM. This Nobel prize winning method of                 probing the atomic structure of surfaces permits physics                        students to do what has not been possible before; to actually                   \"see\" an atom.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from                 non-federal sources.",
