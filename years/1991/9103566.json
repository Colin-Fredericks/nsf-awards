 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator and his students                will work on a number of problems in complex variable theory                    centered around the distribution of values of complex functions.                In particular, they will study the ramification and value-                      distribution properties of quasi-regular mappings, the                          exceptional set in the Gross star theorem and in Plessner's                     theorem, and the error term in the Nevanlinna theory.  In                       addition,  the principal investigator and his students will                     explore the application of some of this work to problems in                     differential equations and complex iteration.                                        The area of complex variable theory has had a long and                     distinguished history, and the principal investigator is one of                 the leaders in the subarea of complex variable theory concerned                 with the distribution of the values of complex functions.  In                   this project the principal investigator will work with graduate                 students to extend our knowledge of the value-distribution                      properties of various classes of functions that arise as                        solutions of differential equations in the complex plane.",
