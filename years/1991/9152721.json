 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to improve the learning,                       retention, and application of physics concepts and principles                   by students enrolled in physics classes at Joliet Junior                        College (JJC).  This is being accomplished by introducing a                     series of new experiences using contemporary computer and video                 technology in physics.  A microcomputer is used in the areas of                 force, motion, temperature, and radiation to perform data                       collection, analysis, and graphing; and is used to construct,                   execute, and display physical simulations in mechanics.  Stop-                  action videotapes are used to collect data in projectile and                    rotational motion.  Microcomputers and video technology provide                 immediate feedback that makes possible a larger number and                      variety of trials and motivates students to probe in greater                    detail.The grant is providing software and hardware for six,                    networked, color Macintosh II workstations equipped with a                      Universal Lab Interface with appropriate sensors and probes.                    The grant also is providing a shared LaserWriter II, modem, CD                  player, scanner, high resolution video camera, and playback                     deck.  This support revitalizes the physics courses at JJC and                  provides current technology much more quickly than would                        otherwise be possible.This project is encouraging students to                   continue study or to support science by improving their                         experiences in physics, increasing science literacy, helping to                 prepare JJC's physics courses for the next century, and                         stimulating other community colleges to adapt this approach.NSF                 grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal                       sources.",
