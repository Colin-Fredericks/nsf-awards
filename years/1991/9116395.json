 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular data offer the possibility of helping to resolve                      relationships among distantly related organism.  Nucleotide                     sequence data have the potential to be especially informative.                  But one difficulty is that there are only four character states                 (representing the four different nucleotides) at any one position               in the sequence.  If the molecule is changing rapidly or the time               since divergence is long, multiple substitutions at any particular              position may obscure information about relationships of the                     organisms.  If we knew which positions were most likely to have                 sustained multiple substitutions we might give that information                 less weight in an analysis of relationships.  This project will                 test one method of determining which positions are more likely to               have sustained multiple substitutions.  We will obtain sequence                 data of a particular chloroplast gene for genera within one family              of flowering plants and determine which nucleotide positions vary               within that family.  We will then obtain sequence data of that same             gene from a number of divergent angiosperm families for which we                have a reasonable idea of the true relationships.  We will use the              information on variation in nucleotide sequence within one family               to help decide which nucleotide positions provide accurate                      information on the relationships of the divergent angiosperms.  The             similarity of results of analyses of relationships using                        information on the likelihood of multiple substitution with the                 true relationships will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the                 method.",
