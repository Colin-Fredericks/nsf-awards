 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Washington for the conversion of the Chemistry                    Library Building into the Environmental Chemistry Facility which                will house interdisciplinary research and research training in                  atmospheric and environmental chemistry, encompassing a                         coordinated program of research in critical aspects of                          biogeochemistry and global climate change.  This building was                   constructed in 1957 and last renovated in 1988.  The ARFMP grant                of $225,000 and $335,155 provided by the grantee as cost sharing                will be used to modernize these research and research training                  facilities providing a centrally located focus for campus-wide                  disciplinary strengths in the earth and natural sciences.  This                 project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure by means of a major upgrading and expansion of the               existing ventilation system, including the addition of air                      conditioning, and redistributing or modifying the power and                     electrical systems on a room by room basis.                                                                                                                     This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of a new                      coordinated program of research of national importance in critical              aspects of biogeochemistry and global climate change under the                  aegis of faculty from Chemistry, Atmospheric Sciences, and                      Oceanography and for the training of quality undergraduate and                  graduate students.",
