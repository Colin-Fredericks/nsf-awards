 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop is addressed to undergraduate college faculty who                 teach courses in  historical geology, paleontology, petrology, or               related fields, and who have had little or no experience in modern              carbonates.  The purpose of the workshop is to expand the                       participant's understanding of modern carbonate sediments,                      precursors of ancient carbonates, and post depositional changes                 that affect them.  Specific topics to be examined include                       carbonate-secreting organisms, sediments, environments of                       deposition, carbonate diagenesis, soil formation and interpretation             of Pleistocene analogues.  This workshop will also provide the                  participant with an opportunity to acquire photographs of specific              carbonate environments and to collect samples which may be used to              enhance instruction at his/her home institution.  A guidebook,                  approximately 100 pages in length, will be prepared and provided                for each participant.  Sets of slides of features requiring special             equipment will be provided to each participant including such                   material as underwater photographs and photomicrographs.  The                   program involves daily field work, labs and lectures and will be                held at the Bahamian Field Station, San Salvador, Bahamas.  As much             of the field work will involve snorkeling, participants must be                 able to swim.//",
