 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hampshire College, although a relatively new institution, has                   a reputation for excellence in the teaching of science.                         Introductory courses for both science majors and nonmajors                      focus on inquiry methods and often involve students in                          independent projects in the laboratory. These relatively                        sophisticated student projects for beginners have become the                    hallmark of Hampshire's innovative science education. Modern                    research laboratories often incorporate networked computers and                 analytical instruments which allow distributed data                             acquisition, analysis and control. To allow our students to                     develop skills needed for working in up-to-date research labs,                  the department proposes to update and expand our equipment for                  computerized data acquisition. The unit will provide enough                     work stations to make teaching of introductory courses feasible                 and expand our use of graphics and statistical analysis                         software to encourage students to acquire better quantitative                   skills. Specific courses affected will be \"How People Move\" and                 \"Cardiovascular Fitness and Disease.\" Our goal is to increase                   the quantitative and analytical skills of our students through                  direct contact with modern computer-based experimental methods,                 design and analysis.",
