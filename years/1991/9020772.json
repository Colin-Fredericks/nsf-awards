 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Scholars Award for Methodological Training to a                       linguistic anthropologist at the University of Georgia to develop               methodological skills in the linguistic analysis of speech                      signals using a computer-based system.  The funds will allow the                purchase of a machine designed to facilitate graphing and                       analysis of speech signals, and to allow the PI to study with a                 local expert in the use of the machine.  The project will analyze               patterns of speech between parents/caregivers and children to                   identify aspects of the acoustic features of the interaction that               can predict patterns oflanguage acquisition by children.  The                   data will be taped speech from the PI's previous research in                    English, Spanish and Luo (a Kenyan language), as well as new data               collected during this project of English speaking parents and                   children.                                                                                                                                                       This Scholars Award for Methodological Training is important                    because advances in understanding the importance of \"prosody\",                  the acoustic elements in speech, are necessary to advance our                   understanding of how people learn to speak in general.  With the                advent of more sophisticated, computer based analysis systems,                  our scientific personnel need support to become expert in the new               methodology.",
