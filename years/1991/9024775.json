 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor David M. Hercules of the University               of Pittsburgh and two of his graduate students to collaborate in                analytical chemistry research with Professor Alfred Benninghoven                and his group of the University of Muenster, Germany.  Together they            will study fragmentation of polymers subjected to ion and neutral               bombardment, and gas phase decomposition of polymers.  They will                also develop methods for determining molecular weight distributions             of polymers sampled directly from solids.                                                                                                                       This research, supported jointly by the U.S.-Germany Cooperative                Science Program of the Division of International Programs and the               Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division,             will continue the collaboration between the PI, a surface scientist             known for his development of electron spectroscopy for chemical                 analysis and for his work on secondary ionization mass spectrometry             (SIMS), and a world class German chemist who originated a particular            design of time-of-flight SIMS instrument, which provides high                   sensitivity and moderate resolution for spectra from complex                    samples.  Dr. Hercules has obtained the second of these instruments,            so collaboration will allow the US partners to quickly reach the                state of the art in this complex technology.  The German col-                   laborators will obtain added expertise in SIMS sampling of                      polymers.                                                                                                                                                       Polymers are long chain molecules, whose use has resulted in                    humanity's ability to design structural materials and lubricants                to suit a variety of needs, without being restricted by nature's                more limited repertoire.  Polymers are generally \"polydisperse\"                 i.e. the result of making a polymer is a group of related molecules             of similar structure but different length.  Understanding such                  length differences requires sampling the solid polymer without                  changing the chain-length distribution or dispersity, a difficult               task.  Polymer scientists in general require better methods for                 studying polymer structure in solids.  Linking the sampling methods             (developed by Dr. Hercules) together with the structural measurement            techniques (developed by Dr. Benninghoven) will be a significant                contribution to fundamental and applied research in analytical                  chemistry.",
