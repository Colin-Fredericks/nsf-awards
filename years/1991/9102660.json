 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues previous work on nonlinear and stochastic                networks.  The basic research involves the design of efficient                  algorithms for large-scale network optimization problems.  Attention            will be paid to the inclusion of uncertainty within the model -                 stochastic networks - and to nonlinearities in the objective function.          Many problems in engineering and management can be represented as a             network in which some (or all) of the parameters are stochastic.                Examples include:  air-traffic control, hydroelectric power                     scheduling, financial investment strategies, transportation planning,           productions/distribution, and personnel planning systems.  Adding               uncertainty to an optimization model greatly complicates the search             for efficient algorithms.  This research will focus on a new                    decomposition method, called diagonal quadratic approximation (DQA),            that combines a penalty and an interior-point barrier approach.                 Initial results indicate that the DQA method is competitive with the            leading stochastic programming algorithm - progressive hedging.  Both           methods are amenable to parallel implementation.  The DQA method can            be designed for a massively parallel computer.  Thus, DQA applies to            the multi-stage stochastic program, whereby large numbers of scenarios          are required.  The research will consider alternative versions of DQA           and will study the theoretical aspects of convergence.  Extensive               computational tests will be made on a variety of serial and parallel            computers, including a massively parallel SIMD machine.  The research           promises to make substantial progress in the handling of stochastic             programming problems with a very large number of scenarios.  The                significance of the project is indicated by the wide range of                   applications that can be solved as network optimization problems                under uncertainty.",
