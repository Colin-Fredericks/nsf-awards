 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pagurus is a genus of shell-dwelling crustaceans, commonly                 known as \"hermit crabs\".  They are diverse and abundant around                  the world, and they have been the subject of countless studies by               ecologists and population biologists.  The fact that hermit crabs               inhabit snail shells has probably directed the evolution of their               carapaces and appendages along certain narrow pathways, and this                phenomenon of convergence has produced a tangled taxonomy and                   classification for the group.  Dr. Patsy McLaughlin proposes an                 ambitious study of the 147 described species of hermit crabs, in                which she will describe larval, juvenile, and adult                             characteristics.  Rearing protocols will provide a wealth of new                data on the developmental pathways of individual species.  The                  resulting data will form the foundation for future analyses of                  evolutionary relationships within this group.                                        The proposed research will have a wide audience beyond the                 community of hermit crab systematists.  Marine ecologists and                   zoogeographers, functional morphologists, developmental                         biologists, and a variety of other disciplines will use the                     resulting evolutionary relationships as a framework for future                  comparative studies.  Evolutionary biologists will appreciate                   this study's focus on how mechanical constraints of growth and                  function can channel the path of evolution.",
