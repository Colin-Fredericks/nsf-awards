 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an interdisciplinary, site-specific modeling study                 focused on the Georges Bank conducted within the GLOBEC -                       Global Ocean Ecocsystems Dyanamics framework of the U.S. Global                 Change Research Program.  It involves a collaborative effort on                 the part of U.S. and Canadian scientists at the Department of                   Fisheries and Oceans.  Biological and physical data will be                     examined with the aid of three-dimensional circulation models                   under development at Dartmouth College and Skidaway Institute of                Oceanography.                                                                        The study will focus on sea scallops (Placopectin                          magellanicus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and the copepod                      Calanus finmarchicus.  Larval drift models driven by the                        circulation models will be created and used to determine the                    extent to which egg and larval distributions on Georges Bank can                be explained by the monthly-mean circulation fields; and to                     evaluate the significance of simple behaviors (vertical                         migration) and more complex physics (time-dependence, spatial                   structures) to the egg and larval distributions.                                     The general approach will be to focus on the null hypothesis               that distributions are determined by passive advection and                      diffusion in the monthly-mean circulation fields, and the                       corollary that apparent \"retention\" is merely a reflection of the               Bank's natural residence time.  Hypotheses for significant                      influences from higher-frequency flow variability, small-scale                  flow structures and vertical migration will also be explored.",
