 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze the productivity within               manufacturing industries using the longitudinal research data                   base at the Bureau of the Census.  The goal of this research is                 to determine why some industrial plants are more productive than                others and, to ask whether there is any systematic relation                     between trends in the productivity growth of an industry and                    changes in the distribution of productivity of the plants within                that industry.  This project is important because it will help us               better understand the factors governing productivity at the                     plant and industry level.                                                                                                                                       The first part of the analysis will use the rankings of                         productivity of plant and nonparametric tests to determine                      whether, when productivity growth slowed, was the slowdown                      uniform across plants or did some plants slow more or less than                 others?  Did the plants that were on the productivity frontier                  slow more or less?  Similar questions can be asked for the                      period of the rebound in productivity.  The second part of the                  analysis will follow the productivity of plants over time in                    order to assess alternative models of the productivity                          distribution.",
