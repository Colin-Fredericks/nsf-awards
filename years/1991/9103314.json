 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will develop statistical methods for testing                 for patterns in multilinear models, methods applicable even                     when the parameters of the patterned model cannot be                            identified.  Statistical methodology for incorporating                          nonparametric smoothing and covariates when several vectors are                 measured on each subject will also be developed.  Detailed real                 examples will be analyzed to illustrate the methods and                         demonstrate their applicability.                                                  The fitting of a low-rank model to a three-way data array                     containing noise is an active area of research with important                   applications in chemometrics and psychometrics.  The project                    furthers VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for                    women to advance their careers in science or engineering                        through research, and to encourage other women to pursue                        careers in these areas through the investigators' enhanced                      visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In this                        project, the proposed activities which contribute to the second                 objective include:  actively participating in and giving                        lectures for the Biostatistics Workshop (a joint enterprise                     between the Department of Statistics and the School of Medicine                 which meets twice weekly during the Fall Quarter); giving                       lectures on her research to the Statistics Department's faculty                 and graduate students as part of a biweekly lecture series;                     participating in the Department's program of collaborative                      research with active research scientists from around the                        University; and meeting with undergraduate majors to discuss                    career opportunities in Statistics.",
