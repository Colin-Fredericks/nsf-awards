 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding agencies, both private and governmental, have recognized                the need to subsidize basic research.  The product of this research             is then in the public domain and its use is unrestricted.  The                  major problem with this approach is that the replacement of market              forces with committee decision making means that the normal                     guidance that market forces provide, however imperfect in this                  context, are unavailable.  Substitute criteria must be established              by which grants can be made.  This project examines rigorously,                 using economic theory and empirical analysis, the incentive effects             of various award schemes and their economic efficiency.                                                                                                         The subsidization of research by government agencies poses problems             not unlike those encountered by firms trying to motivate workers.               This project starts with theories of the incentive aspects of                   industrial relations which relate to whether workers should be paid             on input or output, which discuss how often workers should be                   evaluated, and which are concerned with last period problems and                motivating older workers.  These are applied to analyze the                     incentive aspects of research funding criteria.  The following are              representative of the types of important questions addressed by                 this project:                                                                   1.  How much weight should be placed on past performance versus the             quality of the current proposal?                                                2.  How long a period should be funded without review?                          3.  At what stage in the project should the funding review occur?               4.  Should the criteria be experience adjusted so that researchers              compete only with cohorts?                                                      5.  How should cost affect the probability of receiving an award?               6.  Should many small awards be granted or is it better to give a               few large ones?                                                                 7.  Who should judge the proposals, peers or professional                       administrators?                                                                                                                                                 The analysis has implications for other areas as well.  For                     example, managers must assign projects to workers.  Should they use             past performance as the main guide or the ex ante quality of a                  worker's idea for performing the task?  In politics, incumbency is              a major advantage.  Is this efficient and, if so, under what                    circumstances?  What are the incentive effects of blind journal                 refereeing?",
