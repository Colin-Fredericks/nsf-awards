Seedlings               of six Cecropia species will be grown from seed under high and                  low light regimes in temperate greenhouse and transplant gardens                in southeastern Peru'.  Ant attracting traits, leaf tannin                      concentrations, and toughness will be monitored in relation to                  plant performance, especially growth rates and leaf lifetimes                   (thought to determine the pattern of investment in chemical and                 ant-defense).  Performance data on transplanted seedlings with                  and without herbivores will test specific hypotheses for habitat                specificity in these trees.                                                     Short-term experiments with cultivated seedlings will test for 1)               habitat and host specificity in four specialized symbiotic ants;                2) rates of host resource supply to ants as a determinant of the                species composition of symbiotic relationships: 3) habitat and                  species specificity in effects of different ants on herbivory                   rates, host performances, and colony growth and reproduction.                   Natural seedling populations are used to investigate species                    specificity in host choice by queens and host mechanisms for                    excluding certain ants.  Results of studies will be synthesized                 to test hypotheses that: plant resource environments determine                  predictable patterns of investment in alternative defense                       systems and patterns of defense investment determine the species                composition of ant-plant associations.  Findings will contribute                to basic ecological science and will also add to the knowledge                  base on the biodiversity of tropical forests. //",
