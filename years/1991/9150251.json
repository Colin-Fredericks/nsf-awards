 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will educate elementary teachers so that they                      will be able to improve their teaching of science and                           institute a comprehensive authentic assessment and                              reporting system into school districts of varying sizes and                     characteristics.  In these districts, as in others across                       the country, there is a strong need for alignment among                         what is taught (curriculum), how it is taught                                   (instruction), how it is measured (assessment), and how it                      is shared (reporting).  Too often student performance                           within hands-on science programs is not documented at all                       or is subject to being measured by standardized tests that                      often offer little correlation to what is expected from                         these programs.  During this project personnel from four                        Minnesota school districts (Minneapolis, Osseo, Duluth,                         Wayzata) will work in partnership over a three year period                      of time with the Minnesota Department of Education to (1)                       become knowledgeable about recent research and developments                     in assessment alternatives, (2) adapt and further develop                       their elementary science programs, and (3) inservice others                     in their districts to use these authentic assessment                            systems as standard operating procedures.  When                                 successfully instituted, this program will have directly                        affected more than 1,500 teachers and 45,000 students.                                                                                                          The cost sharing will be 16 percent of the NSF portion.",
