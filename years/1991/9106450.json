 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns parallel evaluation of deductive database                 queries by processors interconnected by a communication network.                Deductive database systems are key to the future design of                      complex applications like knowledge bases, expert systems, and                  scientific applications. Yet the potential of such systems is                   compromised by poor performance in environments where the data                  cannot fit in main memory. Parallelization is investigated as the               means to improve performance, with attention on Datalog, a logic-               based deductive language that naturally expresses queries that                  arise in advanced database applications. Based on three                         parameters of discriminating functions, discriminating variables                and hash functions, a framework for the parallelization of                      Datalog programs is designed. Discriminating functions and                      variables which establish only required interconnections between                parallel processors, thereby minimizing the overhead of                         unnecessary communication, are investigated. Hash functions are                 designed which capture the division of labor between processors                 and provide maximum performance by effectively balancing the                    workload. Although parallel systems promise enormous computing                  resources, their performance rests on the design of sophisticated               parallelizing compilers that can make effective use of such                     resources. This research makes a pragmatic contribution to                      parallel system performance by providing an approach to the                     automatic parallel evaluation of an important subset of deductive               database programs, Datalog.",
