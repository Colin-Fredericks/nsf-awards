Shore of the Department of                         Chemistry, Ohio State University, for synthesis of new                          transition metal carbonyl cluster compounds.  The number of                     metals in the cluster used as the starting material is                          typically six, and metals are Ru or Os.  Loss of CO from known                  clusters results in new species which can be utilized in the                    synthesis of mixed metal clusters containing seven metal atoms.                 Attempts will be made to encapsulate boron into the mixed-metal                 clusters thus formed.  Additional target molecules result from                  reaction of lanthanide cations with ruthenium, iron, and                        iron-ruthenium carbonylates.  In a second part of the project,                  the behavior of clusters on magnesia surfaces will be                           investigated, especially with respect to proton transfer,                       thermal degradation, and reaction with hydrogen.                                %%%                                                                             This project involves the development of new synthetic methods                  for metallic and bimetallic carbonyls.  Some of the species                     prepared will be used to produce metal cluster compounds                        containing electron-deficient boranes or carboranes.  Others                    will be reacted with solid magnesia to model surface reactions.                 This work has application both to understanding bonding and                     reactivity of organometallic compounds and to heterogeneous                     catalysis.",
