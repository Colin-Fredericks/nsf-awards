 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electrical engineering curriculum at UMR is experiencing a                  major restructuring that requires additional control system                     laboratory experiments.  For undergraduate EE students                          specializing in control, we need to provide a well-rounded                      education in the theory and practice of control system design in                the areas of:                                                                                                                                                   1.   Workstation-based integrated control system design                         2.   Manufacturing automation                                                   3.   Process control                                                                                                                                            In addition, we need to provide manufacturing automation courses                for non-EE students and for EE students not specializing in                     control.                                                                                                                                                        The current laboratory equipment is woefully inadequate to meet                 these goals.  The equipment requested in this proposal represents               the first step toward meeting these goals.  The equipment                       laboratory experiments supported by this equipment are scaled-                  down versions of the types of problems our graduates encounter in               industry.  The innovative features of this proposal are:                                                                                                        1.   Introduction of Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) concepts to                    undergraduate control student.                                             2.   Introduction of manufacturing automation in the                                 undergraduate curriculum.                                                  3.   Use of commercial process control equipment and a scale                         process plant teach control.",
