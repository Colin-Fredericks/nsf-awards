 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central question addressed in this research is how the                 1989 political and economic transformation of Eastern Europe has                changed the structure of social stratification in Hungary,                      Czechoslovakia, and Poland.  The study will examine how the                     emergence of private ownership, a multi-party system, and a market              economy has affected the social hierarchy in these countries.  It               does so by examining the emergence of the new elite and by studying             the pattern of status attainment in the three countries.  It is                 evident already that party membership has lost its central role as              a basis for recruitment to the elite and that ownership of economic             capital has become a distinct advantage.  It remains an open                    question, however, whether the new elite largely will be recruited              from the old cadre elite or from the old 'pre-communism' elite.                 This is one of the central questions addressed by the research.                 The second question addressed is how the opportunities for                      educational and occupational attainment for the general population              are affected by the political transformation.  The occupational                 structure remains largely unchanged but there is some evidence of               fewer constraints on opportunities for social and economic                      advancement.  Economic entrepreneurship is now possible and access              to higher education is no longer intimately tied to party                       membership and political connections.  The research will examine                whether there is indeed an opening of opportunities in the sense                that occupational attainment is less dependent on family background             and political connections than on educational attainment and                    individual aspirations and entrepreneurship.                                                                                                                         The investigators will collect survey data in all three                    countries which will allow them to investigate these important                  questions.  The abrupt social and economic changes in Eastern                   Europe provide a unique opportunity for studying how the structure              of inequality in a society is affected by its political and                     economic institutions.  The study will also become an important                 source for understanding what has happened in Eastern Europe and                the data will provide very valuable baseline data for future                    research.",
