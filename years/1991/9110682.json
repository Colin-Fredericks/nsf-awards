 "awd_abstract_narration": "When a falling liquid film flows from one horizontal tube to                    another below it, its mode (droplets, jets, or a sheet) has a                   significant impact on the hydrodynamics and heat transfer.                      There is no complete model or empirical basis for predicting                    the falling-film mode, its transitions, or effects.  The                        proposed research is directed at understanding which physical                   parameters govern the mode and its transitions, quantifying                     the coupling between mode and heat transfer, and providing a                    complete basis for predicting mode behavior.                                                                                                                    In this experimental program, a liquid film falls between two                   heated or cooled specimen tubes in a thermally controlled                       environment.  Measurements of film location, thickness, and                     velocity, along with measurements of the surrounding vapor                      temperature, pressure, velocity, and heat transfer,                             characterize the falling film and its influence.  Experiments                   are conducted with different working media, tube diameters and                  spacings, and in quiescent and forced flows, with varying heat                  fluxes, liquid mass flow rates, and thermodynamic conditions.                   Candidate parameters are examined for their influence on                        transitions and hysteresis.  Coupling between the mode and                      heat transfer are studied, to develop a basis for evaluating                    the mode and its effects.",
