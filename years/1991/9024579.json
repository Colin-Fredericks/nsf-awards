 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) was                   established in 1966 by the International Council of Scientific                  Unions (ICSU).  Working on an interdisciplinary basis, CODATA seeks             to improve the quality, reliability, processing, management, and                accessibility of data of importance to science and technology.  The             CODATA Task Group on Coordination of Protein Sequence Data Banks                was established in 1984 to provide a forum to gather information                on existing protein databases and to further stimulate                          international cooperation in the development and operation of such              databases.  In 1988 the scope of the task group was expanded to                 include other macromolecular databases and the group was                        reconstituted as the CODATA Task Group on Biological                            Macromolecules.  Its mission is to promote cooperation among                    biomolecular databases.  To this end, the Task Group meets                      annually.                                                                                                                                                       The 1991 meeting, to be held at Georgetown University, will allow               an international gathering of experts to exchange ideas on the                  meeting's general theme: a rational approach towards the                        development of infrastructures for the accumulation, integration,               and dissemination of biological information.  In additional to the              general theme, sessions will be dedicated to discussions of NMR                 databases, structural databases, sequence databases, and emergent               databases.  A session will also be devoted to planning the                      continuing activities of the task group.",
