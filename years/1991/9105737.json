 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cellulose synthesis is a significant activity of the                            differentiating cells of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium                  discoideum, but the role of cellulose during development and the                control of its synthesis have received little attention in the                  literature. The objectives of this project are: to determine the                rates, sites, and timing of cellulose synthesis; to analyze the                 cellulose found in each of four distinct extracellular structures               to see if there are biophysical differences in the cellulose that               can be related to differences in cellular structures or control;                to determine if cellulose synthesis is at any time a cell-type                  specific process; to describe the interactions between cellulose                and extracellular matrix proteins in structuring the stalk tube;                to characterize mutant strains that are unable to synthesize                    cellulose or are somehow altered in their cellulose synthesis;                  and to identify the gene for cellulose synthase and thereby study               the molecular control of cellulose synthesis. The results of this               project are significant not only for the contribution they will                 make to our knowledge of D. discoideum development, but also for                what they may tell us about the control of cellulose synthesis in               plants.",
