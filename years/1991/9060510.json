 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently developed CVD diamond thin films can be used in a wide                 variety of applications from electronics to cutting tools, infrared             optics to abrasives.  High quality diamond films are presently                  grown at rates of about 1 micron/hr.  Crucial to the successful                 commercialization of the technology is the attainment of                        larger growth rates.  Atmospheric pressure plasma torches                       have been used to obtain high diamond growth rates but are                      limited to small areas.  A high power density, 1 kW/cm2 at                      200 Torr pressure, microwave plasma discharge is proposed                       to increase growth rates by at least one order-or-                              magnitude.  A microwave discharge is chosen for scale-up of the                 deposition area, and the high quality films which are obtained.                 A study of power density, neutral pressure, substrate temperature               and plasma chemistry is proposed, for understanding the mechanisms              for diamond growth.  A commercially available high growth rate                  diamond reactor could be designed as a direct consequence of this               research.",
