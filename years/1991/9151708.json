 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project includes the introduction of several experiments                   into the Department of Chemistry's Instrumentation curriculum.                  Two experiments are proposed for advancement of the                             Instrumental Analysis course:  The Identification and                           Quantification of Pollutants in Ambient Air, and The                            Quantification of Toluene in Soil.  One experiment is proposed                  for introduction into the Advanced Inorganic laboratory                         curriculum:  Calculation of Carbonyl Force Constants in                         Manganese Pentacarbonyl Bromide.  Three other experiments are                   proposed for enhancement of the Undergraduate Research Course.                  All of these experiments and research projects feature FTIR                     analyses and technology.The Department of Chemistry's                           undergraduate research program is involved in the enhancement                   project.  Projects featuring FTIR technology include the                        following:  Coordination of Nitric Oxide to Cobaltous                           Phthalocyanines, Characterization of Non-benozoid Aromatics,                    and Polyurethane Foam as Absorbents for Organic Contaminates.                   Two of these experiments feature surface reflectance analysis                   utilizing FTIR technology.Incorporation of these experiments                    and research projects into the current curriculum will serve to                 strengthen the Department of Chemistry's undergraduate program                  by expanding and modernizing laboratory experiments and                         projects which will better prepare its students for successful                  careers in both industry and educational research.",
