 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Christopher Fuller of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Dr.                    Dolin Hansen of Adelaide University for a two year period.                      The cooperative work is to explore control of interior noise                    in aircraft using vibration inputs applied to the fuselage.                     In particular, the study compares using transputer/communi-                     cations systems and those using digital signal processing                       systems for noise control.  Areas to be examined include                        research on faster input-output control of noise, advanced                      noise sensors, and understanding of fuselage scaling effects                    on noise control.                                                                                                                                               The project represents excellent collaboration between the                      U.S. and Australian researchers.  The Australian group is                       approaching the control problem with the use of transputer/                     communications systems, which are configured to many input                      output channels at high speed.  The system at Virginia                          Polytechnic Institute is implemented on a digital signal                        processing chip, limited in terms of input and output                           channels.  The research has the potential to advance an                         increase in control channels without sacrifice of control                       speed, and lead to more rapid implementation of effective                       noise control systems in aircraft.  Application of the                          results to other areas such as underwater acoustics and                         industrial noise control are also expected.                                                                                                                     This action provides funds for Dr. Fullerr's travel in the                      first year of the project.  Funding for the second year is                      contingent upon the Australian Government's approval and                        continued provision of funds for Adelaide's part of the                         cooperative project.",
