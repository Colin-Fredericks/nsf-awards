 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steroid hormones exert dynamic control over a wide variety of                   biological functions in mammals.  An important goal is to gain an               understanding of the mechanisms by which steroids, (e.g.                        estrogens, androgens, progestins) interact with the nervous                     system to alter physiological and behavioral functions.  It is                  known that steroids can affect behavior by altering chemical                    communication between brain cells.  Indeed Dr. Dohanich reports                 that estrogen influences the chemical signals produced by                       acetylcholine, a major muscarinic cholinergic neurotransmitter.                 He has shown that estrogen activates specific behaviors in                      females, in part, through the modulation of acetylcholine                       neurotransmission.  Dr. Dohanich plans to extend his initial                    findings by determining the effects of cholinergic manipulations                on a variety of steroid hormone regulated behaviors.  In                        addition, he will investigate the role that various muscarinic                  receptors subtypes play in the regulation of these behaviors.                   Finally, Dr. Dohanich will determine the changes in cellular                    receptors for acetylcholine following hormonal manipulations that               alter these specific behaviors.  The results of this work will                  enhance our understanding of the role of neurotransmission in the               regulation of mammalian behavior.  This is important since the                  interplay between neurotransmitters and steroid hormones is a                   fundamental mechanisms that influences many functions in the                    central nervous system of mammals including humans.                             Consequently, this research has important implications for                      understanding the biological processes that underline steroid-                  dependent events ranging from reproduction to human mood states.",
