This research program will                           investigate the response of diatom growth rates to perturbations                in dissolved silicate supplies using a fluorescent dye (Rhodamine               123).  Diatoms incubated in Rhodamine 123 actively accumulate it                into the silica deposition vesicle and Rhodamine 123 is co-                     deposited with silica.  The resulting valves and girdle bands                   become fluorescent and provides a marker for cell division in                   diatoms; thus allowing for the estimation of species specific                   growth rates.  Experiments will be performed to investigate the                 potential of low dissolved silicate concentrations to limit the                 uptake of dissolved silicate and to limit diatom growth rates,                  ultimately influencing species succession with changes in ambient               dissolved silica supply rates.  The ability to distinguish                      between the limitation of uptake and the limitation of growth                   rate is critical to our understanding of nutrient limitation in                 aquatic systems.  In addition, experiments will be performed to                 investigate the response of diatom growth rate may be a key                     factor governing the phytoplankton production to new nutrient                   input.",
