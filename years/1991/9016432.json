 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will facilitate cooperation between Professor                        Dennis L. McNamara in the Sociology Department at Georgetown                    University in Washington, D.C., and Professor Keiko Imai in                     the Sociology Department at Sophia University, Tokyo.  The                      research project will focus on comparative historical methods                   of the relationship between governments and the business                        class in Japan during the postwar years.  This project is an                    effort to specify differences in comparatist styles of ties                     between State and Capital in Japan and South Korea (with                        other funding), and their effect on business class formation.                   Societal corporatism in Japanese cotton manufacture will be                     examined.  The Research will include focus on the anti-                         recession contacts among the Japan (cotton) Spinners                            Association (1965-67 and 1977-78) and the development of                        trade controls against cheaper imported textiles in the early                   1980's.  This research may lead to a better understanding of                    the institutional relationships that promote the competitive                    advantage of business in the Pacific Rim countries.                                                                                                             The project represents an excellent collaboration between the                   Japanese and U.S. scientists.  Professor McNamara has had                       considerable relevant field experience that has resulted in a                   number of publications.  He has a strong foundation in Korean                   language and area studies and will be studying intensive                        Japanese during his visit.  Professor Imai was previously                       with the Institute of Developing Economies in Japan.  She                       focuses most of her studies on Latin American development but                   also has strong comparative interests and familiarity with                      both Japan and South Korea.  Professor Imai and the Institute                   of International Relations in Tokyo will participate in                         providing the necessary contacts among leaders in academic                      business and government in both Tokyo and Osaka.  Professor                     McNamara will publish, disseminate and discuss his findings                     among scholars in the Economy and Society Research Committee                    of the International Sociological Association.  Furthermore,                    the study should provide historians, social scientists, and                     policy analysts an excellent forum for discussing models of                     business/state relations.",
