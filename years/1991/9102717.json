 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed for this project consists of two sets of                  questions in the field of dynamical systems and complex analysis.               The first set of problems concerns polynomials in a single complex              variable.  They are an extension of the analysis begun earlier,                 classifying polynomial dynamic systems in terms of their local                  behavior near the fixed points.  The second set of problems                     concerns dynamical systems on the 2-torus and the 2-disk.  Denjoy-              type theorms for homeomorphisms isotopic to the identity on the                 torus are to be formulated.  A computerized method to search for a              counterexample to the conjucture that every periodic cycle for                  every disc homeomorphism is strongly linked with a fixed point is               to be outlined on the disk.                                                                                                                                     The investigator is working in the forefront of a very active                   methematical field--dynamics.  The project furthers VPW program                 objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance their                  careers in science or engineering through research, and to                      encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas through the              investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the host                   campuses.  In this project, the proposed activities which                       contribute to the second objective include:  teaching a graduate                course entitled Computer Experiments in One-Dimensional Dynamics;               and conducting twice-monthly seminars for female graduate and                   advanced undergraduate students interested in research careers in               mathematics, including outside and inside speakers, discussion, and             counselling.",
