 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is to pilot, refine, and implement an introductory                  level college mathematics course, Algebra with Applications to                  Environmental issues (AAEI), which will replace the traditional                 college algebra.  The format and context are radically new,                     stressing experintial learning motivated by real-world problems                 in conservation, ecology and the environment.  AAEI is designed                 in the spirit of the NCTN Curriculum and Evaluation Standards                   for School Mathematics adapted to the college level,                            emphasizing mathematical modeling of real data, decision                        making, reading and writing.  Use of technology eliminates the                  boredom and drudgery of manipulation.  Group assignments,                       individual analysis, student presentations and written reports,                 will replace traditional classroom lecture and provide students                 with hands-on experinece in mathematics.  This course is                        appropriate for all entering college students, even those with                  limited mathematical experience, and offers greater access to                   further study inthe sciences, engineering ro mathematics.  AAEI                 will be fully integrated into the institution curriculum and                    will then be disseminated to each Institution in the University                 System of Georgia for consideration as a course to satisfy the                  core mathematics requirement.  A newsletter is planned to                       introduce AAEi nationally.  The response to units of this                       course already piloted indicate that students have gained a new                 perspective on mathematics as a tool, thus increasing                           awareness, enhancing interest and appreciation of its role in                   society.  Perhaps we can even eliminate the time-worn question,                 \"What's this stuff good for?.\"",
