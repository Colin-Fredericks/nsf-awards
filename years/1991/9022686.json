 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the research project is to investigate the way in which              financial and ownership structure of the manufacturing sector in                the United States affects the pursuit of long term investment                   goals, in particular, the development of new products and                       processes.                                                                                                                                                      Three different empirical studies are conducted. First, a model of              simultaneous choice of investment and financial policy is outlined,             which can be used to investigate the effect of liquidity                        constraints on research and development investment (or ordinary                 investment) at the firm level. Second, additional work will be                  undertaken that looks into the sources of gain from merger,                     leveraged buyout or other \"going private\" transactions using a                  discrete choice model of exit which also incorporates the value of              the transaction as measured by its price. Third, the same model is              used to construct predictions of takeover probability which can                 serve as a screen to identify potentially undervalued firms.                    Examination of the returns to the equities of such firms (for those             which are not subsequently acquired) provides a partial test of the             hypothesis of market myopia or undervaluation of long-term                      investment.                                                                                                                                                     An important part of the project involves updating a dataset                    constructed during a previous NSF grant which consists of balance               sheets and income statements as well as exit information for                    approximately 2700 manufacturing firms from 1959 through 1987. This             dataset has been widely used by researchers in the economics                    profession.",
