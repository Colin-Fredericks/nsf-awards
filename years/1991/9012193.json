 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Andreas Acrivos of the City                       College of New York to collaborate with Professor Uwe                           Schaflinger of the Institute of Fluid Dynamics and Heat                         Transfer, Technical University of Vienna, in a study of the                     hydrodynamic stability of a resuspended layer.  Several                         graduate students and postdoctoral associates of Dr. Acrivos                    will participate in the project.  It has recently been                          established that under laminar conditions an initially                          settled bed of solid particles is resuspended due to action                     of shear.  Further experiments have shown that the interface                    between the resuspended layer and the clear fluid becomes                       unstable due to interfacial waves.  The aim of the proposed                     cooperative research is to combine numerical calculations                       with carefully directed experiments in order to verify the                      theoretical prediction of a transition from a spatially to an                   absolutely unstable flow and to gain insight into the                           mechanisms responsible for the creation and the breakup of                      the waves.                                                                                                                                                      The research will use an experimental setup designed and                        built by Dr. Schaflinger to study the basic resuspension flow                   in a two dimensional channel.  He and his group in Vienna are                   very experienced with experimental techniques, analytical and                   numerical methods in fluid dynamics and specifically in two                     phase flows.  Complementing this is the internationally                         recognized expertise of the group at CCNY in the fields of                      shear induced migration of particles, hydrodynamic stability                    and rheology.  Their ongoing theoretical investigation of                       viscous resuspension will be greatly enhanced by this                           experimental collaboration.                                                                                                                                     Resuspension plays an important role in most sediment                           transport phenomena, including industrial problems such as                      cross flow microfiltration.  The conditions under which a                       settled layer of negatively buoyant particles will resuspend                    are not well understood and are usually associated with                         turbulence at high Reynolds numbers.  Resuspension can also                     occur at low Reynolds numbers for which inertial effects are                    insignificant and the flow is laminar.  This project will                       produce a systematic study of the instabilities at the                          interface of two superposed stratified fluids by adjusting                      the parameters of the flow in accordance with the ongoing                       analytical and numerical investigations at CCNY.  It should                     result in fundamental insights into viscous resuspension and                    the stability of multiphase flows.",
