 "awd_abstract_narration": "The planned research will pursue structural and dynamical                     properties of small molecules adsorbed within a class of porous                 solids know as zeolites.  These solids are microporous, polar,                  and have profound technological importance.  The prototypical                   small molecules for the study are those of hydrogen; the                        zeolite host is NaA.  The techniques will be modern methods for                 computer simulation of classical and quantum fluids.  As far                    as is known, this will be the first study of molecular                          diatomics in a zeolitic environment.  The structural and                        thermal properties of the confined fluid will be probed, as                     will diffusional and rotational relaxation times, the shifts                    in electronic and vibrational states that arise from proximity                  to the charges and multipoles which comprise the interstitial                   walls.                                                                            There is considerable interest in developing theoretical                      models to explore the reactivity and dynamics of small                          molecules in zeolites. This project furthers VPW program                        objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance their                  careers in science or engineering through research, and to                      encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas through                  the investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the                    host campuses.  In this project, the proposed activities which                  contribute to the second objective include:  teaching a                         chemistry course, chairing a workshop for                                       undergraduate/graduate women in greater Boston home                             institutions, advising and mentoring students in the host                       department, having an undergraduate physics student work as a                   research assistant.",
