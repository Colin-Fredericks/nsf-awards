 "awd_abstract_narration": "If a linear theory of gravitation were correct, then                       colliding plane gravitational waves in a vacuum would pass                      through one another without any alterations in their shapes or                  intensities.  However, according to the nonlinear theory of                     gravitation due to Einstein, two colliding plane gravitational                  waves in a vacuum interact and thereby produce a scattered wave                 which is not a plane wave and which differs markedly from the                   original plane waves.  The principal objective of this research                 is to find systematic methods of determining the scattered wave                 when the two colliding plane waves are given, i.e., methods of                  solving the initial value problem for colliding plane                           gravitational waves.  A related objective is to seek the answers                to certain important questions concerning such collisions.  One                 of these questions is whether the study of colliding plane                      gravitational waves can tell us anything significant about real                 colliding gravitational waves (which are not planar).                                The research, which begins with a reformulation of the                     initial value problem into a certain new kind of Riemann-Hilbert                problem, involves the analysis of this Riemann-Hilbert problem,                 the study of the existence and properties of its solutions, and                 the discovery of practical methods of solving the problem.",
