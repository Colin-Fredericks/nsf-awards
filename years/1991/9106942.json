 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to provide a new                         technique, the deformation method, of generating grids in solving               physical and engineering problems.  The technique is based on                   solid mathematical foundation.  Each grid point in an existing                  grid is to be moved according to a decoupled system of n ordinary               differential equations (n is the number of space dimensions).                   The technique will provide a one-to-one correspondence of the old               and new grid points and thus folding of the grid will definitely                be eliminated.  Moreover, it will provide direct and precise                    control of the cell size.  Thus, it will be adaptive.  Finally,                 the deformation method will be computationally efficient.  In                   particular it will be suitable for parallel computing.                               The research project is aimed to greatly enhance our                       ability to solve  large scale scientific computational problems                 that are crucial to our economy, environment, and security.  For                example, to model the air flow about an airplane, millions of                   grid points must be chosen outside the airplane.  In biology, the               order of components in the human nervous system is a trillion.                  In physics, millions of particles must be analyzed in                           a supercollider.  Even simple models of these problems                          typically require months of manpower to generate grids before                   computers can perform the computation.  The research project will               result in an improved, powerful algorithm for automatic grid                    generation by computer.",
