 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a laboratory to support a \"computer                       literacy\" course based on the problem solving techniques used                   by computer scientists.  This course addresses some of the                      deficiencies in problem solving skills observed in the general                  student body.  Computer scientists want their courses to                        reflect the skills which computer scientists practice.  On the                  other hand, computer literacy courses must also serve the needs                 as perceived by other departments.  Therefore, the course                       employs common forms of applications software as tools.                         Students develop sufficient skills in those tools while                         concentrating on the problem solving aspects of the course.                     The course is aimed primarily to those students who do not                      intend to pursue the field of computer science further, in                      particular education majors.  The  new service course addresses                 serious problem solving or reasoning issues - in the context of                 computer applications.  Formal problem solving techniques are                   presented in a manner understandable by non-technical students.                 These are the same techniques used by computer scientists, and                  other members of the scientific and mathematical communities in                 many aspects of their work.  Students also acquire a knowledge                  of spreadsheets and data bases in a manner analogous to the way                 chemistry students learn about balances and Bunsen burners:                     both are tools used while addressing serious intellectual                       problems.",
