 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at implementing a multipurpose geo-                       techniques training facility for instructing undergraduate                      students in methods used to integrate and display land resource                 and atmospheric information.  Geography majors and students                     from other natural resource programs taking courses in Computer                 Cartography, Remote Sensing, Physical Geography, Meteorology,                   and Geographic Information Systems will utilize the laboratory.                 The integrated approach planned stresses compatibility and data                 interchange between software and hardware providing                             undergraduates with opportunities to exchange data among                        previously incompatible formats.  The requested equipment                       includes microcomputers, software, networking, and hard copy                    generation capabilities which can support a variety of computer                 mapping, remote sensing, geographic information systems, and                    real-time weather analysis activities within a common                           laboratory.  The creation of this lab will greatly increase the                 amount of \"hands-on\" time available to undergraduates.  In                      addition to providing a unique and valuable service to campus                   programs which stress the measurement and analysis of natural                   resources, the lab provides a facility for undergraduate                        students to participate in supervised research activities.  The                 proposed undergraduate laboratory will serve as a prototype to                  test new curricula and as a model for other geography programs                  wishing to develop geo-techniques laboratories which take                       advantage of convergent technologies.",
