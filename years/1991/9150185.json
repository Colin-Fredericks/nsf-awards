 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, sponsored by the University of Alabama-                           Birmingham, provides a six week summer workshop integrating                     the topics of middle-school mathematics and science                             followed by a series of follow-up Saturday workshops during                     the subsequent academic year.  The 50 participants in the                       summer workshop will be paired with another teacher at the                      home school and both will participate in the academic year                      program.  The courses will be taught by teams consisting of                     a mathematician and a math educator and a scientist and a                       science educator.  The courses will emphasize both content                      and pedagogy with hands-on laboratory and field experience.                     In addition the teachers will be instructed in how to                           carry-on leadership out-reach activities and techniques of                      teaching minority students.  The target schools have a high                     percentage of minority students and teachers.  The NSF                          funds are being matched by funds from the University, the                       State of Alabama and the Mott Foundation in an amount                           equivalent to about 16% of the NSF grant.",
