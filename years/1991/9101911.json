 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators will work on problems in dynamical             systems and Riemannian geometry. In particular they will study                  geodesic flows and geodesic stretch on spaces of negative curvature             and on tori. One of their previous results gave a proof of a                    special case of the Hopf conjecture which states that a Riemannian              metric without conjugate points on the torus is flat. They will                 attempt to extend their methods from dynamical systems to the                   general case.                                                                        Riemannian geometry attempts to relate global properties of                manifolds or surfaces such as the topological structure to local                properties such as curvature. The standard method for obtaining                 these relationships has been through the global solution of partial             differential equations. The principal investigators take a                      different tack; they use the theory of dynamical systems defined on             the manifold. This involves the study of iterations of mappings of              the manifold and in their case takes advantage of the structure of              groups of these mappings. If they are successful in developing the              method, it should have application to a wide range of problems in               Riemannian geometry.",
