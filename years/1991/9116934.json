 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program and the Office of Special Projects is made to Dr. Keith                 H. Pannell of the Chemistry Department, University of Texas at                  El Paso for collaborative work in the area of silicon and                       germanium chemistry.  The collaboration will involve members of                 Dr. Pannell's research group and members of the research group                  of Dr. Laszlo Parkanyi of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in                  Budapest.  Because the presence of dicarbonyl(cyclopenta-                       dienyl)iron as a substituent has been shown to promote                          photochemically-induced rearrangements, isomerizations, and                     deoligomerizations of oligosilanes and polysilanes, the details                 of bonding in such systems will be studied.  The method of                      mapping the locations of the silicon atoms will be an X-ray                     technique jointly developed by Drs. Pannell and Parkanyi.  The                  investigation will be extended to include systems containing                    germanium as well as silicon.                                                   %%%                                                                             A method for examining the bonding in polymeric materials of                    silicon and germanium containing metals will be developed.                      Such materials have potentially useful electronic and optical                   properties.  In addition, the project promotes scientific                       collaboration between the United States and Hungary.",
