Soon we will no longer know what these                languages sounded like, or what articulatory gestures their                     speakers used.  Their death will result in a permanent loss of                  data for future linguistic investigations.  This research will                  investigate some of the dying languages that are most important                 from the linguistic point of view.  Another major aspect of this                project is that it will break new ground in providing                           standardized descriptions in quantified form using a set of basis               phonetic measures, designed to characterize both specific and                   universal phonetic features.  The final product will also include               a fieldwork manual for those who wish to do similar work.                       Fieldwork will be conducted in collaboration with local                         linguistics.  The principal phonetic and phonological patterns                  will be identified and illustrated in specially prepared                        material, along with supplementary material illustrating                        coarticulatory and other phonetic phenomena.  The investigators                 will make both audio and physiological recordings including                     aerodynamic records for airstream mechanisms and the timing of                  articulatory gestures, and palatographic records for articulatory               contacts.  Audio recordings will be further analyzed in the UCLA                Phonetics Laboratory.  Fully illustrated and documented accounts                of each language will be published so that knowledge of the                     sounds and the articulatory gestures involved in these dying                    languages will remain available for future researchers and can                  form part of the input to the formation of theories of phonetic                 and phonological universals.",
