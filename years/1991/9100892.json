 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will be               carried out in the Physics Department of The Pennsylvania State                 University at the University Park campus during 1991-                           1993.  The REU site will involve 14 students in research                        projects each summer, 10 funded by NSF and 4 by Penn State.                     Students will be involved in a wide range of frontier research                  projects, consistent with the department's excellent record of                  undergraduate research in all areas of physics.                                      As an REU site, the Penn State Physics Department will mount               an aggressive campaign to recruit students into the                             program, with a wide recruitment area covering Pennsylvania and                 surrounding, mid-Atlantic region states.  Efforts to                            encourage minority student enrollment include a special                         recruitment agreement with the Physics Department at                            Morehouse College, Georgia and making use of contacts with other                predominantly minority universities and colleges in the region.                   There will be special seminars and background courses for                     participating students in order to broaden and reinforce their                  knowledge of physics and to encourage interaction with                          faculty.  Valuable skills, such as machine shop use and                         scientific computing, will also be taught.  Extra-curricular                    activities will be organized to encourage students to interact                  informally with faculty and graduate students.  Throughout the                  program emphasis will be placed on encouraging students'                        interest in careers in physics.",
