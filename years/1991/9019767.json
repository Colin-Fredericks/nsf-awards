 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals use their limbs to generate and transmit forces associated              with movement and suppport against the force of gravity.  These                 forces are an important influence both on the evolution of muscle               and bone design, as well as on the adaptive response of these                   tissues to changes in mechanical loading.  Mechanical requirements              for locomotor support, in turn, affect the energy expended by an                animal during locomotor activity and dictate the limits of its                  performance.                                                                                                                                                    By comparing the mechanics of locomotion of broadly differing sized             species, Dr. Biewener seeks to establish general principles that                govern how natural selection has favored strategies for effective               support of gravitational loads in terrestrial mammals.  One such                strategy appears to be regular size-dependent change in limb                    posture.  By adopting a more upright posture, larger animals lower              the forces that must be transmitted by their muscles and bones when             running.  This decrease in force offsets the diminished ability of              larger animals to support their weight due to the effect of size                on the area to volume scaling of their tissues.  Underlying this                mechanical constraint is the requirement that locomotor stresses                (force per unit area) acting in bone and muscle tissue be kept                  within a safe fraction of each tissue's strength.  The \"safety                  factor\" of these tissues appears to be roughly one-third of their               strength.                                                                                                                                                       This research has applied significance relating to the functional               mechanism and capacity of bone and muscle to respond adaptively to              changes in physical requirements.  This is important in terms of                physical training associated with sports-related activity, physical             therapy programs for recovery from disabling physical injury, for               surgical muscle/tendon transplantation strategies to overcome motor             deficits, as well as for evaluating the importance of physical                  exercise in relation to age-related bone loss.",
