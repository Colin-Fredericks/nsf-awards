 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is a direct continuation and expansion of                  studies conducted under NSF project                                             exploiting findings in that investigation.  One aspect of the                   project centers on the oxidation of the neurotoxic amine MPTP (N-               methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine) and of its                         structural analogs by the two forms of monoamine oxidase )MAO),                 which are known to exist in mammalian mitochondria, and the                     reversible inhibition of MAO A and B by the pyridinium oxidation                products of MPTP analogs.  These tertiary amines are of profound                interest to biochemists, pharmacologists, and neurobiologists                   because in humans, subhuman primates, and certain other species                 they induce neurological conditions essentially identical with                  those seen in Parkinson patients.  Expression of their neurotoxic               action is initiated by the 4-electron oxidation of these                        tetrahydropyridines by either or both forms of brain MAO.  A                    study of the structural requirements of MAO A and MAO B for rapid               oxidation of these tertiary amines has revealed completely                      unexpected facets of the specificities of these enzymes and has                 already yielded major new information concerning their catalytic                properties.  Many more classes of structural analogs remain to                  be tested with these different enzyme forms.  Another aspect of                 the program explores further the mechanism of neuronal death                    caused by the pyridinium compounds formed by MAO.  It is known                  that they inhibit the respiration of mitochondria by blocking the               reoxidation of the flavoprotein NADH dehydrogenase by Coenzyme                  Q. m Structure-function studies under this proposed program                     should greatly increase our understanding of the requirements for               the interaction of MPP+ analogs with NADH dehydrogenase.  We plan               to expand our recent experiments which have demonstrated that the               classical inhibitors of NADH dehydrogenase (rotenone, piericidin,               and barbiturates) bind at the same site and compete with MPP+ and               its analogs.  Extension of these studies to photoaffinity analogs               of MPP+ and congeners is expected to establish which of the                     subunits of the complex NADH dehydrogenase molecular are close                  to the Q reduction site.",
