 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will continue her study of multi-particle                    Hamiltonian, with emphasis on those for atomic and molecular                    systems.  She will consider problems related to the                             monotonicity of energy differences and the variation in the                     number of bound states with parameters such as the nuclear                      charge.  In addition, she will try to use ideas from wavelet                    theory to construct a set of orthogonal functions whose kinetic                 energy is bounded above by a semi-classical functional of the                   one-particle density.                                                             The work in this project is of considerable practical                         importance since it provides the mathematical foundation for                    theoretical atomic and molecular physics, and some is relevant                  to practical computations on atomic and molecular systems.  The                 project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigators'                        enhanced visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In                    this project, the proposed activities which contribute to the                   second objective include:  teaching an upper division course,                   participating in the mathematical physics seminar, and engaging                 in other activities intended to encourage women students at                     Michigan to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences.",
