 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tuluvak Tongue of the Prince Creek Formation, North Slope              of Alaska, contains the highest-latitude flora of Coniacian (middle             Late Cretaceous) age.  Preliminary work suggests that the flora                 probably represents a mixed coniferous forest, and that it contains             a diverse assemblage of angiosperms.  Leaf-margin analysis of                   angiosperms can provide quantitative information on mean annual                 temperature.  The temperature estimates can be supported by                     analysis of the vegetational physiognomy (overall aspect of the                 vegetation, which is strongly controlled by climate) and of the                 growth-ring characteristics in fossil wood, particularly if these               characteristics can be compared with those of under= and overlying              floras.  Thus, the flora of the Tuluvak Tongue provides the                     opportunity to quantify near-polar terrestrial temperatures for the             Coniacian Age.  Because the Coniacian may have been a thermal                   maximum in the Late Cretaceous, based on isotopic evidence from                 marine fossils at lower latitudes, it is particularly important to              understand the climate in polar regions for that time.  In                      addition, comparison of the Tuluvak flora with the floras of the                Albian-Cenomanian Niakogon Tongue (Chandler Formation) and                      Campanian-Maastrichtian Kogosukruk Tongue (Prince Creek Formation)              will help determine whether climate change near the North Pole was              synchronous, within the resolution of the data, with the changes                observed at lower latitudes.  The information gathered from the                 Tuluvak Tongue can be used not only to help establish latitudinal               temperature gradients for the Coniacian Age, but also will complete             the history of near-polar climate change already determined from                older and younger floras in the region.",
