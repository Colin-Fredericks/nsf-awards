 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RUI grant will be used to determine the group theoretical and              crystallographic relationships among the subperiodic subgroups of               the crystallographic space groups and between the subperiodic                   subgroups and the crystallographic space groups to provide a                    systematic, unified theory of these groups.  A standard                         representative group which emphasizes these relationships will be               chosen from each class of subperiodic groups.  A process called                 scanning will be developed and used to determine the orientation                and origin of the subperiodic symmetry group of all planes and                  lines in crystals.  Atom arrangements invariant under subperiodic               groups will be tabulated in the format of the International Tables              for Crystallography.  Lattices of normal subgroups of the                       subperiodic groups, which provide a basis for the derivation of the             images of the irreducible representations of the subperiodic                    groups, will be determined and the irreducible representations of               the subperiodic groups derived.  The subperiodic groups will also               be related to the irreducible representations of the three-                     dimensional crystallographic space groups.  The results of this                 research will be published by the International Union of                        Crystallography.  Parts of the research are being conducted in                  collaboration with Dr. V. Kopsky of  the Institute of Physics of                the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.                                           %%%                                                                             Group theory is important in representing mathematically the                    symmetry inherent in perfect crystals.  Much can be learned about               the physical properties of crystals by understanding their                      intrinsic underlying symmetries. The various types of symmetry                  allowed for three-dimensional crystals is tabulated mathematically              in tables which are of importance to crystallographers and other                scientists interested in the properties of crystals.  In the                    present research the comparable properties of the subperiodic                   subgroups of the crystallographic space groups will be studied and              tabulated.  These subgroups are of interest to scientists                       interested in one-and two-dimensional properties of crystals such               as surfaces or planes and chains.  The results of this research                 will be published as tables by the International Union of                       Crystallography for use by all researchers.",
