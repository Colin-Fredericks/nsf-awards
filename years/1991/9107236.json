 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is to improve our                        understanding of the respiratory adaptations brought about by                   life at high altitude.  In particular, people evidence growth                   plasticity, growing to accommodate the ambient environmental                    conditions.  Generally, the growth differences at high altitude                 appear to be adaptive; ie they help the individual to function                  under hypoxic conditions.  However, not all growth differences                  are obviously adaptive.  For instance high altitude natives have                a lower ventilation rate when exercising at high altitude than do               lowland natives, yet they have higher work capacities than sea                  level natives acclimatized to high altitude.  It is thus critical               to analyze the role of development on a variety of physiological                parameters of adaptation, such as ventilation.                                                                                                                  This project will analyze a number of developmental components of               high altitude adaptation.  Parameters such as residual lung                     volume, ventilation rate and oxygen consumption under maximal                   exercise will be assessed in high altitude Bolivian natives                     living permanently above 3500 meters, lowlanders of European                    descent who are acclimatized to high altitude during growth, and                a group of lowlanders of European descent who were acclimatized                 to high altitude during adulthood.                                                                                                                              The results will help to clarify the mechanisms by which humans                 can adapt through growth processes to life at high altitude.",
