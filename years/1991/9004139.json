 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed focusses on the biochemical                               characterization of nucleotide-protein interactions                             required for maintenance of the 2-5A synthetase/RNase L                         pathway, a vital process in cellular antiviral defense.                         RNase L is distinctive among nucleases in its dependence on 2-                  5A for activation and cleavage specificity at uridylate                         residues.  The molecular mechanism of 2-5A in the binding and                   activation of RNase L will be examined.  To this end, The Pi                    chemically synthesized a new class of metabolically stable                      agonists and antagonists of 2-5A to study the biochemical                       processes for RNA hydrolysis in vitro and in vivo.                              Transmembrane passage of the 2', 5`-phosphorothioates into                      virus infected cells will be accomplished by poly(L-lysine)                     conjugation and the effect of these probes on the stability of                  viral and cellular mRNA will be measured.  In addition,                         experiments are designed to examine (i) the order of addition                   of the substrate and allosteric activator to RNase L needed for                 productive complex formation, (ii) the requirement for                          complementary base pairing between 2-5A and RNA for RNase L                     activation, and (iii) the contribution of each 2', 5'-                          phosphodiester bond in 2-5A to the binding and activation                       processes of RNase L.  Finally, mono- and bifunctional                          nucleotide site-directed affinity labels have been                              synthesized to study the acceptor and 2' -adenylation sites of                  recombinant 40 kDA, homogeneously pure 100 kDa and 110 kDa 2-5A                 synthetases, the ATP binding site of protein kinase, and the                    2-5A binding site of RNase L.",
