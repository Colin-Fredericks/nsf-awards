 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrogen is one of the nutrients essential for phytoplankton                    growth.  The rate of nitrogen recycling can determine the rate                  of primary production.  One of the major pathways of nitrogen                   cycling in the sea is the uptake of N by phytoplankton for                      incorporation into the amino acids and nucleic acids required                   for life.  Traditionally, marine scientists have thought that                   phytoplankton obtain the N they require from inorganic nitrogen                 compounds.  However, dissolved organic nitrogen compounds make                  up a larger reservoir of N in seawater than do inorganic                        nitrogen compounds.  Previously, field studies have indicated                   that amino acids and other organic nitrogen compounds are not                   taken up to any significant extent by phytoplankton.  It has                    been recently suggested that some phytoplankton can oxidize                     amines and amino acids using a cell-surface enzyme.  Oxidation                  of amino acids produces hydrogen peroxide, an x-keto acid, and                  ammonium.  The ammononium is then transported across the                        phytoplankton cell membrane for use as a N source.  The x-                      keto acid is released to the surrounding seawater where it can                  be taken up by bacteria.  If the ability to oxidize amino acids                 by mechanism is widespread among phytoplankton, it has profound                 implications for our understanding of the cycling of amino                      acids in seawater and the competition between phytoplankton and                 bacteria for these compounds.  This project will develop a                      series of fluorescent molecular probes to simulate amino acids                  and amines in seawater.  Loss of the probes (by algal                           oxidation) from seawater can be monitored quickly and                           sensitively by high performance liquid chromatography with                      fluorescent detection.  Using these synthesized probes, the                     importance of phytoplankton oxidation of amines and amino acids                 by this novel mechanism will be tested in the field.",
