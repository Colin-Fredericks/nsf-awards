 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Wichita State University for the repair and renovation of the                   Wichita State Aerodynamic Laboratory which houses research and                  research training activities in aerospace engineering.  This                    building was constructed in 1949 and last renovated in 1982.  The               ARFMP grant of $116,000 and $116,643 provided by the grantee as                 cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve             the current research infrastructure by refurbishing  the wind                   tunnel structure including water proofing the wind tunnel tube,                 replacing its balance system, and modernizing its data processing               system.                                                                                                                                                         This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research, for developing strong linkages to state and regional               industry, and for the training of entry-level engineers from                    several major aerospace companies in the area as well as for the                training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.  Students              trained in the Wichita State Aerodynamic Laboratory, with its                   nationally pre-eminent program in experimental aerodynamics, are in             demand in both basic and applied research fields.",
