 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell-cell recognition is a fundamental biological process which                 underlies many critical developmental events. An example of a                   process which relies heavily on cell-cell interactions is                       fertilization in higher plants. The research described in this                  proposal is designed to contribute to our understanding of the                  mechanisms which are involved in these cell-cell interactions, as               well as to increase our knowledge of how these interactions act                 to regulate the fertilization process. A genetic approach will be               used to identify mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana which disrupt                the process of fertilization and these mutations will be                        characterized to determine which are involved in cell-cell                      interactions. The genes identified by the mutations will be                     cloned using a combination of RFLP mapping and \"chromosome                      walking\". The cloned genes will then be used to characterized the               expression patterns and products of the genes. In a parallel                    project, a small family of Arabidopsis genes showing sequence                   similarity to those involved in self-recognition during                         fertilization in Brassica oleracea will be characterized to                     determine if any members of the family play a role in other                     recognition events during fertilization. By identifying and                     characterizing gene products which are part of the interaction                  process we will learn about the molecular mechanisms of these                   interactions.",
