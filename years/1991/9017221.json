 "awd_abstract_narration": "During  the past few years, there has been  increasing interest in              the development of processing techniques based on the high-order                statistics of the signals. These techniques take into account, in               a systematic manner, the non-Gaussian aspects of the signals.                   Digital communication signals represent a particularly important                class of non-Gaussian signals for which high-order processing                   techniques appear to be well suited. Adaptive channel equalizers                are an indispensable part of modern digital communication systems               which attempt to correct the distorting effect of the channel to                allow higher transmission rates. The objective of the proposed                  research is the development and analysis of high-order processing               techniques, focusing on their applications to communications                    processing. As a particularly promising application of these                    techniques, this proposal presents a novel approach to channel                  equalization, based on recent theoretical results on parameter                  estimation based on high-order statistics developed by the                      principal investigator. The proposal will also investigate other                applications of high-order statistics to communications signal                  processing including signal analysis, signal detection, and signal              design.",
