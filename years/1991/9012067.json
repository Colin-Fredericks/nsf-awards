 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science affects and is affected by politics in many intricate and               important ways.  The history of science has carefully examined the              mutual interaction of human genetics (in the form of eugenics) and              politics in the 20th century.  Dr. Harrington is examining another              important interaction of politics and science:  holism and                      psychology in German from 1918-1945.  In this project, Dr.                      Harrington is concerned with the significance of holism as a                    scientific and cultural phenomenon in the German-speaking life and              mind sciences between the two world wards.  Building on a concept               of holistic psychobiology as \"enchanted\" science, the project makes             use of collective scientific biography to explore holism as a                   reactionary/reformist strain in 20th century science.  As such, Dr.             Harrington argues that holism challenges us with four levels of                 discourse:  (1) experimental/empirical;  (2) epistemological/                   philosophical;  (3)  existential/religious; and (4) ideological/                political.  The roster of individuals chosen to serve as the                    focusing lens of this study are:  Hans Driesch, Jakob von Uexkuell,             Constantin von Monakow, Kurt Goldstein and Max Wertheimer.  By                  setting the lives and though of these men in social and                         institutional context, the book hopes to venture answers to such                questions as:  how far holistic psychobiology represented a                     \"German\" national phenomenon, in spite of international analogues               (how far one can speak of \"national styles\" in science at all);                 the status and influence of holism within the international                     scientific community, both before and after 1933; the relationship              between the scientific holism of the 1920's and certain early 19th              century Romantic traditions (pace the \"back to Goethe|\" rhetoric                of the time); and the relationship between scientific holism and                various political ideologies of the 1920's and 1930's, including                (but not limited to) the political organicism associated with                   National Socialism.",
