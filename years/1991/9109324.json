 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will explore the                use of new techniques to study what are called \"abnormal\" cases in              optimization and optimal control problems that involve nonregular               operators.  These techniques come from functional analysis, and                 they have been applied successfully to treat abnormal cases                     involving the Euler-Lagrange equations and the Pontryagin Maximum               Principle.  The principal investigator is concerned specifically                with determining the limits of these techniques and with obtaining              sharper results than those obtained previously for the derivation               of nontrivial optimality conditions for general extremal problems.                   The derivation and exploitation of optimality conditions for               problems in optimization and optimal control have been one of the               major success stories of the decades since World War II.  These                 results have paved the way for the development of a host of control             systems that have improved the quality of life. More recent                     advances involving robotic systems can be traced to this work as                well.  In this project the principal investigator will examine                  optimality conditions in atypical cases where the traditional                   theory is inadequate.  To do so requires the use of powerful                    methods of abstract functional analysis combined with a thorough                knowledge of classical control theory.",
