 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports Dr. Gombosi's efforts at modeling the                       environments of comets.  The main thrust of the work will be the                further development of a time-dependent, multidimensional dusty                 model of the inner coma.  In addition, new models of the nucleus-               coma interface, the radiative transfer processes, as well as the                plasma environment of the comet will be developed.                                                                                                              The historic encounters with comets Halley and Giacobini-Zinner                 have begun to lead to a better understanding of the major physical              and chemical processes controlling cometary environments.  The                  quantitative and qualitative leap of available information paved                the road to a new generation of comprehensive comet models, which               will synthesize our knowledge in such diverse areas as nucleus                  formation, orbital evolution, gas and dust emission, dynamics and               aeronomy of partially ionized dusty gas flows, and solar wind                   interaction.  A new generation of cometary models will evolve from              a series of intitiatives by various groups and individuals                      simultaneously cooperating and competing.  Dr. Gombosi will be an               active participant in this effort.",
