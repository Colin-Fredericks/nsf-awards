The                                       invention of the Scanning Tunneling Microscope                                  has revolutionized surface science, by providing                                atomic resolution images of surfaces.  It has also                              stimulated the development of a family of new                                   microscopies based on the same approach:                                        piezoelectrically-driven scanning of a probe tip over                           a surface with nanometer/angstrom precision.  By                                utilizing different physical interactions between                               probe tip and sample, these new scanned probe                                   microscopes have demonstrated a range of physical                               measurements, from topography and magnetic                                      imaging to atomic-scale friction and optical imaging,                           all with unprecedented resolution.                                                                                                                              The objectives of this conference are: (1) To bring                             together a select group of people from diverse                                  disciplines, not only those in the forefront of                                 development of these microscopies, and those who                                have pioneered in their application of various fields,                          but also others whose research interests lie in areas                           of potential application; (2) To provide a                                      conference format (a series of plenary sessions                                 interspersed with time for informal discussion)                                 which has proved successful, both in previous                                   Engineering Foundation conferences and in the                                   Gordon Conferences, in promoting synergistic                                    interactions; and thereby (3) To simulate new                                   directions in scanned probe microscopies and                                    techniques, both in applications and in the                                     underlying technologies.",
