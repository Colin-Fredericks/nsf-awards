 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the upgrade of an NCUBE parallel processor to the             next generation NCUBE processor.  The research projects are in                  parallel hierarchical simulation systems for use in computer-aided              design, parallel iterative algorithms for signal processing, and                parallel finite element methods.  The upgraded NCUBE processor is               necessary in order to tackle real world problems.                                                                                                               The computing challenge of the 90's is to put parallelism to work               in solving important computational intensive problems.  The next                wave of super computers will be using thousands to millions of                  individual processors working in parallel to solve problems.  There             must be some mechanism to split the work up evenly amongst the                  processors in order to utilize parallelism to the fullest extent.               This research looks at three problem domains particularly suited                for parallel architectures where each processor has its own memory              and executes its own program.  The first project is signal                      processing for medical image reconstruction.  It is very important              the highest quality images be available for diagnostic purposes and             good parallel algorithms running on a fast parallel processor are               required in order to implement this medical image reconstruction                technology.  The second project involves the design and simulation              of VLSI circuits.  This is a particularly computation intensive                 process that is modular enough so that it can be programmed on an               NCUBE processor.  The upgrade is needed to run the simulations on               real VLSI circuits.  The final project is the exploration of a set              of techniques known as finite element methods for partial                       differential equation solution.  These techniques, when                         parallelized, may exhibit a prohibitive communication cost between              the individual computing elements.  The additional memory and                   better communications on the new NCUBE processor allows further                 exploration of these numerical solution techniques.",
