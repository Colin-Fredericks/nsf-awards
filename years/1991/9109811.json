 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological time keeping is a fundamental property of living                systems.  In mammals, these daily physiological and behavioral                  events, such as sleep/wake cycle, temperature and hormone levels,               are regulated by an internal clock located within the                           suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus.  A fundamental                     question is how this neural clock modulates overt rhythmicity in                response to input signals, such as light.  Recently, Dr. Lynch                  reported the daily pattern of neuronal activity can be altered by               changing exposure to light to resemble that of winter months.                   These data are very exciting because they suggest that this                     neural clock is a flexible, integrative structure and not                       \"hard-wired\" with regard to time.  Using an in vitro preparation                and neurophysiological recordings, Dr. Lynch will now determine                 if the photoperiod-specific pattern is linked to daylength per                  se, or to the action of light at a particular circadian phase.                  Moreover, he will determine how hormone factors, especially                     melatonin, modulate both the firing pattern within the                          suprachiasmatic nucleus and changes in daily behavior (sleep/wake               cycle).  Melatonin, a hormone of the pineal gland, is an ideal                  candidate since it is strongly linked to the control of circadian               rhythms.  This research will significantly enhance our                          understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying circadian and                 photoperiodic events and has important ramifications about the                  plasticity of the neuronal pacemaker.  Findings ways to influence               the neural clock may lead to improved treatments for people with                sleeping disorders and problems caused by jet lag and shift work.",
