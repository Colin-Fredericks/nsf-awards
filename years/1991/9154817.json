This project will plan and conduct a conference whose focus                     is the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science and                        Mathematics Teaching Program.  Conference objectives include                    the facilitation of communication among all the states and                      eligible jurisdictions in regard to:  state, regional and                       national leadership activities; recruitment of candidates                       from historically underrepresented groups; selection                            procedures; opportunities for recognition of state awardees;                    and program management.  Attendees will include the chairs                      of the state selection committees as well as representatives                    from the National Science Foundation, The National Science                      Teachers association, the Council of State Science                              Supervisors and past Presidential Awardees.  Funds will be                      used to support a conference planning meeting, the                              conference itself and a post conference work session.  A                        conference report                                                               will be disseminated by December 31, 1991.",
