 "awd_abstract_narration": "Females of many species, including humans, tend to have lower                   thresholds for sensory stimuli and can perform motor tasks more                 rapidly than males.  Moreover, differences in sensorimotor                      function normally occur during the estrous cycle or menstrual                   cycle and administration of exogenous gonadal steroid hormones                  can mimic these natural changes.  Dr. Becker has evidence to                    suggest that estrogen enhances sensorimotor responsiveness by                   having direct effects on the neurons of the basal ganglia that                  use dopamine as the neurotransmitter.  She will examine this                    steroid-neurotransmitter relationship by analyzing both                         presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of estrogen on the dopamine                system.  By comparing the effects of estrogen on dopamine release               and receptor activity in both males and females, Dr. Becker will                determine whether the known sex differences in sensorimotor                     performance is related to biochemical differences.  Her                         experiments not only enhance our understanding of the                           relationship between hormones and neurotransmitters but also how                these processes modulate basal ganglia function.  Since the basal               ganglia of the brain is involved in a number of clinical                        disorders, including Parkinson's Disease and Huntington's                       Disease, these results have important implications for our                      understanding and treatment of these debilitating disorders and                 other related movement disorders.",
