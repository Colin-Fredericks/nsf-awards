 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in geology                       between Dr. Anne Hofmeister, University of California at                        Davis, and Dr. Pascal Richet, Institut de Physique du Globe,                    University of Paris VI, France.  The objective of the project                   is to improve thermodynamic calculations for mantle-minerals                    based on spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                          One of the fundamental problems in geophysics concerns the                      deduction of the thermal character of the Earth's interior by                   comparing seismic measurements to physical properties of                        minerals measured in the laboratory. Progress is severely                       impeded by infeasibility of performing calorimetry at                           pressure.  In order to overcome this difficulty, predictions                    of thermodynamic properties based on spectroscopy can be                        used. Currently, the calculations are very accurate to 1000                     K, but calorimetric data above such temperature is insufficient                 to evaluate the investigators' current models.  In this                         project they propose to perform calorimetry and thermal                         expansivity at high temperatures and compressibility                            experiments at room temperature (in Paris) and spectroscopic                    measurements at temperature and pressure (at Davis) on                          selected mineral samples. Direct comparison will enable the                     researchers to establish the accuracy of Kieffer's thermo-                      dynamic model at high temperatures. Their goal is to refine                     the model, so that it is reliable under mantle conditions.                      This project will benefit from the complementary expertise of                   the two investigators in modelling thermodynamic properties                     through spectroscopy. The results of this study should improve                  understanding of the thermal state of the Earth's interior.",
