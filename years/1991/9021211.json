 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thermal analysis instrumentation is used for a variety of types                 of experiments, including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),                     differential thermal analysis (DTA), differential scanning                      calorimetery (DSC) and thermomechanical analysis (TMA).  This                   instrumentation is used to determine physical or thermodynamic                  properties of materials in which heat is directly involved,                     such as boiling, freezing and solidification-point                              determinations, heat of fusion and heat of vaporization.  In                    some cases thermal studies include measurment of weight changes                 of a system as a function of increasing temperature.  The                       results of these types of analysis provide meaningful                           information and a deeper understanding of the effects of                        temperature changes on materials.  Thermal methods are used in                  studying materials such as polymers and ceramics.                                                                                                               This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation program                  will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                      Michigan acquire a Thermal Analysis System.  The system will be                 used in the following areas of research.                                                                                                                        \"Synthesis and Characterization of New Fe/S and Fe/Mo/S                          Clusters as Structural Analogs for Metallo-protein Active                       Sites and of Binary Metal Sulfides\"                                                                                                                            \"Characterization of Organometallic Polymers and Surface                         Reaction by Thermal Analysis\"                                                                                                                                  \"Thermal Analysis of Solid-State Intercalation Compounds\"                                                                                                       \"Studies of Solid State Telluride Compounds\"                                                                                                                    \"Characterization of Nanometer-Sized Materials\"                                                                                                                 \"Characterization of New Heteroaromatic Materials Based on                       Cyanoimidazole\"",
