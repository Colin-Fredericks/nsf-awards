The radionuclides that are                    being measured serve as ocean tracers that can yield fundamental                information about the rates of biogeochemical processes that                    govern the scavenging of reactive chemical species and the fate                 of biogenic particles in the oceanic water column.  The study is                designed to test the hypothesis that the uptake and release of                  soluble chemical species by particulate matter and the formation                and destruction of particle aggregates in the oceanic water                     column occur at rates that vary both spatially and temporally in                response to variations in the rate of plankton production at the                sea surface and the flux of organic matter leaving the surface                  layer.  The data will be interpreted within the context of                      biological rate measurements and other data that are being                      collected within the international JGOFS program and will be used               to test biogeochemical models.  This study is expected to                       contribute to a better understanding of particle fluxes and                     dynamics in the ocean, issues that are of broad concern to marine               chemistry, biology and geology.   //",
