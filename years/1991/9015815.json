 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Scheraga is carrying out a combined experimental and                        theoretical research program designed to elucidate the energies                 and mechanism of the folding of a polypeptide chain into the                    native conformation of a protein, and of the action of the                      resulting protein (enzyme or hormone) on a substrate or                         receptor.  While current potential functions are sufficiently                   accurate for several of the applications that he has made, his                  analysis of these potentials (and also of others in the                         literature) indicates that it is time for a completely new look                 at the underlying form ( and parameterization of the                            potentials); this is the first goal of the proposed work.                       Secondly, some very successful methods have been developed to                   surmount the multiple-minima problem for small polypeptides and                 he will devote his efforts to improving them, and extending                     them to globular proteins containing of the order of 100                        residues.  He will test the methods on crambin and bovine                       pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and then use them to compute the                  structure of interferon.  He will also treat large assemblies                   of fibrous proteins, viz. collagen.",
