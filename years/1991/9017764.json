 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quartz sediment provided by various source rocks can be                     characterized on the basis of physical and chemical properties.                 Both have been used to evaluate the sources of quartz sand                      although the physical properties have been emphasized.  Chemical                properties have been used to characterize whole sediment samples                (a mixture of sediment size and mineral composition) or multiple                grains of a single mineral component but generally not for                      individual grains and specifically not for fine-grained quartz.                 Indirect chemical properties observed using subjective                          cathodoluminescence (CL) petrography is applied to individual                   sand grains, but generally not for the finer quartz grains.                     Quartz coarse silt is an important component of mudrocks.  The                  purpose of this pilot study is to characterize attributes of                    quartz not previously determined on these fine particles.  LAMMA                laser microprobe and objective CL petrography will be used to                   document characteristics of quartz coarse silt liberated from                   various source rocks in a single drainage system.  Quartz coarse                silt will be collected from several first order streams each                    draining a single known source rock in the James River drainage                 basin.  This quartz sediment from each source as well as the                    quartz in the source rock will be characterized using the two                   techniques.  This quartz, thus fingerprinted, can then be                       attributed to specific source rocks.  There are two immediate and               major applications of this pilot study.  First, demonstration of                the ability of these techniques to identify source rock of quartz               sediment will allow further studies to determine the dominant                   lithologies contributing silt to modern muddy environments, a                   topic presently debated but possibly not solvable with the                      commonly used tools at present.  Second, because the                            characteristics analyzed by these techniques are not expected to                be affected by diagenetic processes, they have the potential to                 evaluate the sources of silt in mudrocks if it can be shown that                source rock types have unique and predictable characteristics.",
