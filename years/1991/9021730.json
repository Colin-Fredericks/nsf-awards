 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Tennessee at Knoxville for the repair and renovation              of Middle Dabney Hall which houses a major proportion of the                    research and research training activities of that institution's                 Chemistry Department.  This building was constructed in 1954 and                has not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of                     $1,700,000 and $4,910,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing               will be used to modernize these research and research training                  facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                  current research infrastructure both in terms of increasing its                 safety and of increasing the quantity and quality of research that              can be conducted by upgrading the heating, ventilation, and air                 conditioning (HVAC) system and by installing fume hoods, solvent                cabinets, and casework.                                                                                                                                         This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of undergraduates from other institutions through              the Science Alliance and National Science Foundation summer                     research programs as well as for the training of the University of              Tennessee's own undergraduate and graduate students.",
