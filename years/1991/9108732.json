 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mammalian nervous system is analogous to an electrical wiring               system that sends messages to all parts of the body.  The axon is               an exceptionally long \"electric wire\" extension of the neuron and               conducts the electrical signals generated in the nervous system.                Though it is not fully understood how axons reach their targets,                it is known that axons expand as a result of the slow movement of               its front end, the growth cone.  As the growth cone slowly moves                around the body, the axon lengthens from behind.  Filamentous                   proteins of the cytoplasm, actin, microtubules, and intermediated               filaments compose a dynamic skeletal structure for cells, that                  underlies the ability of axons to elongate.  This research                      project will focus on describing the motility of the                            lammellipodial growth cone.  Mechanical tension is expected to                  regulate the cytoskeleton during axonal elongation.  This ideas                 is supported by thermodynamic considerations that suggest the                   assemble of filaments is affected by mechanical forces.  The                    relationship between mechanical tension and two other known                     stimulators of axonal elongation; nerve growth factor and                       electrical fields will be investigated to determine whether                     growth signals transduce through tension or act independently.                  In conjunction with these studies, the Principal investigator                   will study the assembly of microtubules during the process of                   axonal initiation and ascertain what chemicals are responsible                  for the motility of growth cones by using tension measuring                     methods.  These cytomechanical investigations will provide new                  insight in understanding axonal development in the nervous                      system.",
