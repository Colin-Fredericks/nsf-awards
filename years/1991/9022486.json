 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project analyzes data on about 4500 corporations in 18th and               19th century Russia.   The data were collected under a previous                 NSF grant, 8419943, published in several articles and a book by                 the PI.  This new project is interdisciplinary, involving his-                  torical and sociological methods, and sociological and economic                 theories of how organizations grow and die.  Factors include the                impact of culture and politics on the growth and structure of                   organizations.  Specific variables include credit policies,                     tariffs, subsidies, and legal changes.  The goal is to develop an               understanding of what produced the distinctive features of early                Russian capitalism.  The analyses apply organizational theories                 of ecological climate and 'permanently failing corporations,' and               provide information on their applicability beyond the framework                 of American capitalism.  After completion of the project, the                   data set will be available for other research projects by other                 scholars.",
