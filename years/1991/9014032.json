 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Clarence A. Miller of Rice                        University to collaborate with Professor Heinz Hoffmann of                      the Physical Chemistry Department of the University of                          Bayreuth, Germany.  They will carry out joint research on                       equilibrium and dynamic properties of surfactant systems                        that will build on and enhance their ongoing independent work                   on surfactant dynamics..  The two laboratories will share the                   work of determining equilibrium phase behavior of systems                       containing a particular zwitterionic surfactant in pure form                    plus various hydrocarbons and straight-chain alcohols.  Then                    each laboratory will conduct experiments suited to its                          specialized equipment to elucidate other behavior in systems                    containing the same zwitterionic surfactant under different                     chemical and physical conditions.  Dr. Miller's laboratory                      will use videomicroscopy to investigate the dynamic behavior                    that occurs when surfactant solutions contact oil.  Dr.                         Hoffmann's laboratory in Germany will measure rheological,                      electric birefringence and other dynamic response properties                    of pure phases for a number of systems.  Such techniques have                   never been applied to the L3 phase.  Comparing the results                      with theoretical models is sure to advance fundamental                          understanding of the microstructure of this phase.                                                                                                              The general objective of this joint work is to obtain a                         better understanding of certain phases in surfactant systems,                   especially the so-called L3 phase, an isotropic liquid phase                    which occurs in a variety of surfactant systems under                           conditions quite different from those where ordinary micellar                   solutions are found.  The collaborators will also examine the                   lamellar liquid crystalline phase, which exists over a wide                     range of water content and presumably has a wide range of                       rheological behavior.  Relating the morphology of this phase                    to the data on physical properties from the German measurements                 should provide a better understanding of the manner in which                    new phases, such as the lamellar liquid crystal, form at the                    initial interface between aqueous surfactant solutions and                      oil.  Such knowledge will have a variety of practical                           applications.",
