 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Ofer Bar-Yosef, Mr. Daniel Lieberman,                a graduate student in Anthropology at Harvard University, will                  collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  His goal is to                     determine the seasons in which prehistoric \"Natufian\" sites were                occupied and to accomplish this he will combine analysis of                     archaeological faunal remains with controlled experimentation.                  The Natufian period (12,500 to 10,500 bp) immediately precedes                  the development of agriculture and therefore it is likely that                  adaptions which occurred during this earlier time set the process               in motion.  Archaeologists have postulated that the Natufians                   were the first people in the region to settle and occupy single                 sites year round and that this factor plays a major role.                                                                                                       A large body of prior research indicates that cementum - a tissue               which attaches the tooth root of mammals to the bone is deposited               continuously over the life of an animal.  It often appears as                   alternating lighter and darker bands which are correlated to                    season of the year.  However, the mechanisms which underlay the                 apparent relationship are not well understood and it is unknown                 whether changes are related to factors such as seasonal variation               in diet hardness, diet quality or reproductive status.  In order                to apply this technique in a meaningful way to the large series                 of gazelle remains recovered from many Natufian sites, Mr.                      Lieberman will conduct controlled studies on goats in which diet                hardness and quality is varied and effect on cementum growth                    noted.  He will also study goats and sheep with known                           reproductive histories.  On this basis, he will then examine                    archaeological materials.                                                                                                                                       This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed                   increased insight into the process which led to the domestication               of plants and animals - one of the most fundamental \"revolutions\"               in human history.  Secondly, it will assist in the development of               an analytic technique which may be used by many scientists for a                wide variety of purposes.  Finally, it will further the training                of an extremely promising scientist.",
