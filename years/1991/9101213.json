 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biochemistry at                  Colorado State University to establish a Research Experience for                Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The program in Molecular Biosciences                will enable qualified undergraduates to spend a summer doing                    independent research projects in a range of areas and using a                   variety of experimental approaches.  Biochemistry/molecular                     biology employs the methods of chemistry, physics, cellular                     biology, microbiology, and genetic manipulation to study the                    structure and function of complex biomolecules, how these                       molecules generate the phenomenon we call life, and how                         alterations in these molecules perturb the living organism.                     Because of its breadth, biochemistry/molecular biology serves to                integrate didactic and experiential material learned in a                       multitude of basic science courses.  The REU program is designed                to \u0131a! offer the participants a wide variety of research areas                  from which to choose an independent studies project; \u0131b! offer                  project areas that are meaningful and exciting to the student;                  \u0131c! teach the student how to formulate and test hypotheses; \u0131d!                 help develop the ability to trouble-shoot and problem-solve when                confronted with the unexpected; \u0131e! instruct the participant in                 state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation of                              biochemistry/molecular biology; \u0131f! develop the ability to                      communicate with one's peers concerning ongoing research efforts                as well as more formal presentations of completed research                      projects; and, \u0131g! provide, in CSU faculty and in outside                       scientists invited to speak to the REU students, role models that               will reinforce the intellectual excitement of a scientific                      career.",
