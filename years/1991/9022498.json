It is expected to involve 150 to 200 participants from major                    engineering employers, the Congress and other policymaking bodies,              professional societies, and the press.  Emphasis has been placed                on the recruitment of women and minorities as presenters for this               meeting.                                                                             The meeting will begin with an assessment of current                       predictions as to supply and demand for engineers.  This will be                followed by a session examining some of the factors that will                   influence engineering in the future, including technological                    changes as well as demographic trends.  Then, the meeting will turn             to more detailed consideration of these matters, in sessions                    devoted to implications of the trends for policymaking at both the              national level and at the level of employers of engineers in                    industry, services, government and education.",
