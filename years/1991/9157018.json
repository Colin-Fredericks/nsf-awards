 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator grant involves the study of                complex fluids and mesoscopic systems.  In particular research will             be conducted in three general areas.  First, on equilibrium and                 nonequilibrium properties of crystalline liquids, studies will be               made on the role of fluctuations in the vicinity of flow-induced                non-equilibrium critical points; on the spectrum and properties of              interfacial excitations; and on the effects of fluctuations in thin             films of pre-nematic fluids.  Second, in the area of novel quantum              effects in mesoscopic systems, studies will be made on                          geometrically-induced persistent currents in metallic rings and                 extensions to quantized fields including photon and phonon                      currents.  Finally, Josephson effects in discs and other topologies             will be studied.                                                                %%%                                                                             This Presidential Young Investigator award will involve research on             topics of current interest in condensed matter physics.  Studies                will be made of the properties of liquid crystals - a state of                  matter intermediate between a solid and a liquid.  In particular,               the effects of fluctuations on the properties of the liquid crystal             as it changes from one phase to another will be studied.  Research              will also be conducted in the area of mesoscopic physics which is               a region intermediate between those in which quantum mechanics                  applies and in which classical physics applies.  This is a region               which is becoming accessible as devices become smaller.",
