 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the First Buenos Aires Workshop on                          Analytical Chemistry to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina                      from November 12-16, 1990.  The organizer is Daniel Batistoni                   of the analytical chemistry department of the Argentine Atomic                  Energy Commission.  The U.S. organizer is Ramon Barnes of the                   University of Massachusetts.  The aim of this workshop is to                    bring together local and international scientists active in                     different fields of analytical chemistry.  Exchange of ideas                    and discussions will be stressed between research units,                        government laboratories and industry.  The program will                         include plenary lectures, invited oral presentations on                         selected topics, and oral or poster presentations of                            contributed papers.  The workshop also includes discussion                      panels on specific subjects, four tutorial lectures, and a                      limited instrumental exhibition.  It will stimulate the                         initiation of new professional contacts and long term                           associations between U.S. and Latin American scientists who                     share common research interests.                                                                                                                                The proposed research-oriented program is focused on modern                     topics in analytical chemistry including instrumental                           analysis techniques; flow injection and kinetic methods of                      analysis; quality assurance; toxicology, biological, and                        environmental analysis; and the analysis of materials.  The                     workshop will promote scientific exchange and collaboration                     in the specific areas of advanced spectroscopic techniques                      for elemental analysis at trace and ultratrace levels as                        applied to the characterization of new materials; flow                          injection and kinetic methods of analysis, and quality                          control in analytical laboratories.",
