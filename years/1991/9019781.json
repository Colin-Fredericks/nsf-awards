This will be augmented each year by ongoing special                     Institute Fellowships which provide full support for three                      minority students pursuing Ph.D.s in Physics.  All six                          graduate students participating in this Minority Scholar                        Program will be designated as Graduate Scholars.  Many of the                   Department's undergraduates are introduced to physics                           research through MIT's Undergraduate Research Opportunity                       Program (UROP), which is recognized as a national leader in                     university research programs for undergraduates.                                  This proposal also requests funds to support five                             Undergraduate Scholars selected competitively from the                          under-represented minority students.  Undergraduate Scholars                    supported through the Minority Scholar Program will work                        closely with individual faculty supervisors.  Historically,                     the UROP program has been very effective in involving                           undergraduates in stimulating, front-line physics research.",
