 "awd_abstract_narration": "Last decade has seen an increasing demand for use of underwater                 robotic vehicles for various ocean applications, for example                    pipeline laying, inspection, repair, geological survey, etc.                    Reliability safety, flexibility, and economics are amongst some of              the major factors that demand the development of intelligent                    Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs).  This permits more efficient use             of the vehicle, operator, and their support ships.  The ultimate                goal is the realization of systems with all the intelligence                    required to function autonomously in a variety of undersea tasks.                                                                                               One general capability essential to building some degree of                     autonomy into the ROV systems is accurate sensing of position and               movements relative to a fix coordinate system or nearby objects.                A particular application, as these vehicles become more widely                  used, is near-bottom stationkeeping; that is, maintaining a desired             position to perform some task near ocean floors.  With the current              technology, near-bottom stationkeeping can be done via active                   sensing, using acoustic or optical beacons that need to be                      positioned accurately on the ocean floor, and recovered upon                    completion of the task.  This is costly, tedious, and highly                    impractical in applications where active sensing is to be avoided.              This three-year project involves the investigation of an                        alternative solution to the problem, passive optical sensing by                 exploiting the bottom natural features as beacons.  The goal is to              develop computer vision techniques for extracting information about             position and motion of the vehicle by interpreting images of the                undersea environment.",
