 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Workshop on Discrete Event Systems (DES) is being                             held during the weekend of June 21-23, 1991.  The field                         of DES emerged in the early 1980's as an effort to                              extend classical system and control theory to discrete-                         state event-driven dynamic systems and to solve many                            critical technological problems commonly encountered                            in areas such as manufacturing, computer systems, and                           communication networks.  Although the field has                                 reached a stage of healthy maturity, it is still young and                      multidisciplinary in nature.  The proposal for this                             Workshop stems from a broad-based interest to bring                             together people from both academia and industry who                             are actively involved in DES research.  The main                                objectives of the Workshop are:                                                                                                                                 (a)   to consolidate contributions to date and explore                                the field's potential for practical impact on                                   existing and future technologies,                                                                                                                         (b)   to stimulate interaction among DES researchers                                  from different disciplines and varying schools of                               thought,                                                                                                                                                  (c)   to expose students to ongoing activities in the                                 DES field and foster their interest,                                                                                                                      (d)   to identify benchmark problems forming the                                      targets for future research directions.                                                                                                                   The Workshop is to be conducted in an informal but                              well-structured setting, emphasizing open discussions of                        critical technical issues and tutorial presentations.  It is                    planned for approximately 50 people from various                                disciplines including systems and control, operations                           research, industrial engineering, and computer science.",
