The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds               for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                      conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support                for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the                deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational                equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                        receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                          communication equipment including radio transceivers and                        satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                            communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                  for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                                                                                                   The Project Director, George G. Shor is fully qualified to direct               this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the               acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.                                                                                                            This project will allow the institution to install a Sea Beam                   2000 Multibeam Echo Sounder on the R/V MELVILLE.  In addition to                the NSF contribution, total costs are being shared by the Scripps               Institution of Oceanography, the Office of Navy Research and the                Keck Foundation.",
