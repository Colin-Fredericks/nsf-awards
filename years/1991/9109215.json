 "awd_abstract_narration": "Connectionist networks, which compute via the massively parallel                cooperative and competitive interactions many simple neuron-like                processing units, provide a unified framework for studying cognitive            processes and their neurological implementation.  The proposed                  research involve modeling acquired reading disorders in patients with           brain damage by developing and \"lesioning\" a connectionist model of             normal reading.  Based on data from psychology and neuropsychology,             the model has two routes for deriving the pronunciation of a printed            word: a phonological route that maps directly from orthography to               phonology by \"sounding-out\" the word, and a semantic route that maps            indirectly via semantics by \"recognizing\" the meaning of the word.              Preliminary connectionist implementations of each of these routes in            isolation have succeeded in reproducing a limited range of normal and           abnormal reading behavior.  It is proposed to develop a complete                dual-route model capable of addressing a much wider range of                    phenomena, relating to the coordination and relative contribution of            each route during reading acquisition, mature skilled reading,                  behavior after partial damage, and recovery from damage.  The model             will be developed within a more neurophysiologically plausible                  connectionist formalism than the one used in the previous work.  In             addition, a major research effort will focus on developing an                   adequately sophisticated semantic system that overcomes the severe              limitations of existing systems.  High-performance computing                    facilities will be used to meet the extensive computational demands             of training and testing the model.",
