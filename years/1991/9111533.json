 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to fund the participant costs              of 6 graduate students and 8 postdoctoral research associates to                attend the 14th triennial International Conference on Plant Growth              Substances, organized by the International Plant Growth Substance               Association (IPGSA).  The conference covers many subject areas                  including plant metabolism, plant development, gene regulation,                 signal transduction, plant stress, host-pathogen interactions,                  biotechnology and agricultural applications.                                                                                                                         The importance of the attendance of young U.S. scientists at               this meeting is twofold.  First, the science is top notch and                   scientists come away with enhanced training.  The second is the                 international aspect and the ability of young scientists to engage              foreign colleagues.  A major, high-quality book of the proceedings              will be published.//",
