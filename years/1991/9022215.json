 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Reiss is supported by a grant from the Experimental                   Physical Chemistry Program for the experimental and theoretical                 investigation of nucleation, the process by which an aggregate                  of molecules too small to be observed becomes the nucleus upon                  which other molecules condense in the vapor phase, which leads                  eventually to the formation of a liquid droplet.  The                           experiments are carried out in a cloud chamber, and the goal is                 the understanding at the molecular level of the physical                        cluster itself and the physical process by which it is formed.                                                                                                  The theoretical and experimental studies in this research                       involve a molecular theory of vapor phase nucleation, capable                   of quantitative prediction of critical supersaturation for                      homogeneous nucleation in single and multicomponent systems                     under conditions of practical interest.  Studies of vapor phase                 nucleation of vinyl polymers will be based on the same theory.                  The theory involves the identification of the physical cluster                  consistent with the physical process of nucleation and the                      analysis of that cluster with Monte Carlo simulation.",
