 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workshops on microfabrication are being provided for 150                        undergraduate faculty over a two year period.  These workshops                  teach the technology used for the manufacture of integrated                     circuits, disk read-write heads, sensors, and other miniature                   devices.  Hands-on laboratory experience, under the direction of                experts in the field, are emphasized.  The subject matter is highly             interdisciplinary, appropriate for faculty from most science and                engineering departments.  The workshops are particularly                        appropriate for teachers of introductory courses in materials                   science and engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry and                  chemical engineering, and physics.  Teachers of general science                 courses for non-science majors are encouraged to attend. The focus              is on experienced teachers without significant prior                            microfabrication skills.                                                                                                                                        Participants leave the workshops with the skills required to                    provide microfabrication demonstrations and experiments to their                own students. Participants are encouraged to join in the                        development of a laboratory manual and  are invited to follow-up                workshops for improvement of experiments.",
