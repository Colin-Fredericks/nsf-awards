 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change               Research Program (Our Changing Planet,\" Committee on Earth                      Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                      environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                    Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                     Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                 initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                 of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                  properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                 geospace model with predictive capability.                                           The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                             magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                   connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                   ionosphere.  The magnetopause is the boundary between the shocked               solar wind plasma in the magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasma.               Magnetic reconnection and anomalous transport at the magnetopause               are key  mechanisms for the transport of solar wind plasma into                 the magnetosphere, whose understanding is a priority of the                     Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Program.                                         The goal of this grant is to develop a model of turbulence                 fluctuations and transport in the magnetopause current layer                    which can be coupled with simulations of collisionless                          reconnection and compared with observations.",
