 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed effort is to eventually                                fabricate a high resolution and high brightness thin                            film cathodoluminescent phosphor screen for high                                performance display applications.  In order to achieve                          this, the Phase I experimental results indicate that it                         is possible to fabricated rare-earth-doped CaS thin                             film phosphor screen directly on high resolution fiber                          optic faceplates exhibiting a screen resolution of 114                          1p/mm.  In addition, it has been shown the quantum                              efficiency of aluminized thin film CaS screens is                               comparable to that of well developed ZnS-type                                   powder phosphor screens.  In the proposed Phase II                              effort, additional optimization of various thin film                            preparation parameters will be carried to further                               improve screen performance and to establish                                     processes for eventual Phase III manufacturing.  The                            Phase II effort will also consist of fabricating high                           performance image intensifiers using the new thin                               film technology.  Image tube fabrication and                                    evaluation will be performed by Varian Associates                               Electron Optical Sensors Division.  It is expected that                         the prototype image tube will exhibit superior overall                          performance to similar tubes containing optimized                               powder phosphor screens.",
