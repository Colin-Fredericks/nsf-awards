 "awd_abstract_narration": "The possible changes in global climate caused by human activities               are a matter of great scientific interest and also have grave                   implications for the world economy and social order.  Study of the              subject began in the mid-nineteenth century and continued                       intermittently for the next hundred years.  In the early 1950s, the             impact of human activity on global climate came under sustained                 scientific investigation.  Further, this scientific study                       increasingly reached the eye of the public.  By the late 1980s,                 when policy makers began to take an interest, there was a long and              rich history of research, achievement, and controversy.  This                   history has never been studied systematically and is largely                    unknown.  Dr. Weart is determining the main features of the history             of research into human impact on climate.  He is also studying how              this scientific work has related to public understanding of the                 problem.  This study aims not only for publication of results in                historical and scientific journals, but also at preservation--for               use of future researchers--of materials documenting the subject--               materials now dispersed and liable to destruction.  This project                promises significant contributions both to the social scientific                study of human dimensions of global environmental change and to the             history of science and technology.  Consequently, this project is               being supported by the Division of Social and Economic Sciences and             the History and Philosophy of Science Program.",
