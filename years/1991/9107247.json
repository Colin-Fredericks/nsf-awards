 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most studies of tropical rain forests have intentionally                   been conducted on relatively homogeneous sites.  However, sudden                changes in forest composition, structure, and dynamics can occur                with abrupt changes in soils in lowland tropical forests.  The                  importance of such changes and local soil-type heterogeneity for                the maintenance of tree species diversity in tropical forests is                unknown.  A spectacular example is Lambir National Park, Sarawak.               This forest, undisturbed by humans, is perhaps the most species-                rich tropical forest in Southeast Asia.  Establishment of a                     permanent 50 ha plot is proposed, to straddle a major soil                      discontinuity at Lambir in order to compare and contrast tree                   population patterns, and eventually demography and forest                       dynamics across the soil ecotone.  The \"source-sink\" hypothesis,                namely that rare species in the forest on one soil type are                     sustained by immigration from abundant populations on the other                 soil type will be also tested initially through comparison of                   population structure on contrasting soils of species occurring                  across this ecotone.  These tests are important for understanding               the specialist vs. generalists strategies of tropical tree                      species in relation to soils, for the maintenance of rare species               in tropical forests, and for the conservation of tropical forest                biodiversity.  This project is co-sponsored by the Sarawak Forest               Department, and by the plant ecology laboratory of Osaka City                   University.  The project will train a new generation of resident                and U.S. experts in one of the world's richest floras.",
