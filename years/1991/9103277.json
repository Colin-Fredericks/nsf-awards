 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with unresolved fundamental problems                 associated with the charge-density-wave (CDW) transition, namely                the nature and effects of fluctuations in the neighborhood of the               CDW transition and secondly the nature of the very weak impurity                interactions with the CDW.  The role of phonon entropy on the                   thermodynamics of the CDW transition will be studied.   Improved                specific heat, elastic, and magnetization measurements will permit              a more careful confirmation of scaling laws.  A novel resonant                  ultrasonic method will be used for simultaneous evaluation of all               components of the elastic modulus tensor as a function of                       temperature.  Presently, thermodynamic measurements do not yet                  confirm the criticality temperature range shown by x-ray                        diffraction.  Susceptibility measurements will be attempted to                  further explore the validity of the scaling laws.  It is hoped to               provide experimental evidence on the influence of fluctuations on               charge and heat transport and to compare these results with                     thermodynamic quantities.  A second portion of the research is                  concerned with the synthesis of patassium molybdate with isotopic               substitution on the oxygen (0) site with the obtainment of well                 controlled ratios of 180/160 or 170/160.  Both transport and nuclear            magnetic resonance measurements will be undertaken to obtain                    evidence on the pinning of the CDW.  A search for the effects of                the isotopic substitution on the CDW phase transition will be made.             This will be the first attempt to explore isotopic effects on CDW               systems.",
