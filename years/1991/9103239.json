 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study problems in the theory               of completely integrable systems and their supersymmetric                       extensions as well as problems in the theory of ordinary                        differential equations arising from the integral systems. The goal              of the research is to determine the algebraic structure of the                  infinite dimensional set of solutions to an integrable system and               relate this structure to the moduli space of algebraic curves.                       A completely integrable system is a collection of geometric                and algebraic data at each point in a space which defines a                     collection of surfaces which fill up the space much as the pages in             a book fill space. In general the pages or leaves are not flat as               they ordinarily would be in a book but curved as they would be if               one twisted the book. The way in which the leaves are twisted is                described by the data provided by the integrable system. The                    surfaces or leaves of the system may be thought of as the solution              set of a differential equation with different leaves corresponding              to different initial conditions. The principal investigator will                attempt to understand the solution spaces by using methods of                   algebraic geometry.",
