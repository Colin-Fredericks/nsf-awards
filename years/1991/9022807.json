 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with establishing some of the econometric             theory for predicting from models involving time dependent                      conditional variances. Specifically, the intention is to examine                the form of the optimal predictor of the conditional mean and the               conditional variance equations; their mean squared error (MSE) and              their associated multi-step prediction density. Initial work that               has been undertaken has given rise to analytic expressions for all              the moments of the conditional mean prediction density from a                   univariate autocorrelated process with GARCH (1,1) innovations. The             project will extend these results for more general processes and                will attempt to derive some fairly general results for the                      prediction of future conditional variances. It is anticipated that              there will be many applications of these results in asset pricing               models and option pricing models, where prediction of future                    volatility is likely to be important an important component of the              asset price. Applications will also be made to the relationship                 between stock market indices and the real business cycle.",
