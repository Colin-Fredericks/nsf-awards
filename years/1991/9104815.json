The method is based on                                                 separately estimating the                                                       probability distribution of flood                                               volumes and the distribution of                                                 flood peaks conditioned on volume.                                              Preliminary results from the upper                                              midwestern United States indicate                                               that flood volumes are very well                                                behaved compared to peaks, and                                                  suggests that regionalized                                                      estimates of their probability can                                              be extrapolated more credibly than                                              can the estimates of probability of                                             flood peaks.  These results will be                                             tested using flood data from other                                              regions of the United States as                                                 well.  Various methods of                                                       regionalizing the distribution of                                               flood volumes also will be                                                      explored.  In estimating the                                                    distribution of flood peaks                                                     conditioned on volume, the                                                      deterministic watershed modeling                                                will be used in the formulation and                                             estimation of the statistical                                                   model.  This approach will be                                                   developed and applied to one or                                                 more drainage basins.  The                                                      watershed model will incorporate a                                              one-dimensional, full dynamic flood                                             routing model in order to capture                                               the impact of floodplain storage on                                             flood wave propagation.  The                                                    results of this work will improve                                               the understanding of basic                                                      rainfall-runoff-flood probability                                               relationships, and will result in a                                             significant reappraisal of                                                      techniques used in risk analysis of                                             major engineering water projects                                                and existing structures.",
