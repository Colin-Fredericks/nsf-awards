The first phase of                               the proposed study will develop devices on                                      semiconductor heterostructures employing two basic                              configurations and will characterize the conductance                            modulation and current-voltage characteristics                                  associated with Coulomb blockade effects in the                                 device.  The experimental results will be compared                              with predicted trends in order to validate the                                  predictions and to evaluate the feasibility of                                  proposals for more advanced structures.  The                                    second phase of the study will investigate advanced                             devices based on this effect.  Devices based on                                 several proposed configurations will be developed                               and evaluated.  Proposed transistors of this type are                           expected to offer better gain and speed                                         characteristics than conventional devices and are                               expected to operate at more reasonable                                          temperatures and voltage levels than those required                             for mesoscopic structures.",
