 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue the measurement and recording of radio               waves at Palmer Station, Antarctica.  The principal experiment                  involves the monitoring of transmissions from distant very low                  frequency (VLF) transmitters, and using variations in the amplitude             and phase of the received signal to deduce changes in the                       properties of the atmosphere along the great circle route between               the receiver and transmitter.  In particular, lightning strokes                 produce waves that can penetrate into the magnetosphere where they              interact with energetic electrons in the van Allen radiation belts.             Some of these particles can be precipitated into the upper                      atmosphere where they cause a sudden change in the conductivity,                and therefore a perturbation in any radio wave that may be                      propagating through that part of the atmosphere.  Thus, the                     monitoring of the transmitter signals can be used to map out                    lightning induced atmospheric disturbances that are thousands of                kilometers away.  The investigators will also operate equipment                 that will monitor natural sources of radio waves, such as the                   sferics produced by lightning.                                                                                                                                  Stanford University and the principal investigator are leaders in               research on very low frequency radio waves and their interaction                with the geospace environment.",
