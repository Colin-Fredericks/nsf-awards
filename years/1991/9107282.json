 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, an accessible burial                  chamber for Native American skeletal materials will be                          constructed at the Sunwatch site in Ohio.  Archaeological                       excavation at this site yielded a series of human skeletal                      remains consisting of 175 individuals which were recovered from a               number of areas within the circular stockaded village.  The                     collection is important because it appears to date from a 10-20                 year period and thus reflects an extremely limited (in an                       archaeological sense) slice of time.  Therefore, it is of great                 interest to biological anthropologists.                                                                                                                         Given religious sensitivity of many Native American groups,                     however, it has been proposed that these (as well as other)                     remains be reburied.  The Dayton Museum of Natural History which                curates the skeletons has worked with a Native American group and               proposed an ingenious solution.  A simple, locked underground                   crypt will be constructed at the Sunwatch site itself near a                    visitors center.  The skeletal remains will thus be interred in                 what is viewed as their proper context.  They will, however, be                 available for study by qualified experts including both                         scientists and Native American religious leaders.                                                                                                               This project is important for two reasons.  It will make access                 to scientifically important materials available on a continuing                 basis.  It will also provide an example of how skeletal materials               may be treated to accord with both scientific and religious                     concerns.",
