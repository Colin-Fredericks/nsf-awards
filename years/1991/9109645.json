 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project extends the investigators' research on the solution                theory of cooperative games in which binding agreements can be                  implemented with a large number of players and nontransferable                  utility games.  It consists of four parts.                                                                                                                      Part I deals with the Harsanyi non-transferable utility value for               which payoffs to players are both egalitarian and utilitarian.  It              studies the relation between these values and Walrasian equilibria              in perfectly competitive economies.  Part II investigates the non-              cooperative foundations for cooperative solutions.  In a non-                   cooperative setup, binding agreements are not possible.  But this               does not rule out cooperation among the participants if it is in                the interest of everyone to follow the agreement rather than                    defect.  Since non-cooperative behavior is the more basic and                   primitive concept and cooperation could arise only if it is                     supported by non-cooperative behavior, it is important to                       understand and look for non-cooperative foundations to cooperative              solutions.                                                                                                                                                      Part III deals with models of incomplete information and cheap talk             - communication that is \"free.\"  The research seeks to characterize             what is achievable by the simplest form of communication that                   requires no external devices such as binding agreements and                     mediators.  Part IV proposes to study several topics in incomplete              markets theory: the existence problem of equilibria when there is               a continuum of states, the determinacy problem when there are too               many equilibria and the efficiency problem of an incomplete market              equilibrium.                                                                                                                                                    This project covers a wide spectrum of important issues in                      equilibrium analysis.  These analyses will lead to a much better                understanding of various solution concepts, and of the interplay                of communication and strategic interaction among agents.  It will               provide a strong foundation from which many important questions                 concerning cooperative and non-cooperative behavior can be                      addressed.",
