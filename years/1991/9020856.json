 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coordinate eukaryotic gene regulation may be induced by                         interactions of specific regulatory factors with DNA and protein                components of the basal gene promoters.  Detachment of the flagella             of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii rapidly induces transcription of                   tubulin and other flagellar genes nearly 10-fold above basal levels             of expression, making this an ideal system with which to study such             regulatory interactions.  To determine DNA sequences required for               deflagellation-induced expression tubulin and other non-tubulin                 flagellar protein genes will be modified for identification,                    deleted to retain varying lengths of 5' and 3' flanking regions and             intervening sequences, and introduced into Chlamydomonas by                     transformation.  Expression of the modified genes will be analyzed              in control and deflagellated cells.  Regulatory elements will be                located by correlating loss of inducibility with specific                       deletions.  Independent confirmation that the regulatory sequences              identified in gene sequences identified in gene transfer studies                confer inducibility will be obtained by analyzing the interaction               of protein factors will these in vivo and in vitro.                                                                                                             These studies will provide the basis for analyses of the signalling             and regulatory mechanisms coordinating expression of this large,                diverse set of flagellar genes in response of deflagellation.",
