 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant is concerned with the development of                   culturally relevant mathematics and science curriculum for                      Native Americans.  The project involves two trips to gather                     information for the development of a full research proposal.                    The investigators are to take two Native American students to                   the University of Illinois to study techniques developed in                     the Calculus/Mathematica Project.  The ultimate goal of                         this project is the determination of methods for making                         educational software and, in general, the traditional                           mathematics and science curriculum more relevant for Native                     Americans.  This grant also funds travel by the principal                       investigators to the Mathematics and Educational Reform                         Workshop to be held at the University of  Arizona, March                        21-24, 1991.                                                                         This project represents a significant step in terms of                     attracting and retaining Native Americans in the science and                    engineering pipeline.  Often Native American tribal customs                     prevent young children from learning mathematics and science                    in the traditional Western manner.  The focus of this project                   is to find methods for introducing cultural relevance into                      educational software for Native Americans. It is recognized                     that there is a vast variety of Native American tribes and                      customs.  This project focuses on the Lummi tribe with a view                   towards methods for extending the techniques for other                          tribes.",
