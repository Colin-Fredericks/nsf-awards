 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has always been assumed that pollen characters are                      determined by the genotype of the plant (from the classic nature-               versus-nurture argument, pollen traits are assumed to be totally                determined by 'nature').  However, recent experiments have shown                that the environment can have important effects on pollen                       characters.  For instance, work with wild radish demonstrated                   that pollen from plants grown under nutrient-limiting conditions                sired fewer seeds than pollen from control plants.  This proposal               is centered around measuring the genetic and environmental                      contributions to variation in pollen traits in Silene alba, white               campion, a common weed in the eastern United States.  The pollen                traits are pollen number per flower, pollen size, percent of                    pollen that has aborted, and the ability of pollen to sire seeds.               Most of the work will consist of documenting how much natural                   variation in these traits exists in fields around New Jersey and,               through transplant experiments, how the same genotype performs in               different environments.  The result will a precise measurement of               the genetic and environmental contributions to a variety of                     pollen traits, and perhaps to paternity itself.",
