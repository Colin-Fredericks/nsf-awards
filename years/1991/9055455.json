 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project teams elementary school teachers with middle                       and high school teachers who are veterans of a previous                         project (ASSIST: TPE-8751767) in a summer institute for                         science teachers to be held at the University of Michigan                       Biological Station.  The summer program will be                                 characterized by flexibility and options to meet the varying                    needs of veteran and new participants.  During the first                        year following the summer session, participants will                            implement in their classrooms one or more of the units                          introduced during the summer session.  During the second                        summer, secondary and elementary teacher teams will work                        with their respective administrators to develop a program of                    professional development to be implemented in their schools.                    Project staff will provide support and site visits during                       the first year of implementation.  Formative and summative                      evaluations, a Winter Reunion, site visits by staff, and                        assessments when units are implemented are means by which                       the project's effectiveness will be evaluated.                                  This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because it (1) is designed to enhance the science                       knowledge and teaching of elementary school teachers through                    a emersion in a nature setting as they explore biological                       concepts and phenomena and learn appropriate methodology and                    materials to use in their elementary school classrooms; (2)                     provides veterans (high school teachers) of a previous                          enhancement program the opportunity to deepen and build upon                    knowledge acquired during participation in that program; and                    (3) contains an amplification plan which will be developed                      and implemented by teams composed of veteran (high school),                     and elementary teachers, and their school administrators.                                                                                                       Non-NSF cost sharing is $61,524 or approximately 11% of the                     amount requested from NSF.",
