 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this research is to apply immunogenetic                knowledge already acquired in the domestic fowl toward preserving               the genetic health of captive avian species, especially those in                danger of extinction.  In the chicken there are 12 genetic loci or              gene complexes producing antigens on erythrocytes and, more                     recently some five additional loci determining lymphocyte                       specificity have been discovered in this laboratory.  These genetic             systems of polymorphic genes are potentially beneficial in several              respects.  Some of the gene systems have distinct physiological                 effects.  The B system is the major histocompatibility complex                  (MHC) of the chicken and is of prime significance in both humoral               and cellular immune response.  The B system serves as an example                of a multi-gene complex in which individuals inheriting two                     different B gene complexes are at a survival advantage because of               more effective immune defense.  The other more highly polymorphic               systems are to be examined for specific effects on survival under               exposure to naturally occurring diseases.  Other systems encoding               lymphocyte antigens are known to interact with the MHC in the                   overall immune response to environmental stimuli.  The unique                   genetic stocks and reagents developed for specific immunogenetic                objectives make possible interdisciplinary research with colleagues             in related areas--restriction fragment length polymorphisms,                    natural resistance to environmental disease organisms, genome                   mapping, and the use of alloantigen gene systems as markers in                  monitoring individual fitness.  Finally, studying these multigene               systems in avian populations over time will enhance our                         understanding of their function in the evolution of birds.                                                                                                      This research will apply immunogenetic knowledge obtained from                  study of chickens to develop new knowledge of the immunological                 recognition systems of several wild bird species which currently                exist in very limited numbers.  This will be done by identifying,               on the surfaces of red and white blood cells, specific families of              molecules involved in immune recognition.  An immediate practical               benefit of being able to identify the immunological recognition                 systems in captive bird species is their use in a simple blood test             to check pedigree information to avoid accidental mating of closely             related individuals, and thus to maximize the genetic diversity of              small populations. This information will contribute to our ability              to preserve the genetic health of captive bird species, especially              those in danger of extinction.",
