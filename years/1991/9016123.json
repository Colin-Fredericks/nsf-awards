In particular efforts will address matrix and                       matricial iteration theories and the theory of                                  synchronization trees.  These efforts should yield new                          knowledge of equational properties of formal power series                       and a new treatment of total correctness.  Collectively the                     results are expected to help unify a body of work in                            theoretical computer science, expressed inside a framework                      of iteration theories.                                                                                                                                          This project in computational theory fulfills the program                       objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                      combine complementary talents and share research resources                      in areas of strong mutual interests and competence.",
