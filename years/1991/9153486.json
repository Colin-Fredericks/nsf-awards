 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northern Arizona University has formed an articulation with                   seven elementary schools, each with a predominantly minority                    student enrollment, that will improve the quality of science                    teaching in those schools by developing and supporting teams of                 teachers, Resource Specialist Teams, in each school to                          implement good science programs.  The program is a model that                   is providing the following training opportunities for the                       Resource Specialist Teams:  (1) enhancement of multicultural                    awareness so that teams can incorporate culture-based science                   into major concepts and themes in their teaching; (2)                           interdisciplinary content enrichment so that teachers can                       develop organizing concepts in science using topics from all                    disciplines in their teaching; (3) enhanced translation of                      teachers' content knowledge into the development of a                           constructivist perspective of learning that guides curriculum                   development and teaching strategies.  The project staff are                     providing  the following support systems to implement the goals                 and objectives of the training:  (1) development of Resource                    Specialist Teams as a model for the utilization of the minority                 school as the effective unit for improvement of science                         education; (2) assistance for the Resource Specialists Teams                    with implementation of curriculum, access to resources and                      information; and (3) establishment of an effective delivery                     system of Teacher Networked Teams throughout the region.",
