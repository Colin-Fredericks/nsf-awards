 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support,  Dr. Dean Snow will                   obtain 44 radiocarbon dates on materials from Native Aboriginal                 Mohawk sites which date from the 16th and 17th Centuries A.D.  He               has very carefully selected maize samples which are clearly                     associated with site occupation and these will be submitted to                  the University of Arizona accelerator laboratory which has the                  ability to analyze small samples.  On this basis, he hopes to                   date 48 sites - each to within a decade.  Long term                             archaeological work has provided excellent data on the early                    historic Mohawk peoples; most settlements are known and their                   size has been determined.  Before it is possible to estimate past               population sizes, however, and determine how these changed over                 time, accurate dating is necessary.  At the present time, inexact               and relative ages are based on the nature and amounts of European               trade goods which are present.                                                                                                                                  In light of the Columbian bicentennial, increasing attention has                been focussed on the interactions between Native American peoples               and European colonizers.  While it is clear that introduced                     diseases had a major effect on Native Americans, both the process               and the extent have yet to be determined.  Some anthropologists                 and historians believe that populations were decimated and that                 in prehistoric times the number of inhabitants were many times                  those observed by early settlers.  Others argue that North                      America was never that densely populated and the effect of                      disease is significantly less.  The data to decide clearly                      between these alternatives, however, is lacking.  In this                       context, Dr. Snow's Mohawk work is extremely important because                  the quality and extent of the archaeological work in this area                  should allow good estimates of changing population over time.                                                                                                   This work is important for several reasons.  It will increase our               understanding of the early history of Mohawk peoples.  It will                  also provide new insight into the processes of population contact               and resulting change.",
