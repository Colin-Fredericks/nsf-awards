 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genomic RNAs of some plant viruses contain tRNA-like structures             at their 3' ends.  There is a highly developed tRNA mimicry, with               aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and elongation factor interacting                     efficiently with the Viral RNAs.  The advantages to the virus of                this elaborate tRNA mimicry remain unclear, but are probably                    involved in (-) strand synthesis, the first step of the viral                   replication cycle.  The goal of this proposal is to understand the              function of the tRNA mimicry for turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV).             The 82 nucleotide-long tRNA-like structure of TYMV specifically                 accepts valine and appears to include the (-) strand promoter.  We              have shown that alteration of the -CAC-valine anticodon to a non-               valine anticodon results in dramatic loss of valylation in vivo.                Experiments are proposed to test whether the anticodon is important             (a) primarily in directing the valylation of the viral RNA, or (b)              because it is an essential recognition element of the (-) strand                promoter.  TYMV replicase will be purified in order to determine                which subunits- viral or host-encoded (e.g. elongation factor) -                are responsible for the recognition of the tRNA-like structure as               promoter.                                                                                                                                                       While mimicry at the phenotype level has been recognized as a                   biological phenomenon for many years, mimicry at the DNA level is               new and unexpected.  The information resulting from this award                  should give some insight into cause.",
