 "awd_abstract_narration": "Risk management on offshore platforms requires real-time adaptation             of procedures to existing conditions.  These conditions can be                  caused either by environmental factors(e.g., storms or ice),                    on-board incidents(e.g., a fire), boat collisions, or degradation               of the platform or its capacity(e.g., by corrosion.)  In situations             of risk, the operators generally follow procedures that have been               predesigned, but some specific circumstances may not have been                  foreseen in the design of the procedures.  An experienced operator              can generally estimate the severity of a situation similar                      to one he has experienced previously and take appropriate measures.             In some instances, however, more information is needed about the                current risk situation, potential deterioration of this condition,              applicable procedures, and alternative options before appropriate               actions can be taken.  The object of this research is to combine                the powers of analytical methods (probabilistic risk assessment                 based on systems analysis) and artificial intelligence (expert                  systems based on recommendations of experienced operators and on                operating/emergency procedures) in a hybrid real-time decision                  support system for risk management on board platforms.  A key                   theoretical issue is the aggregation of these two types of                      information.  A prototype will be developed.  One possible option               for this prototype is to address the problem of safety management               for a redundant platform when the weather conditions make both                  delayed and immediate maintenance hazardous.",
