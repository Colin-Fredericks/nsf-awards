 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project involves planning activities for the design,                        synthesis, and study of novel multimetallic complexes                           withdesirable light absorbing and electrochemical properties.                   Mixed-metal multimetallic complexes of the platinum group                       metals (Rh, Ir, Os, Ru) which incorporate polypyridyl bridging                  ligands will be synthesized.  These systems are expected to                     have very complex electronic spectra and electrochemistry due                   to their multicomponent nature.  The electronic spectra will                    contain transitions well into the visible region of the                         spectrum, due primarily to low energy metal-to-ligand charge                    transfer transitions.  In addition, intense pi-pi star                          transitions will be evident in the ultraviolet region for all                   polypridyl ligands contained in the system.  The                                electrochemistry of these systems is expected to be dominated                   by metal-based oxidations and bridging and nonbridging ligand-                  based reductions.  For systems containing rhodium or iridium,                   metal-based reductions are also expected at relatively low                      potentials.  Through the systematic variation of the metals as                  well as bridging and non-bridging ligands, it will be possible                  to gain insight into the nature of the photochemical and                        electrochemical processes.                                                      %%%                                                                             Research Planning Grants enable women who have not had prior                    independent Federal research support to develop a competitive                   research proposal.  This project involves the study of the                      photochemical and electrochemical properties of metal complexes                 containing more than one metal center.  The knowledge gained in                 this study will enable better design and preparation of                         mixed-metal complexes with specific light-absorbing properties.",
