 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects of                      government training program on trainees and to analyze the                      determinants of income inequality .  Special attention is paid to               selection bias in this analysis, and the study will develop a                   theoretical foundation for developing estimating models that take               into account this bias.  The research will include three empirical              studies utilizing these models.  The first will use recently                    available experimental and non-experimental data to evaluate the                impacts of the leading Federal manpower training program--the Job               Training Partnership Act.  The objective of this study is to                    ascertain the determinants of program awareness among the eligible              population, the determinants of application, enrollment, placement,             and long-run labor outcomes of the program.  This study will                    present new insights about the effectiveness of the job training                program.  The second study will examine the effects of                          randomization in evaluating social programs.  Finally, the third                part will investigate the sources of wage inequality utilizing new              methods for measuring inequality.  This research is important                   because it will develop new methods for evaluating social programs,             and it will provide new insights about the problem of income                    inequality.",
