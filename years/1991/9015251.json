 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is currently no way for knowledge based reasoning systems                 to handle inconsistent information, although inconsistent                       information arises in many important application such as medical                diagnosis and other expert systems.  Most often during the                      construction of a knowledge based system, if the knowledge                      engineer is presented with information, which may come from a                   number of sources, that is inconsistent, the knowledge engineer                 simply chooses, sometimes incorrectly, to discard certain                       piecesof information that have been identified as the cause of                  the inconsistency.  The consequence of such a practice may be                   disastrous since first of all the engineer may be throwing away                 important information and secondly, in may instances, the                       existence of inconsistent knowledge may itself convey important                 information.  However, since most reasoning systems are based                   onclassical two valued logic, they have no way to correctly                     handle inconsistent information.  A class of logics call                        annotated logics has been proposed by several researchers as an                 alternative model or reasoning that allows for inconsistencies.                 These logicshave been shown to provide nice, theoretical                        foundations to a variety of formalism in computer science.  This                work will study the use of annotated logics as a practical                      computational model.  It will implement annotated logic systems                 that can serve as an environment in which knowledge based                       containing inconsistencies can be built and in which inferences                 can be computed.  This work should provide a nice bridge across                 the gap that currently exists between the theory and the                        practical utility of annotate logics, and provide a reasoning                   basis for many important practical applications.",
