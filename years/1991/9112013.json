 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory that \"water-stress\" improves the nutritional                    quality of plants for insect herbivores and leads to outbreaks                  has received much support.  Although studies report improved                    performances for insects fed water-stressed foliage others have                 shown that insects either avoid or grow poorly on water-stressed                plant.  It appears that Orthoptera and sapfeeding insects tend to               benefit from plant water-stress, but leaf chewers and                           skeletonizers do not.                                                                The P.I. Will test the hypothesis and that the effect of                   water-stress in plants on herbivorous insects depends on the                    feeding mode of the insect.  He will perform preferences and                    controlled rearing experiments examine the effects of water-                    stress in the host plant on feeding and oviposition preference,                 growth, survival, and fecundity in ten insect species distributed               among three feeding guilds and four insect orders.  Soybeans will               be the experiments since the physiology and biochemistry of                     soybean under water-stress is well known.                                            These experiments will enhance our knowledge of the                        interactions of soybean with several of its insect pests, and                   allow the identification of the effects of water-stress in plants               on insects herbivores depends on insect feeding mode.  This                     information will help explain the complex responses of insects to               water-stressed plants.",
