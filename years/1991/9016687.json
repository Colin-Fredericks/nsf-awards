 "awd_abstract_narration": "The supernova phase of evolution in massive stars is important to               understand because it is during this violent stage that most of the             heavy element atoms in the Universe are created, including the                  iron-group of elements responsible for life, and the generation of              magnetic fields in planets.  Supernova SN1987a is arguably the most             intensively studied object outside the solar system since its                   explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud was first observed in early             1987.   Already studies of this object, the first bright supernova,             in the modern era of astronomy, have uncovered several surprises,               for example, that stars that become supernovae can be red in color              rather than blue, as astronomical theories have predicted.                      Moreover, Supernova SN1987a, being one of only two supernovae to                be studied continuously since its outburst, furnishes a unique                  opportunity to understand the very early evolution of a supernova,              e.g., over the first decade.   The Principal Investigator (PI)                  proposes to construct theoretical models to explain the emission                of light from SN1987a using the most up-to-date information on                  shock wave physics.                                                                                                                                             Although it is thought that the slowly fading light outputs of most             supernovae are powered by the radioactive decay of unstable nickel              and cobolt isotopes, several details of the light output in SN1987a             rule out this possibility.  The PI intends to focus on this problem             in this program and to construct numerical models to that would                 include effects by the most likely alternative mechanisms:   (1.)               interaction of the exploding supernova gas shell with material                  lingering near the star that was previously part of a \"stellar                  wind\" ejected by unrelated causes, and (2.) the generation of a                 second shock wave caused by the birth of a magnetized neutron star              (pulsar) as a consequence of the supernova explosion.   The answer              to this question is expected to affect our understanding of a                   significant fraction of supernova during their early phases, and                will have a critical bearing on attempts to understand later stages             of supernovae.",
