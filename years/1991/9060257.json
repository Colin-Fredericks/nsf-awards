 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this investigation is to address software                      architectural issues which will facilitate the implementation of                advanced finite element technology for parallel and distributed                 computational processing systems and to produce a prototype                     software system for use in demonstrating and benchmarking the                   techniques  investigated.                                                                                                                                       The software architecture to be developed will permit an                        evaluation of the applicability and feasibility of a variety of                 concepts related to finite element methods for solid mechanics                  analysis which have shown promise as a result of recent research                in engineering, mathematics, and computer science including:                    hp-version finite element methods, adaptive meshing using non-                  conforming elements, solution of systems of simultaneous partial                differential equations for medium-grained distributed memory                    parallel processing systems.  A prototype implementation will                   utilize object-oriented software design and  programming methods                and network and parallel computing methods to demonstrate                       adaptive hp-version finite element technology for the solution                  of 3 dimensional linear static elastic problems.  Techniques                    investigated will lead to the development of new tools capable of               solving more challenging non-linear problems.  These tools are                  important to the nation's ability to design and produce safe,                   reliable, and cost-competitive products.",
