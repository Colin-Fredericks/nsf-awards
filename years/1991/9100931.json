 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to The Savannah River Ecology                       Laboratory (SREL) to continue their Research Experiences for                    Undergraduates SITE for another two years.  The program will                    provide research experience, training and career perspective for                undergraduate students through the use of SREL's unique field                   sites, laboratory facilities, and the association and active                    involvement in research with full-time research ecologists.                     Project participants will examine the influence of by-products of               nuclear and fossil fuel energy production on selected biological                and chemical properties in southeastern ecosystems.  SREL faculty               members, all actively engaged in research and publication, will                 be paired with students having compatible research interests.                   Student projects, while distinct and independent, are portions of               ongoing research programs of SREL.  The student experience is                   enhanced by interaction with a programmatic team comprising                     individuals with a diversity of ecological backgrounds,                         interests, and ideas.  Applicants from minority schools and                     regional institutions with limited research programs will                       continue to be actively encouraged, as in previous years.                       Participant selection is based upon the quality of an                           application, letters of recommendation and academic record.                     Through the research training of more than 420 undergraduate                    participants over the past 23 years, SREL has created a highly                  successful program of student/advisor interaction.  Scientific                  publications and career development of former participants attest               to the success of the program.",
