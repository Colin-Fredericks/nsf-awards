 "awd_abstract_narration": "A laboratory is being developed for teaching two concentration                  courses: Computer Organization and Principles of Design for                     Large Systems.  The laboratory consists of a network of three                   NeXT workstations, with an additional workstation for faculty                   development work.  The new lab uses a combination of the C                      programming language, with its low-level features, together                     with MC68040 assembly code in the Computer Organization course.                 Simulators are used to work with microcoding and I/O and                        interrupt facilities.  The new equipment enables the use of                     UNIX tools for controlling the development of large projects.                   In the Design course, C++, which comes with the NeXT, is used                   to introduce and provide the facilities of object-oriented                      programming in the design process.  By having the workstations                  connected via an ethernet, students are better able to                          coordinate their work for large system design projects.  A new                  course, Computer Modeling: A Tool for the Mind is being                         developed.  In this course, the computational speed and the                     accessible user interface of the NeXT enables the non-science                   students to be introduced to the important current applications                 of computer science such as artificial intelligence, cognitive                  science, chaos theory, and, in general, the \"information                        processing\" paradigm for thought.",
