 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research activity is designed to develop the theoretical              and experimental knowledge base to enable the development of the                next generation metal cutting machine tool.  This machine tool is               characterized by the properties of high speed, high power, high                 accuracy and high static and dynamic stability.  The                            characteristics of high speed and power are necessary to reduce                 costs involved in machining.  The key to achieving this goal is the             development of statically and dynamically stable machine tool sub-              systems, integrated to form a highly stable machine tool.  Sub-                 systems such as stiff high speed spindles and new-material, light-              weight, stiff structures will be researched and developed.  Major               control issues, such as spindle speed control to avoid chatter and              servo systems with continuous updating of drive dynamics to reduce              following error, will be addressed.  Modelling and simulation of                machining processes will be conducted, on a large scale, to allow               the incorporation of these models into further development of                   Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing systems.                                     The research is focused on developing models of machine tools              for the aerospace and automotive industry, which represent the two              largest segments of manufacturing.  Systematic research of this                 nature cannot be provided by the domestic industry which is                     extremely fragmented and battered by overseas competition.  This                work will however, provide for a revival of the domestic machine                tool industry, through cooperation and technology transfer, while               greatly benefiting a major segment of the manufacturing sector of               the United States.",
