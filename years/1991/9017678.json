 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed studies focus on one of the yeast vacuolar protein                 sorting (VPS) genes, VPS15.  The predicted product of the VPS15                 gene shares significant sequence similarity with the catalytic                  domains of the family of serine/threonine protein kinases.  Using               both genetic and biochemical approaches, the following will be                  analyzed:  (1) the functional role of myristoylation on Vps15p                  function and localization, (2) the subcellular location and                     possible site of action of the Vps15 protein, and (3) the presumed              kinase activity of the VPS15 gene product.  It is anticipated that              these studies will result in a detailed view of the organization                and control of vesicular traffic between the Golgi and the vacuole,             and possibly other inter-organelle transport events in eukaryotic               cells.                                                                                                                                                          The process of selective recognition, sorting and transport of                  proteins from one intracellular organelle to another via vesicular              carriers represents an essential feature of all eukaryotic cells.               The precise mechanisms and machinery that direct these processes                are not yet known.  This laboratory has isolated a large collection             of yeast mutants that exhibit severe defects in protein delivery                to the lysosome-like vacuole.  The defective genes in these mutants             are likely to encode components of the cell's protein sorting                   apparatus.  Toward an understanding of the molecular and                        biochemical basis of the vacuolar protein sorting (\"vps\") defects               in these mutants, this research will characterize the roles certain             of the VPS genes and their products play in the sorting and                     delivery of vacuolar enzymes from the Golgi complex to the vacuole              in yeast.  The fundamental similarities between yeast and other                 eukaryotic cells in their pathways for protein delivery, together               with the powerful genetics and molecular approaches available in                yeast, make yeast an ideal organism for addressing these problems.",
