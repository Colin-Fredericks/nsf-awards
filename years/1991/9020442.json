 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aquatic Hemiptera are a worldwide group with a relatively                  mature taxonomy, which permits use in addressing questions of                   evolution and zoogeography.  Although richly represented in all                 tropical regions, they attain their greatest diversity in the                   Malay Archipelago between Asia and Australia, where they have                   radiated to produce numerous locally endemic species.  Within                   this archipelago, the island of New Guinea is of particular                     zoogeographical interest due to its composite geological and                    biological nature.  The island was formed through tectonic                      suturing of disparate parts, essentially the opposite of                        fragmentation and vicariance, and the fauna is derived from both                temperate Gondwanian and tropical Laurasian sources.  As a                      result, its faunal relationships have been difficult to depict on               simple dichotomously branching cladograms.  The intention is to                 address this problem by combining classical cladistic                           biogeography with a relatively new method involving cladogram                   character analysis to investigate the composite nature and                      relationships of the Papuan fauna.                                                                                                                                   The proposed study will be divided into five separate phases               that form a logical continuum:  Faunal survey, systematic                       revisions, character analysis, phylogenetic analyses, and                       zoogeographical hypothesis testing.  During the granting period,                the plan is to complete revisions and cladistic analyses of 19                  genera in 4 families, containing a total of approximately 300                   species.  These taxonomic works will concentrate on groups that                 are most informative from a biogeographical standpoint, and will                use extensive recent collections from New Guinea combined with                  collections from other museums.  The zoogeographical analysis                   will rely on both previously published studies and the new                      phylogenies to be generated during the course of this project.                  Several  explicit zoogeographical hypotheses will be tested                     regarding the relationship of New Guinea to Australia, the                      Philippines, New Caledonia, and the central Malay Archipelago.                                                                                                       The basic data on systematics and distribution generated by                this study will be of use to scientists interested in taxonomy,                 biodiversity and conservation.  The comparison of methodological                approaches will provide new insights into the analysis of                       zoogeographical data, and the zoogeographical conclusions will be               of interest to those concerned with faunal interchange and                      distribution in areas of tectonic plate collision.  Finally, the                results will provide useful comparative information for                         geologists studying the tectonic evolution of the Malay                         Archipelago.***",
