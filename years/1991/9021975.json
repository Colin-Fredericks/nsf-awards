 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray crystallography of biological macromolecules is an                        increasingly important tool to understand structure, function,                  and control.  Developments in genetics, data collection, and                    computer hardware have produced an unprecedented growth of                      crystallographic studies.  X-ray crystallography produces large                 amounts of data and is entirely dependent upon the availability                 of powerful computers and sophisticated algorithms for the                      interpretation of raw data.  After crystallization, data                        collection and phasing, a large variety of computational                        procedures are required in order to solve and refine the                        structure.  These procedures include methods of phasing, density                modification, chain tracing, refinement, and correction of errors               in structures.  Recent publication of partially erroneous                       structures has drawn everyone's attention to the difficulties                   involved at these stages of the crystallographic structure                      determination pathway.  It is the goal of this proposal to                      develop a comprehensive, machine-independent, and user-friendly                 program system for all computational aspects of macromolecular                  crystallography.  Previous experience with the program X-PLOR                   will proved a framework for the proposed software development.                  The specifications of the proposed software development are open                to discussion at a workshop that has been organized by the                      principal investigator and that has been attended by 30 leading                 researchers in crystallography.  The propose software will                      significantly reduce the time required to obtain structures and                 will increase the reliability of crystallographic structure                     determination.",
