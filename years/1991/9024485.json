 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an earlier research poject supported by the National                    Science Foundation, a triple-path denuder (TPD) assembly for                    ambient sampling of sulfate and/or nitrate compounds was                        constructed.  This device contains a series of denuders and                     filter packs which is intended to permit sampling and protection                of sulfate nitrate particles obtained from polluted urban                       atmospheres for species analysis by x-ray diffraction techniques.               In the current project, further laboratory tests are planned:  1)               the ability for this TPD instrument to collect artificially                     prepared aerosols of nitrates and sulfates; 2) to determine the                 lower limit of detection of these materials; and 30 to assess the               extent to which the denuder systems of the TPD protect the                      samples from artifact reactions.  Additional sampling at Denver,                Colorado, is planned to test the system in actual field                         conditions where significant urban chemical products of this                    nature are known to occur.  The proposal also includes                          quantitative analysis of the collected particulate matter by x-                 ray reference intensity and x-ray fluorescence procedures.",
