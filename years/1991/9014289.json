 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to an outstanding group of investigators              who study organismal structure with particular attention to that                of vertebrates.  The funds will be used to purchase microscopes,                video cameras and recorders, computers and specialized computer                 software need for modern morphometric analysis.                                                                                                                 Although the study of structure is a long established area of                   biological investigation, the recent remarkable progress in studies             of molecular and subcellular organization has somewhat eclipsed                 studies of higher level organization at a time when the application             of computers has permitted increasingly sophisticated quantitative              morphology.  The coupling of video equipment to microscopes                     together with the use of computers for storage and analysis of the              video data has been the key element of progress in this area.  The              study of morphology continues to provide key insights into the how              and why of organismal evolution, and to out understanding of                    adaptation of species to their environments.  This award recognizes             the continuing importance of the study of morphology and of the                 importance of modern instrumentation in these studies.",
