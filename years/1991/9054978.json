 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project will be conducted at the University of Puerto             Rico, Mayaguez, and will serve a cadre of twenty teachers of                    mathematics, fourteen at the secondary level and six at the middle              school level. All teachers will come from the Mayaguez area. The                project will provide two years of teacher education in the area of              statistics, which has recently been added to the secondary                      curriculum in Puerto Rico. During a six-week summer institute, the              teachers will learn statistical concepts and pedagogical strategies             through projects and activities. Current curriculum materials such              as the Quantitative Literacy Series will be introduced. Staff                   includes university statisticians and school personnel with                     expertise in pedagogy. During the academic year, staff will visit               the teachers' classrooms to provide support and assistance as the               teachers implement the statistics course. In addition, teacher                  participants will conduct dissemination workshops with their                    colleagues as needed and as appropriate. This project is                        significant in its likelihood of building a cadre of teachers with              strong statistics expertise in the Mayaguez area.                                                                                                               Cost sharing is provided by the University as 10% of the NSF                    request.",
