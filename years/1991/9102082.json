 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the research of Professor P. Sarnak as                 principal investigator and Dr. Zeev Rudnick as a post-doctoral                  associate.  Professor Sarnak will work on the spectral theory of                automorphic forms and its applications to number theory and                     combinatorics.  He hopes to make progress towards the general                   Ramanujan conjecture.  Dr. Rudnick is working in automorphic                    forms.  He intends to apply techniques derived from the study of                automorphic forms to counting integer points on affine varieties.               He is also investigating the behavior of Euler products.                             This is research in the field of number theory broadly                     conceived.  Number theory starts with the whole numbers and                     questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by                       another.  It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it was               originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within               the last half century, it has become an essential tool in                       developing new algorithms for computer science and new error                    correcting codes for electronics.",
