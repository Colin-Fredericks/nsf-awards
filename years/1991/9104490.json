 "awd_abstract_narration": "Friction between air and a ground surface affects both the                 velocity of winds and the configuration of materials on the                     ground.  The higher winds are above the surface, the less their                 velocities are retarded by surface friction.  The height above                  the surface at which surface friction ceases to affect wind                     velocities is its aerodynamic roughness length, but this height                 varies in relation to the nature and configuration of surface                   materials.  This doctoral dissertation project will examine                     the spatial variation of the aerodynamic roughness length as                    measured over natural terrains, and it will develop a tool to                   predict the aerodynamic roughness length by remote sensing.                     Field data will be obtained under natural conditions:  the                      aerodynamic roughness length will be derived from wind profiles                 corrected for atmospheric stability.  The topographic surface                   roughness will be measured in the field using a variety of                      methods to assess both micro-topography and the overall                         topography.  The relationship between variations in wind                        veolcities and the aerodynamic roughness length will be studied                 using traps that capture airborne sediment.  The project also                   will examine means of analyzing aerial radar images for several                 wavelengths and polarizations to determine their utility in                     estimating aerodynamic roughness.                                                                                                                                    This project will provide valuable information about the                   aerodynamic roughness length and thus about wind activity that                  affects erosion processes, desertification, and the nature of                   windblown sands.  In addition, greater knowledge about the                      aerodynamic roughness length will contribute significantly to the               refinement of global and regional climatic models.  This project                also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young                scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.",
