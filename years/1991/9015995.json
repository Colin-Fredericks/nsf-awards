 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in                               atmospheric chemistry between Dr. Mark Kritz, State                             University of New York at Albany, and Dr. Joseph Sanak,                         Centre des Faibles Radioactivites, Gif-sur-Yvette,                              France.  The objective of this project is to incorporate                        Krypton-85 measurements, made by the French research                            team, into a US program in which vertical profiles of                           radon, ozone, CO, water vapor and aerosols will be                              collected over northern California.  The observations                           will be used to document and study episodes of rapid                            long-range transport of Asian surface-level air, and                            will aid in the verification of global circulation and                          chemical transport models.                                                                                                                                      A series of upper tropospheric radon measurements made                          aboard a C-41 aircraft used in this research revealed                           systematic, rapid transport of Asian boundary layer air                         to the upper troposphere near California.  These                                transports could also be a significant factor in the                            global distribution and budgets of chemically active                            species and aerosols.  The profiles to be acquired in                           this program will span the altitude range 1-11 km and                           will be used to document and study trans-Pacific                                transports in the mid and upper troposphere.  Because of                        its long (10.76 year) half-life, dominance of northern                          hemisphere sources and low stratospheric abundances, the                        Krypton-85 measurements will be a valuable adjunct to                           the research program.  In addition, the Kr-85 observations                      themselves will represent a significant increase in the                         number of free tropospheric observations of this                                radionucleide, and will add to our knowledge of its                             atmospheric distribution and behavior. Since its inception                      the French laboratory has been among the pioneers in the                        use of natural radionucleides to study the oceans and                           atmosphere.  This project will benefit from the                                 significant expertise on this topic to be provided by                           Dr. Sanak and his research team.",
