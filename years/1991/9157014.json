These catalysts are much more                    active in dehydration, dealkylaltion and disproportionation                     reactions.  3) Zeolite-based magnetic resonance imaging                         contrast agents will be prepared and optimized.                                 %%%                                                                             Dr. Kenneth J. Balkus, Jr. of the University of Texas at Dallas                 is supported as a Presidential Young Investigator by the                        Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program                   to study the chemistry of zeolites and molecular sieves.  These                 materials are used in large quantities in industry as drying                    agents and as catalyst supports.  The new materials with                        encapsulated metals which will be synthesized may have                          application as catalysts in the petroleum industry and as                       magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents.",
