 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will continue investigations of solar radio                     emissions in the millimeter and centimeter wavelength domain,                   making use of the Very Large Array (VLA) of the National Radio                  Astronomy Observatory, and the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland                       Millimeter Array (BIMA) at Hat Creek.  The observed magnetic                    structure of sunspot associated microwave sources will be                       compared with model computations to determine the vertical and                  horizontal components of the magnetic field at specific locations               in the low corona.  Along with simultaneous soft X-ray                          observations, estimates will be made of the electron temperature                and emission measure and magnetic field in coronal loops.  The                  VLA microwave data along with Spacelab 2 observations of the                    transition region and coronal lines will be used to study the                   temperature and density structure of the sunspot atmosphere in                  three dimensions. Microwave imaging data will also be compared                  with hard X-ray burst data to compare the power law index of                    energetic electrons based on radio and X-ray data, to try to                    reconcile the two indices through appropriate energization                      mechanisms.  Using VLA observations of flares simultaneously                    acquired with balloon/rocket borne X-ray and UV measurements,                   flare physics including the origin of microbursts will be                       studied. Using BIMA, high spatial resolution studies of flares at               millimeter wavelengths will be conducted. In particular, the size               and spectra of millimeter burst sources, the problem of electron                and proton acceleration in gamma ray/millimeter flares and the                  anisotropy of these flares will be investigated.  The relative                  timing of mm wave vs. cm wave bursts should help distinguish                    among the possible causes of the simultaneous flare brightening                 in H, EUV, and hard X-rays. Observations of filaments at mm and                 cm wavelengths will also be made to determine the nature of                     bright lanes (at 15 GHz) spanning filaments, and to determine the               density-temperature structure of the transition sheath and                      coronal cavity.  Other proposed studies include mm active                       regions including their polarization and magnetic fields, mapping               of coronal holes and quiet regions such as supergranulation                     network boundaries at mm wavelengths, and to search for acoustic                waves in the chromosphere. ***",
