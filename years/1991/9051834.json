 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve the quality of the                       undergraduate curriculum by changing an existing undergraduate                  core course, signals and systems laboratory, into a computer-                   controlled instrument base laboratory course.  This project will                enable us to ensure that all of our graduates will have                         encountered modern CAD/CAM type equipment before their entry into               the workplace.  The contributions of the project are threefold:                 to provide state-of-the-art computer controlled instrumentation                 for each station within the laboratory: to increase the exposure                of the individual student to such instrumentation by increasing                 the number of functioning stations, thereby limiting the number                 of students per bench (maximum of two); and to create expanded                  flexibility and capabilities via PC-based laboratory stations for               utilization of CAD software for analysis and design.  Major                     equipment purchases include equipping ten complete student                      stations with personal computers and compatible programmable                    instrumentation including digital oscilloscopes, waveform                       generators, power supplies, and pen plotters.",
