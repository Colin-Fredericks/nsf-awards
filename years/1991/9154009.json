 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of evaluation has expanded quite rapidly over the                past twenty five years so that evaluation of programs is standard               practice in large organizations.  Relatively recently, school                   districts, state and federal agencies, and large organizations have             established internal evaluation staffs, procedures, and policies.               These offices of evaluation are being created in faith that they                will serve a useful function in improving science and mathematics               education.                                                                           In their infancy, agencies tend to aggressively pursue their               mission.  Later they become facilitators between the larger                     organization and the constituency regulated or observed.  Finally,              they become an arm of their constituency.  If this is the normal                development path, the evaluation agencies may not, in the long                  term, continue to pursue their mission effectively.  No one knows,              except through anecdote, what issues and policies arise, how they               are disposed of, and how internal evaluation functions.                              This study proposes to examine the development of mathematics              and science education evaluation issues, policies, and processes as             they develop over a five year period within the Directorate of                  Education and Human Resources (EHR), of the National Science                    Foundation.  By combining the results with evaluation theory, more              general perspectives on the development of evaluation within large              organizations should lead to deeper theory and understanding so                 that evaluation can serve the anticipated role in large                         organizations.  The quality of evaluations in EHR may be                        facilitated by providing feedback from the study to people in EHR               annually.",
