 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet is a powerful resource.  Interconnecting millions             of individuals at thousands of institutions worldwide, it offers                potential for significant inter-organizational sharing of                       resources, such as documents, software, data, network services, and             people. The principal investigator (PI) envisions a sophisticated               distributed collaboration paradigm where people accomplish tasks                and share resources among many interrelated individuals across                  administrative borders.                                                              The research in this project will consider three questions:                how can one design resource discovery algorithms that scale for use             in national or international networks, provide algorithms to                    support searches without imposing artificial constraints on the                 resource space organization, and build systems that require a                   minimal level of global administration agreement on protocols,                  information formats, and organizational structures.  To answer                  these questions, the PI will explore a highly decentralized                     architecture for supporting resource discovery.  The research                   emphasizes systems and networking issues, involving distribution                and replication for registering and maintaining distributed                     structures, called \"views\"; security of view contents; ease of                  creating and updating views; and ease of searching for resources.",
