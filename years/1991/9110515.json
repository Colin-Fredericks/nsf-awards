 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses the Consumer Expenditure Survey to analyze two                important problems:  the determinants of saving behavior in the                 1980's and the influence of durability and transaction costs on                 consumer choices.  The Consumer Expenditure (CEX) Survey is a                   large survey carried out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to                   collect the information used to compute the weights of the                      consumer price indexes.  Since 1980 the Survey has been conducted               on a regular basis and has the nature of a rotating panel.  The                 data set is unique in the sense that it is the only US micro data               set which has detailed and complete information on consumer                     expenditure.  This information is complemented by data on a large               number of household characteristics.  The data set, therefore,                  provides the investigator with a wealth of economic information                 which has heretofore been only partially analyzed.                                                                                                              The availability of detailed data on consumption expenditure,                   income and household characteristics permits a detailed analysis                of saving behavior.  The first aim of the project is to determine               the most likely causes of the decline in aggregate savings in the               1980s.  Particular attention will be paid to cohort and life                    cycle effects as well as to changes in the level and distribution               of income.  The quantitative significance of other factors, like                education, housing tenure decisions, family composition, etc.                   will also be considered.                                                                                                                                        The second aim of the project, the analysis of vehicle                          expenditure by US households, will be framed within a structural                model of intertemporal choice.  Two elements will be at the                     center of the analysis: the implications for intertemporal                      choices of preferences which are non-separable between durable                  services and non-durable expenditure, and of the presence of                    transaction costs in changing the stock of durables.  The                       consideration of these issues constitutes a substantial                         improvement over most of the existing literature on durable                     expenditures and, more generally, on intertemporal allocation of                consumption.",
