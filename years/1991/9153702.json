 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Carolina at Greensboro will conduct                     a three-and-one-half-year program to enhance 20 experienced                     middle school mathematics teachers in integrating calculator                    use into the mathematics classroom and curriculum.                              Participants will also design instructional materials which                     take advantage of calculators and will prepare themselves as                    leaders for communicating their new knowledge to colleagues.                    Each teacher will participate in a six-week summer session                      and 6 to 9 days of follow-up activities during each of the                      three years of the project.                                                                                                                                     Participants will earn a total of 18 graduate credits which                     may be applied toward a Master's degree in the School of                        Education.  Topics to be studied include functions and                          graphing for middle school teachers, teaching problem                           solving, probability and statistics, research in mathematics                    education, and using advanced technology to teach                               mathematics.  The project design also calls for the                             development of case histories which will evoke the effects                      of the intervention in helping teachers learn to use                            calculators in teaching mathematics.                                                                                                                            Participants will present workshops in their own school                         districts and through the Greensboro Area Mathematics and                       Science Education Center and the North Carolina Mathematics                     and Science Education Network.  In all, over 1,000 second-                      wave teachers and several parent groups should be effected                      by the project.  Cost-sharing by The University of North                        Carolina at Greensboro and local school districts accounts                      for 46% of the NSF budget.                                                                                                                                      Integrating calculators into the mathematics classroom and                      documenting the change in teacher and student behavior as a                     result of such teacher enhancement is clearly a worthwhile                      enterprise.",
