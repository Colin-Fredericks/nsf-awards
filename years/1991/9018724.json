 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the structure and dynamics of fish                assemblages in selected coral reef habitats of the eastern                      Caribbean.  It will permit explicit comparisons between patch                   reef and continuous reef habitats at one site, and among                        comparable continuous reef habitats at several sites.  Species                  composition and abundance will be determined, as well as                        temporal change in these, and (for some species) associated                     patterns of settlement and recruitment.  At selected sites,                     dynamics of assemblages will use a consistent methodology, which                has been used  previously in studies on reefs in Australia, to                  collect comparable data on Caribbean reefs over several spatial                 scales up to regional (750km), and over annual and daily temporal               scales.                                                                                                                                                         Current understanding of assemblage structure and dynamics                      emphasizes the \"open\" nature of these systems, and dynamics                     driven by, among other factors, highly variable rates of                        recruitment.  However, supporting data for this model come                      largely from a single habitat type in a few Great Barrier Reef                  sites, and its generality cannot be assumed.  This project will                 provide the information necessary for a close comparison, on                    several spatial and temporal scales, of assemblage structure and                in addition, it establishes the essential descriptive baseline                  for Caribbean assemblage structure and dynamics from which the PI               will be able to build testable process hypotheses in future work.",
