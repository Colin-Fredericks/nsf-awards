 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mississippian Stanley Shale exposed in the Ouachita Mountains               of Arkansas and Oklahoma exhibits surprising bulk chemical                      characteristics that are probably related either to metamorphic                 processes or to hydrothermal alteration.  The west to east                      increase in metamorphic grade seen in the Ouachitas is paralleled               by bulk chemical changes including depletion in Mg, Ca, Na, K,                  and Ba, and relative enrichment in Al and Li.  The increased Al                 content is reflected in an increased abundance of aluminous                     phases such as chloritoid and pyrophyllite.  The changes in bulk                chemistry suggest that the Stanley may have exported material to                surrounding terrains.  It is necessary to evaluate the processes                that may  have led to the chemical and mineralogical changes                    recorded in the Ouachitas.  To do so involves a study of the                    differences in bulk chemistry, mineralogy, and fabric that exist                between diagenetic Stanley in the western Ouachitas and                         greenschist facies Stanley in the eastern Ouachitas.  In                        particular, this research will document changes in fabric, bulk                 chemistry and isotopic tracers that may be useful in estimating                 volume loss and evaluating the extent to which the Stanley was an               open system during diagenesis/metamorphism.",
