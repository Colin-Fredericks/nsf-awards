 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study comprises four distinct areas of investigation:  (1)                 Static and dynamic light scattering on aligned nematic solutions of             a rodlike polymer, and rheological and rheo-optical studies on                  aligned and unaligned nematic solutions of the same solutions; (2)              Similar studies on the nematic phase of a thermotropic copolymer,               as a function of temperature; (3) Static and dynamic light                      scattering, and rheological studies on moderately concentrated                  solutions of polystyrene in decalin; and (4) Static and dynamic                 light scattering on dilute solutions of polymers prone to                       intermolecular association.  In the first study, the Leslie                     viscosities, the Frank curvature elasticities, and the order                    parameter will be determined over a range of chain length and                   polymer concentration.  These parameters will also be used in the               analysis of nonlinear rheological behavior in fast flow behavior.               In the second, a preliminary study will be undertaken to evaluate               the feasibility of the scattering studies to determine certain                  Leslie viscosities and Frank elasticities on a solvent-free aligned             nematic polymer.  In the third, the thermodynamics and chain                    dynamics will be studied over a range of conditions, from the Flory             Theta state to \"good solvent\" conditions.  The appearance of                    relaxation in the dynamic scattering due to chain entanglements                 will be of special interest.  Finally, in the fourth, the                       possibility that certain thermochromic effects in dilute solution               are linked to (metastable) intermolecular association will be                   investigated.                                                                                                                                                   This research aims to clarify the solution behavior of various                  types of important polymers, especially those able to form liquid               crystals.",
