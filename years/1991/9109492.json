 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an extensive statistics and econometrics literature on                 statistical tests for structural changes at an unknown time.  The               research on these tests reflect their important role in getting                 accurate, unbiased estimates of economic relationships from time                series data.  The contribution of this project comes from                       providing a better understanding of the properties of existing                  tests for structural change and from developing new tests with                  better properties.  These tests are then used to improve                        empirical studies in macroeconomics and financial economics.                                                                                                    This project analyzes the behavior of tests for structural change               in a time series context that ultimately allows for series having               a general correlation structure and possible nonstationarity,                   either of the form of a polynomial time trend or of a stochastic                nature induced by the presence of a unit root.  The components of               the investigation consist of the following: 1)  Analysis of the                 finite sample properties of current available tests for                         structural change which allow for the presence of serial                        correlation, e.g., CUSUM, Chow test, LR test, and others; 2)                    Explanation of the finite sample behavior using non-standard                    asymptotic distribution theory, e.g., continuous-time asymptotic                and small-sigma asymptotic; 3) Development of alternative                       statistical procedures that have better finite sample properties;               4)  Extensions of currently available procedures to the case                    where the time series is characterized by either a deterministic                or stochastic trend; 5) Derivation of the asymptotic                            distributions and the analysis of the finite sample properties                  for tests for structural change with trending; 6)  Empirical                    application to issues related to macroeconomic variables with                   special emphasis on testing for a change in the trend function of               a univariate time series.",
