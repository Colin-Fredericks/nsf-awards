 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support an International Conference in Stochastic               Partial Differential Equations (SPDE's), May 6-8, 1990, and a                   satellite School-Seminar in the same topic for new researchers,                 May 3-5.  Both activities will be held at the University of North               Carolina at Charlotte.  The purpose of the conference is to bring               together researchers who are working on different theoretical and               applied aspects of SPDE's and to promote research in this field.                The purpose of the School-Seminar is to bring the subject of                    SPDE's to the attention of new researchers (graduate students,                  postdocs and recent Ph.D.'s) and provide them with a unique                     opportunity to be taught by, meet, and have discussions with the                outstanding scientists working in the area.                                     The introductory sessions scheduled for the School-Seminar are                  linear elliptic and parabolic SPDE's, methods in non-linear                     SPDE's, and applications of SPDE's.  The main part of the                       conference will cover recent theoretical developments in SPDE's                 and various applications, especially to oceanography and signal                 processing.",
