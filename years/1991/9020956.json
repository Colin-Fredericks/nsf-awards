 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 20 years or so, there has been great interest in                  how children learn to read and write and the kinds of                           difficulties they face.  Although a great deal of research has                  been done on reading, writing and spelling have been somewhat                   neglected.  This research fills that gap by studying how children               learn to spell in English.  This research focuses on normal                     kindergarten and first grade children, children who are just                    beginning to learn how the English writing system works.                                                                                                        Treiman has previously studied the spellings that were produced                 by a group of first grade children in their everyday classroom                  work.  The results show that spelling is not purely a visual                    process, as is often thought.  Rather than memorizing the                       spelling of each specific word, children construct or invent                    spellings for words based on the words' sounds.  This research                  will use experimental methods, thus complementing the earlier                   naturalistic work.  In the experiments, children will be asked to               spell words containing particular sounds and to make judgments                  about the sounds in those words.  Together, the naturalistic and                experimental research can yield a better understanding of                       children's spelling than either approach could achieve alone.                                                                                                   Some experiments will study systematic spelling errors.                         Sometimes, children represent a sound with the wrong letter, as                 when they spell \"city\" as CIDY or \"boy\" as BOE.  In other cases,                children fail to spell a sound altogether.  For example, the \"s\"                sound is omitted in the spelling BET for \"best\".  In still other                cases, children use a single letter to stand for two sounds.  In                CRT for \"cart\", for example, the child uses the letter r to                     represent both of the sounds in the letter's name.                                                                                                              Other experiments will also study children's learning of English                spelling constraints.  For instance, there are certain                          constraints on the types of letter sequences that may occur in                  words.  For example, double letters may occur in the middles and                at the ends of words, as in \"banner\" and \"tall\", but rarely occur               at the beginnings of words.                                                                                                                                     Finally, still other experiments will study children's learning                 of another aspect of the English writing system.  Units of                      meaning are often spelled in a consistent manner, even when their               pronunciations change.  For example, the past tense ending is                   spelled the same way in \"jumped\", \"cleaned\", and \"floated\", but                 is pronounced differently in the three words.                                                                                                                   Together, the results should help to show why English is so hard                to spell.  The results should also help to suggest how some of                  children's difficulties in learning to spell can be overcome.                   They should even be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of                    children with severe learning problems.",
