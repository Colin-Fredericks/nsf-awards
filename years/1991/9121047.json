 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal represents the first specific task definitions and                associated funding increments under the general scope of the                    Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the National Science                      Foundation Division of Polar Programs (NSF/DPP) and the Naval                   Underwater Systems Center (NUSC), New London Laboratory, New                    London, CT.                                                                                                                                                     The purpose of the MOA is to provide a framework for NUSC to                    provide analytical and experimental investigations into the                     applicability of burst mode communications techniques via meteor                trails and ionospheric mechanisms and via high frequency (HF) radio             using state-of-the-art link management technology (automatic link               establishment, or ALE).                                                                                                                                         NUSC will utilize its resources and research into similar issues                in the Arctic to the benefit of both agencies.  The work will                   characterize the performance of the significant HF propagation                  channels used for communications in the United States Antarctic                 Program (USAP), rigorously evaluate the performance of ALE                      technology in the souther polar region over USAP channels, make                 recommendations to the USAP suitable for use in medium range                    communications planning for HF systems modernization, and                       rigorously evaluate the absolute performance of burst mode                      communications and provide a relative comparison of the performance             of competing burst mode technologies to assist the USAP in long                 range communications planning for the improvement of field party                and inter-base communications for the USAP within Antarctica.                                                                                                   The MOA outlines a broad definition of the problem areas that NUSC              will investigate for NSF/DPP, and it does not define specific tasks             or task funding levels.  The specific tasks and associated funding              are to be identified by the NSF/DPP as the need arises, and these               tasks shall be managed under the framework of the MOA.                                                                                                          This proposal represents the first explicit tasking to NUSC under               the MOA.",
