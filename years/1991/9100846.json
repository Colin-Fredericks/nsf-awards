 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to continue a 10-week summer research               experience for nine undergraduates from Carleton College and                    other regional colleges and universities.  Pre-participation                    reading requirements will provide students with an adequate                     foundation for meaningful scientific investigation.  During the                 summer, students will work in a one-to-one relationship with a                  research supervisor in the laboratory.  Weekly seminars will                    provide students with the opportunity to discuss research plans                 and results as well as to delve into primary scientific articles.               To further focus and unify the student participants, a theme of                 development regulation has been selected.  Projects will include                investigations of:  the mechanisms of action and the chemical                   characteristics of apossibly-steroid pheromone produced by                      Oedogonium, regulation of floral development in pea, structure-                 function relationships in the repressor protein of bacteriophage                P1, structure and function of the glucocorticoid receptor in rat                liver, development of synaptic connections in Xenopus, variation                of sex expression in composites, role of song communication in                  coordination of parental care in cardinals, and effect of                       gregarine parasites on population biology of capitellid                         polychaetes.  Students will present their results during a fall                 poster symposium.  Opportunities to complete research and writing               during winter break will be available.",
