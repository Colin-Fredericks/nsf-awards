 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project examines a new pressure-swing membrane permeation                   process, which can achieve separation beyond the steady state                   permselectivity of membranes possessing opposite diffusivity                    and solubility characteristics toward a gas pair.  By                           operating a membrane permeator under a cyclic pressure swing                    mode, the opposite mobility and solubility seletivities of the                  membrane can work synergistically to accomplish a degree of                     separation beyond the steady membrane permselectivity in the                    following manner.  Along the flow direction in the feed                         channel, the gas mixtures is separated chromatographically by                   the selective adsorption of gases into the membrane; and                        across the membrane, the gas mixture is separated by the                        diffusivity selectivity of the membrane.  Since all of the                      effluent streams are collected as products, the new process                     does no suffer the low productivity shortcoming of the                          previously proposed pressure swing membrane process.  The new                   process condition accentuates both the solubility and the                       diffusivity aspects of the membrane transport mechanism.  It                    is also particularly suitable for elucidating non-ideal                         membrane transport mechanisms.  The mathematical model                          developed for this new process is very effective for the                        identification of complex membrane transport mechanisms.",
