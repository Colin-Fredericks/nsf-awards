 "awd_abstract_narration": "During prostate gland organogenesis the fetal urogenital sinus                  mesenchyme induces and directs the phenotypic differentiation of                the apposing epithelium. This leads to the formation of glandular               ducts and acini, typical of the adult gland morphology. Previous                studies from Dr. Rowley's  laboratory have used organ cultures of               fetal urogenital sinus to identify potential growth and                         differentiation regulatory factors from mesenchyme. These studies               have identified a growth inhibitory factor in the conditioned                   medium from urogenital sinus organ cultures and derived                         mesenchymal cell lines. In addition, the growth inhibitory                      activity affects bladder and prostatic epithelial cell lines,                   suggesting this activity may affect cell differentiation. The                   protein responsible for activity has been purified to near                      homogeneity. The long term goals of this project are to                         understand the fundamental role of this factor, termed UGIF, in                 mesenchymal epithelial interactions during organogenesis. The                   immediate objectives of the studies proposed here are: to develop               antibody and oligonucleotide probes specific for the UGIF                       protein; to isolate and clone the cDNA encoding UGIF and; to                    determine the spatial and temporal pattern of expression of UGIF                in vivo. The proposed studies will set the foundation to                        determine the potential significance of UGIF as a regulatory                    factor in vivo, and its specific role in the basic mechanisms of                mesenchymal epithelial interactions and associated organogenesis.",
