 "awd_abstract_narration": "Governments frequently target macroeconomic variables such as                   exchange rates and interest rates through a mixed policy of                     occasional interventions affecting floating rates.  Under the                   recent managed float, for example, monetary authorities allow                   exchange rates to be determined by market forces most the time,                 only to intervene as rates deviate significantly from target                    levels.  Accordingly, it has been frequently reported in the                    financial press that occasional government intervention appears to              influence expectations on the part of private market traders who                face possible capital gains and loses from these events.  If this               is the case, asset prices should reflect expected interventions to              target rates.                                                                                                                                                   The purpose of this project is to develop a model for analyzing                 the effects of government interventions that prevent movements in               interest and exchange rates from targeted levels.  The analysis                 will show how the perceived threat of occasional capital gains or               losses induced by central bank interventions may influence market               trading.  The model will also be used to empirically evaluate the               behavior of exchange rates when intervention policies are used to               target rates.  This research is important because it will help us               better understand how policies of targeting exchange rates affect               the market's perception of these policies and how these                         perceptions, in turn, affect rates.",
