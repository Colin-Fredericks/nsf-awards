 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuritogenesis, the growth of neural processes, is important for                neuronal communication.  In order to initiate and sustain neurite               outgrowth during embryonic development, nerve cells must receive                a series of signals secreted by surrounding glial cells in the                  form of protease inhibitors, protein splitting suppressor                       enzymes.  Studies using cultured neurons implicate the role of                  two classes of multiple protease inhibitors that act on specific                internal and external proteases.  One class of protease                         inhibitors induce neurite outgrowth and the other maintains the                 outgrowth of existing neurons once neuritogenesis has been                      initiated.  Biochemical and immunohistochemical methods will be                 employed to identify the different protease inhibitors that                     migrate into neurons.  By injecting protease inhibitors into                    neurons, Dr. Shea will be able to determine which inhibitor is                  responsible for cytoskeletal stability, the framework that                      sustains the shape of mature neurites. This investigation will                  provide additional information on the regulation of axonal                      neuritogenesis.",
