Over                                       the last three years, we have modeled                                           A1GaAs/GaAs and InGaAs/InA1AsHBTs.  Using                                       a finite difference drift-diffusion                                             equations (DDE) solver and numerical                                            small-signal a.c. analysis, terminal                                            characteristics as well as fT and fmax of                                       these devices have been simulated.  In                                          view of recent interest in strained-layer                                       semiconductors, it is natural to extend                                         our current research to the modeling of                                         HBTs involving strained layers.  Focus                                          will be placed on Si1-x Gex/Si and InxGa1-x                                     As/GaAs systems.  The basic heterojunction                                      structures to be modeled are vertical                                           devices having strained double                                                  heterojunctions with either emitter-top or                                      collector-top configurations.  The Monte                                        Carlo method will be used to determine                                          fundamental material properties, e.g.                                           mobility, different coupling constants                                          needed for proper modeling of non-                                              stationary effects such as overshoot, and                                       to perform full regional analysis of                                            selected regions where these effects are                                        suspected to be taking place, e.g. in the                                       base-collector region of an HBT.  In the                                        next step, calculations will be performed                                       using hydrodynamic equations obtained from                                      the first three moments of the Boltzmann                                        transport equation with the transport                                           coefficients derived form the MC data.                                          The results of these calculations will                                          enable us to calculate both steady state                                        d.c. and small-signal a.c. parameters,                                          ranging from current gain to fT and fmax.                                       Simulation results will be compared with                                        either published data or with actual                                            device measurements to be carried out in                                        collaboration with researchers of the IBM                                       Corporation.  It is hoped that this                                             research will bring heterojunctions                                             advantages to today's well developed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            silicon technology and also take GaAs                                           technology one step further in the race                                         for the fastest semiconductor device.",
