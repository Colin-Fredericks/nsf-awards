 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northeast Louisiana University seeks funds for a three-year                     program to upgrade secondary computer science teachers'                         understanding of fundamental computer science topics and of                     current research in the field.   Two groups of twenty-five                      teachers will be trained to be teacher-leaders throughout                       the state of Louisiana.  The method of delivery will be                         different for the two groups.  The first group will attend                      three-week summer institutes during the first two summers of                    the project followed by nine days of instruction during the                     third year. The second group will attend ten weekend                            sessions during each of the second and third year of the                        project.  These alternate delivery mechanisms are designed                      to meet the needs of the teachers. Teachers will be enhanced                    in such topics as object-oriented programming, algorithm                        design and analysis, computer architecture,                                     telecommunications, and parallel processing.  Five master                       teachers will assist participants in improving pedagogical                      and classroom management skills, in methods of recruiting                       females and minority students to take computer science                          courses, and in designing computer science curriculum for                       the schools.  Project Directors will write professional                         development materials in the form of in-service training                        modules for presentation to school officials and for the                        first-wave teachers to use in enhancing second-wave                             teachers.  Follow-up activities for first-wave teachers will                    include weekly communication by e-mail and by tele-                             conferencing, a mentoring program with the master teachers,                     and site visits from the project directors.                                                                                                                     In addition to the fifty first-wave teachers, it is                             anticipated that an additional 250 second-wave computer                         science teachers will be enhanced.  Northeast Louisiana                         University's cost-sharing will account for 37% of the NSF                       budget.",
