 "awd_abstract_narration": "The separation of gas mixtures is a problem of great                            industrial significance.  Recent advances in polymeric                          technology have led to an increasingly greater use of                           membranes for these separations.  Different polymeric                           materials are commonly evaluated for a given separation by                                                                                                      measuring gas sorption isotherms and diffusion coefficients.                                                                                                    Frequently, the sorption data obtained is interpreted using                                                                                                     the dual mode model.  While this model has proved useful in                                                                                                     practice, it is largely empirical in nature and does not                        directly relate sorption properties to other material                           properties.                                                                                                                                                     This project is an investigation of the sorption of gases in                                                                                                    glassy polymers from a thermodynamic point of view.  A                          theoretical framework for the thermodynamics of gas sorption                                                                                                    in glassy polymers will be established.  Heats of sorption                      will be measured experimentally and used to validate the                        theoretical results.  Preliminary results suggest a                             relationship between sorption, mechanical properties, and the                                                                                                   heat of mixing which might aid in the screening of materials                                                                                                    for gas separation.  A comparison of the results to the dual                                                                                                    mode model allows an interpretation of certain dual mode                        parameters in terms of mechanical and thermodynamic                             properties.",
