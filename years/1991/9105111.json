 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this research is to understand the                        mechanisms that control cellular polarity during the                            eukaryotic cell cycle.  The PI used the yeast Saccharomyces                     cerevisiae as a model system to study this process because it                   displays two different aspects of cellular polarity and is a                    relatively simple eukaryote that can be easily manipulated                      both physiologically and genetically using both classical and                   molecular genetic techniques (9).  The goal of this research is to              characterize the biochemical functions of the S.cerevisiae CDC42                (CDC42Sc) gene product, a putative GTP-binding protein.  The PI                 will purify wild-type and mutant Cdc42Sc proteins and investigate               (i) their capability to bind and hydrolyze GTP and (ii) their                   potential phosphorylation states.  He will also isolate and                     characterize new proteins that interact with the Cdc42Sc protein.               The existence of a human homolog of CDC42Sc, which he and others                have shown to function in yeast (78,112) and to be an excellent in              vitro phosphosubstrate for the epidermal growth factor (EGF)                    receptor tyrosine kinase (44), suggests that the molecular                      mechanisms involved in the control of cellular polarity could be                conserved between yeasts and higher eukaryotes.  Correlation of                 information obtained in S. cerevisiae to that from higher                       eukaryotes could provide valuable clues to the nature and function              of low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins and to the                         intracellular signal-transduction mechanisms that control cellular              polarity.",
