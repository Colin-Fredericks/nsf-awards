About 35               participants will be invited to attend this workshop. They will be              from industry, the active community in academia and the government,             with approximately equal representation from the three segments.                     In a time period when the nation is clearly losing it's                    ability to compete with it's major trading partners, it is                      important to bring together various segments of society to jointly              address the issue.  The need for this is based on the concept that              a continued erosion of our industrial infrastructure threatens our              way of life.",
