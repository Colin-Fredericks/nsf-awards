 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will investigate students' reasoning about                quantitative variables and functions in different situations that               support understanding:  a physical device in which quantitities are             related by linear functions, a computer simulation of the device that           includes numerical information, and a computer-based \"functions machine\"        that presents only numerical information.  The research will focus on           the different ways that these models and representations present                resources for reasoning and learning about functions.  Students will be         interviewed in pairs, with parallel series of problems and questions for        the three systems.  Students who will be interviewed will include               middle-school students who have not studied algebra and high-school             students who have studied algebra for one year.  Teachers will be asked         to recommend students whose performance in mathematics is about at the          average of national norms.  In one study, students will answer questions        and solve problems with the systems with whatever additional                    representations they choose to use.  In two subsequent studies, students        will learn to construct (l) formulas and (2) graphs to represent                functional relations among quantitities in the situations.  A fourth            study, to be begun in this grant period, will combine learning of               formulas and graphs as representations of the systems.  Conclusions             about the students' reasoning and learning will be based on their               success in solving problems and answering questions, the explanations           they give of their solutions and answers, and the linguistic terms that         they use to refer to quantitative properties and relations.  Finally,           the work will focus on specific aspects of students' reasoning and              understanding that are similar and different situations, relating               differences to the different kinds of information and activity that the         situations provide.",
