 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed studies concern the mechanisms and the regulation of those         mechanisms whereby the kidneys excrete water, inorganic substances, and         organic substances.  They involve the regulation of the rate of                 production of a filtrate of the blood and the mechanisms by which               organic and inorganic substances are moved across renal tubule cells,           either from the initial filtrate back into the blood perfusing these            cells or from the blood perfusing these cells into the initial                  filtrate.  The organic substances being studied are those that exist as         positively charged molecules (primarily the exogenous nerve blocking            agent, tetraethylammonium, and the endogenous product of nicotinic acid         metabolism, N1-methylnicotinamide) and those that exist as negatively           charged molecules (primarily the exogenous compound, p-                         aminohippurate, and the endogenous end product of nitrogen metabolism,          urate).  These studies take advantage of the relatively simple kidneys          of reptiles in which the movement (or some characteristic of the                movement) of some substances across the tubule cells is more pronounced         than in mammals, and the complex kidneys of birds, which in part                resemble the kidneys of reptiles and in part resemble the kidneys of            mammals.  The experimental approach is an integrative one that                  explores function at the membrane cell, and whole organ levels.                 These studies are important for understanding the way in which the              kidneys permit animals to survive in specific environments and to adapt         to changing environments.  This understanding is particularly important         in terms of adopting strategies to insure the survival of animal                populations in the face of major changes in the earth's environment.            Such strategies may also be important to human populations.  These              studies will also provide substantial insight into the way in which the         kidneys in wild or domestic animals populations handle organic                  environmental pollutants, including many toxic compounds.  This                 understanding applies also to human kidneys, not only in terms of               normally toxic substances but also in terms of therapeutic agents that          can be toxic when present in excess.  Finally, these studies will               provide information on the way in which the kidneys eliminate urate,            an important substance in renal stone formation in humans and other             animals.                                                                                                                                                                                           //",
