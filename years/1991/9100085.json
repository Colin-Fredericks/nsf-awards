 "awd_abstract_narration": "Travelling waves are the solutions of partial differential                 equations that transport information in a fixed direction.  A                   physically observable wave must be stable to perturbations in its               profile.  The work under this grant will be aimed at the                        development of techniques for discriminating betwen stable and                  unstable waves.  In diffusive problems, there is envisioned a                   theory in which the structure of the wave determines any                        instabilities.  The analysis of such systems necessarily involves               a reduction to a simpler system, such as through a singular                     perturbation.  A new geometric approach to singular perturbations               is being developed with Kopell which is designed to solve                       stability problems in such equations as those of Hodgkin-Huxley                 for nerve impulse propagation.  Other stability problems to be                  attacked involve the subtle effects ocurring in fluid and optical               problems.  Exponential decay to waves does not happen in these                  cases and new techniques need to be developed.  The theory of                   transversality in dynamical systems will also be developed and                  aplied to problems in spin-orbit resonance and uniqueness in                    elliptic problems.                                                                   The complexity of physical systems that can be analyzed is                 confined by the mathematical techniques available.  Systems with                some simple character, such as those which are linear or an                     equation with a single unknown function, yield to well-developed                methods of analysis that are now part of the engineer's toolbox.                However, more complicated systems remain a challenge to the best                applied mathematicians and many important phenomena are missed by               the simplification to systems that can be easily analyzed.                      Future advances in science may well be driven by the mathematical               development of techniques for the analysis of such complicated                  systems.  One aspect of such a system that demands a mathematical               solution is the question of the stability of basic structures,                  under the perturbing influences suplied by the outside world.                   The work in this grant will be largely devoted to the development               of techniques for assessing the stability of such structures.  It               is hoped that at some point in the future these techniques will                 be in the engineer's toolbox.",
