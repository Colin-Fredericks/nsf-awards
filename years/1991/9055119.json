Students will be introduced to math, science and engineering                    concepts in ways that will demonstrate to them how academic                     coursework relates to the world around them, and how the practice               of science in accomplished.  The summer program includes morning                mathematics and English courses, seminars in culture and ethics,                afternoon pre-engineering projects, and a \"shadowing\" program                   whereby students will meet with mentor scientists and engineers.                                                                                                The academic-year program will include follow-up activities for                 students in schools through MESA (Mathematics, Engineering,                     Science Achievement) programs as well as a Saturday Academy at                  UC-Berkeley.                                                                                                                                                    The program will also involve parents by helping them become                    informed and actively involved in the education of their                        children.",
