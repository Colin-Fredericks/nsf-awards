 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research             project in condensed matter theory between Veljko Zlatic of the                 University of Zagreb's Institute of Physics and Philip Anderson of              Princeton University is to investigate the electronic properties of             high temperature superconductors and develop relevant theoretical               models for high Tc metals. Yugoslav involvement will include both               theoretical and experimental work.  The investigators will continue             their work on Dr. Anderson's model, begun under a prior grant, and              construct other theoretical models emphasizing crystal structure and            electron-phonon coupling.  In their experiments, the Yugoslavs will             characterize superconducting materials by measuring the                         thermodynamic, transport and spectroscopic properties of crystals.              Zlatic's work on the properties of high Tc metals will complement               Anderson's efforts to formulate a new high Tc superconducting theory            applied to metallic systems with local Coulomb interactions.                                                                                                    This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslavia Joint Board for                Scientific and Technological Cooperation and is supported through a             joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The award,                except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav             institution.  NSF's goals of advancing scientific knowledge is                  promoted through the joint efforts and complementary expertise of               the Yugoslav and U.S. scientists.",
