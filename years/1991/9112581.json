This symposium, now in its 18th year, is the biennial                    meeting of investigators in the areas of affinity chromatography                and the many fields related to it.                                                                                                                              Affinity chromatography is an exceptionally important area at the               present time, due chiefly to its significant relationship to                    recombinant DNA and related areas of biotechnology.  This meeting               allows leaders of the field to exchange information with one                    another in both formal and informal settings and, more                          importantly, permits new investigators, who have just entered                   this area, to interact with established investigators and with                  each other in formulating new and exciting lines of                             investigation.                                                                                                                                                  The results of this meeting will be published in a symposium                    issue of the Journal of Chromatography.",
