 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the strategic role that leverage plays                during the renegotiation of contracts with senior stakeholders.                 In particular, the substitution of debt for equity allows                       shareholders, defined as junior claimants with discretion over                  investment decisions, to bargain advantageously with the union.                 The notion is that equity withdrawal in combination with high                   leverage credibly alters the shareholders' ex post incentives to                invest unless the union's claim on the firm is renegotiated.                                                                                                    The first part of the project considers a model in which the firm's             profitability and investment opportunities are commonly known.  Two             types of contract renegotiation will be explored; in the first                  wages are renegotiated, and in the second both wage and debt                    contracts are renegotiated.  Preliminary results suggest that high              leverage will only be chosen in less profitable states of nature                when future investment opportunities appear promising.  The                     shareholders' ability to alter the capital structure of the firm                leads to an inefficient allocation of risk.                                                                                                                     The second part of the project involes extending the basic model                to incorporate incomplete information.  It is reasonable to suppose             that the shareholders have better information than the other                    stakeholders regarding the firm's future profitability and/or                   investment opportunities.  Debt may then signal the firm's                      profitability.  Informational asymmetries will lead to breakdowns               in negotiations, and thus an inefficiency will be generated by                  suboptimal investment decisions.                                                                                                                                This research will make a significant contribution to our                       understanding of the strategic use of debt and the capital                      structure problem.",
