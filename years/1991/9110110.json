The study will focus                                                                                                   on a model system containing two well characterized materials,                                                                                                  cadmium arachidate (CdA) and a substituted polyglutamate (PG).                                                                                                  The polyglutamate material has a demonstrated low mode loss                     when used as an optical medium, and the system is chosen to                     suggest certain characteristics of a potential organic optical                                                                                                  device.                                                                                                                                                         Interdiffusion between CdA layers separated by a PG bilayer                     barrier will be followed using neutron reflectometry (NR)                       complemented with x-ray reflectometry (XR).  Interface                          profiles before and after diffusion will be inferred by                         reconciling experimental reflectivities with simulated curves                                                                                                   calculated using an established matrix formalism.  Potential                    ambiguities in interpretation will be minimized by the                          combination of two complementary experimental probes,                           variation of contrast with deuteration, and the use of system                                                                                                   components which are well characterized.                                                                                                                        The expected results will add greatly to the meager existing                    data on interdiffusion between two-dimensional ordered layers.                  New insight into the mechanism and controlling parameters of                    interdiffusion will potentially impact the design of molecular                                                                                                  scale organic devices and the study of transport in model                       biological membranes.  Specifically it will be shown if a                       novel liquid-crystalline-like polymer acts as an effective                      diffusion barrier.",
