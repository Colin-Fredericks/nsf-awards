 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study the problem of                   coordinating the production of a seat of assemblies and of the                  components required to produce them when the component production               yields and the demand for the assemblies are random.  This problem              is one of inter-plant coordination since the components and the                 assemblies are usually produced in different plants.  The project               is motivated by a problem in semiconductor manufacturing where a                set of chips (components) is used to produce different thermo-                  conductor modules (assemblies).  The problem is formulated as a                 stochastic program.  The research effort is divided between                     approximation schemes that exploit special structures of                        decomposition procedure that solves the problems in two stages.                 An important tool is a new lower bound on the expectation of the                minimum of a set of random variables.                                                Proper plant coordination should result in higher expected                 (utility of) profit and in an increased ability to satisfy demand               for the assemblies.  Moreover, it should reduce the burden for the              plants producing components by releasing components for production              in the right mix.",
