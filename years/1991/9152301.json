 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Animal Physiology labs at Holy Cross offer a rather unique                  lab experience.  Not only do the students do a number of                        exercises typical to many such labs, but they also are heavily                  encouraged to be independent and to understand all aspects of                   experimental work: design, ethics, principles of the operation                  of equipment, the role an sources of variation, interpretation                  and written and oral presentation.  Recently, we have also                      incorporated independent projects.  However, we have been                       hampered by lack of two critical pieces of equipment: oxygen                    and carbon dioxide analyzers.  Whereas in other regards, we are                 exceptionally well equipped, the lack of ability to easily                      analyze reparatory gases greatly reduces the quality of labs                    that are central to the course (which emphasizes reparation and                 metabolism).  It severely restricts the scope of student                        projects and forces them to do less than they are capable of                    and wish to do.  To remedy this situation, we are requesting an                 oxygen analyzer to augment the one already present and three                    carbon dioxide analyzers.",
