 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Glenn Prestwich, State University of New York at Stony Brook                    and two Swedish researchers from the University of Lund,                        Sweden:  Professor Christer Lofstedt of the  Ecological                         Center and Professor Tommy Liljefors of the Chemical Center.                    The objective of the proposed project is to investigate                         mechanisms of pheromone detection.                                                                                                                              Chemists and biologists have developed considerable sophisti-                   cation in the elucidation of pheromone structures, industrial-                  scale pheromone synthesis, and in the use of pheromones for                     mating disruption and integrated pest management, since the                     publication of the first pheromone structure over thirty                        years ago.  In contrast, current understanding of how                           pheromones work on a molecular level is still very rudimentary.                 Dr. Prestwich and his Swedish colleagues have worked together                   over the past few years on the chemistry, biochemistry,                         ecology, behavior and sensory physiology of pheromone                           perception in the turnip moth Agrotis segetum.  Using                           pheromones prepared at Stony Brook, the investigators now                       propose to conduct:  1) biochemical studies of pheromone                        receptor and binding proteins, 2) computer simulations and                      electrophysiological evaluations of pheromone analogs, and 3)                   behavioral testing of physiologically active analogs.                           Dr. Prestwich will use molecular graphics programs at the                       University of Lund to evaluate conformations of pheromone                       analogs synthesized at Stony Brook, and will also use the                       routinely available supply of Agrotis segetum pupae and adult                   moths at Lund for biochemical experiments requiring live,                       staged insects. In addition, he will establish as routine a                     variety of biochemical techniques in the Lund laboratories                      and provide new structures for calculations and model testing                   by the Swedish groups.  This research will benefit from the                     complementary expertise of Dr. Prestwich and his Swedish                        collaborators in the chemistry of pheromone structure.  The                     results of this research will have important applications for                   future uses of pheromone technology, such as pest management.",
