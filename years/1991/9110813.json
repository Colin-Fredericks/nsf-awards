 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased intelligence and flexibility in a distributed database                system are achieved in this project using new automated reasoning               algorithms.  In particular, concurrency control is done by                      logical analysis of updates and queries to determine whether they               conflict.  The specific focus of the project is the design and                  implementation of a new database system that is fully distributed               in the sense that neither concurrency control nor any other                     function are necessarily performed at a central site.  Fully                    distributed concurrency control is achieved by explicit agreement               between sites as to which transactions may proceed, which should                be delayed, and which should be restarted.  Explicit common                     knowledge of active transactions allows the system to adapt                     heuristically to changing patterns of access to the shared                      database.  This explicit common knowledge is achieved by                        syntactic and semantic reasoning about queries and updates at                   individual sites which then execute a distributed consensus                     algorithm to share their conclusions.  OPTIONAL:  The algorithms                for reasoning about query and update conflict are based on a                    comprehensive theory of query and update independence developed                 recently by the principal investigator.",
