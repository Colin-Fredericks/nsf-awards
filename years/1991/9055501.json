The program will have                      elementary, middle school, and secondary school components,                     and includes a four-week summer institute as well as academic                   year activity. Participants from the Houston Independent                        School District will attend in three-person teams (two                          teachers, one administrator) from their schools. Each summer,                   a new group of 48 teachers will be involved, 16 at each level.                  Teachers will study mathematics content and pedagogy, with                      emphasis on patterns and functions, geometric ideas, modeling,                  statistics, and algebra.A school-based coordinator will assist                  teachers with academic-year inservice and implementation                        activities.                                                                                                                                                     Cost sharing is provided as 45% of the total award, from the                    private sector, Rice, and the Houston Independent School                        District.",
