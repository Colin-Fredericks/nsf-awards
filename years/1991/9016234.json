 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Drs.                     I.M. Navon and James O'Brien, Florida State University, and                     two French researchers: Professor F.X. LeDimet, Department of                   Mathematics, Blaise-Pascal University, Clermont-Ferrand, and                    Professor Olivier Talagrand, Laboratory for Dynamic Meteoro-                    logy, Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris.  The objective of the                    project is to investigate optimal control variational methods                   for data assimilation in meteorology and oceanography with                      the aim of improving accuracy and predictability of atmospheric                 and oceanic models.                                                                                                                                             In global forecasting models, errors arise in the numerical                     forecast mainly due to errors in the initial conditions and                     deficiencies in the dynamics and physics of the models.                         Potential improvements in numerical weather prediction (NWP)                    in the near future are expected to occur as a result of                         either better physical parameterizations or from data                           improvement in the accuracy of global observing systems. The                    use of adjoint models as an application of the theory of                        optimal control for data assimilation has seen a vigorous                       development in the last few years.  The US and French                           investigators in past collaboration have developed the                          adjoint of the NMC spectral model. In this project, they will                   focus on related theoretical questions in the area of                           optimization of algorithms, efficiency and scaling of complex                   problems. In addition, they will study the inclusion in the                     adjoint NWP of variational data assimilation of physical                        atmospheric processors, such as radiation and moisture ther-                    modynamics. This project will benefit from the complementary                    expertise of the investigators in optimal control theory and                    meteorology.  The results of this research will be important                    for enhancing the medium-range numerical weather forecasting                    model's predictability and for taking advantage of various                      satellite data which will shortly become available.",
