 "awd_abstract_narration": "A tropical cyclone may be considered to be a heat engine.                  Its fuel is the latent heat gathered by surface air  as it is                   swept toward the central region of a low-level inflow circ-                     ulation. The heat is released by condensation during ascent of                  the moist surface air in the eye-wall. In any heat engine, a heat               sink is required for energy to be converted to the kinetic energy               of motion. In a tropical storm, such a sink is found in an ele-                 vated (upper troposphere-lower statosphere) layer of outflow                    from the storm's central region. The temperature, pressure,                     humidity, and three-dimensional velocity of the  air change                     drastically before reaching this sink region. However, two other                properties are better conserved, that can serve as tracers. These               are its equivalent potential temperature (a measure of its                      entropy) and its potential vorticity (a combined measure of its                 thermal stability and rotational motion). Calculation of natural                three-dimensional fields of these properties requires, however,                 measurements of unprecedented detail and extent through the life-               cycle of a (preferably intense) tropical cyclone.                                    Four observational experiments in the summer of 1990 should                provide the data needed to analyze, in particular, the vertical                 structure of the elevated outflow layer. These analyses should                  further our understanding of tropical cyclone outflow and its                   interaction with its tropospheric and stratospheric environment.                An ideal case is now available for analysis, since the instru-                  mental networks were deployed in a region (the western Pacific)                 and during a period (10-20 September 1990) that allowed them to                 capture Super-typhoon Flo.                                                           The analyses could serve to discriminate between a few cur-                rent theories of tropical cyclone development and provide a                     basis for advancing beyond current statistical-empirical methods                for forecasting intensity changes. Also, it is estimated that 5-                10% of the global mass exchange between troposphere and strato-                 sphere occurs in these storms. Thus, the analyses could help                    refine our present estimates of atmospheric chemical budgets.                        Merrill has established a creditable past record in tropical               cyclone analyses. He is being supported by ONR and AFGL to par-                 ticipate in the data editing, reduction and statistical cyclone-                track analyses of the summer 1990 measurements. The additional                  research supported under this award provides an opportunity for                 complementary use of these unprecedented data sets.",
