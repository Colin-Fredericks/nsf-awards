 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Natural Sciences                 at Avila College to establish an REU site which will provide 10                 undergraduates with research experiences in tropical studies.                   Participants will learn and develop skills by interacting with                  faculty as they work on projects dealing with herpetological                    communities on Hispaniola.  To foster student development, a 3-                 phase program is planned:  orientation, introducing students to                 research methodology and ecological studies in the West Indies;                 apprenticeship, to develop skills; and individual research,                     resulting in publication-quality reports.  Seminars on research                 and graduate studies are included to facilitate applications of                 acquired knowledge and skills to participants' future academic                  pursuits.  Presentations will be made by scientists in both the                 United States and Dominican Republic.  Evaluation will be by                    participants, their academic advisors, and two outside faculty.                                                                                                 This program is designed to induce participants to favorably                    consider graduate studies and increase the likelihood of them                   choosing careers in science.  The faculty will \"coach\" students,                instilling a vision of research by explaining the rules and                     delivering a feeling of the \"game's\" excitement.                                                                                                                A focus on lizard communities provides opportunities to apply                   theories and methods used in ecological research while working                  with organisms that are abundant, accessible, and remarkably well               and visibly adapted to their environment.  Investigations may                   address aspects of niche dimensions, parasite infections, or                    competitive exclusion by alien species.  Students may choose                    projects within these topics or develop investigations of their                 own, including, but not limited to, physiological or ethological                studies of alien or endemic taxa.",
