 "awd_abstract_narration": "In singularity theory, topological methods have come to play               an important role, both in the classification of singularities,                 as well as in determining the properties of mappings.  In turn,                 these topological properties can be used to answer fundamental                  questions about nonlinear problems.  Professor Damon has been                   developing topological analogues of the infinitesimal methods of                Mather for answering questions about the topological                            classification of singularities.  He has also discovered that the               methods used for these results are closely related to quite                     different questions concerning the topology of discriminants and                symmetry breaking problems in bifurcation theory.  He hopes to                  develop further results for topological equivalence questions, to               use recent developments to explore topology of discriminants and                symmetry breaking for compact Lie groups, and to investigate the                application of classification results for singularities of                      solutions of differential equations.                                                 Singularity theory has obvious relevance to other areas.                   Some of the most interesting solutions to systems of equations,                 both ordinary and differential, are the singular ones.  In                      applications, it is often impossible to confine attention to the                regular solutions to problems, and knowledge about the nature of                singularities and about symmetry breaking is fraught with                       physical significance.",
