 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turbulent, nonpremixed combustion is to be modeled using a                      combination of direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large                      eddy simulation (LES) approaches.  The numerics will employ                     spectral collocation (Fourier transforms) and spectral element                  (Chebyshev transforms and P-type finite elements) techniques.                   The following physical issues will be investigated through                      DNS:  flame tip dynamics near extinguishment, lifted flame                      structure and the validation of percolation theory applied to                   flame sheet \"holes\", and the coupling between the                               instantaneous values of a conserved scalar and its rate of                      dissipation in spatially developing turbulent flames.  The LES                  work will be aimed at developing a subgrid turbulence closure                   using a scalar single-point probability density function, with                  application to a homogeneous turbulent flow undergoing a                        finite rate binary reaction.                                                                                                                                    The main objects of this research are the effects of                            exothermic reactions on turbulence, application of the                          spectral-element method to compressible reacting turbulent                      flows, and application of LES to finite rate reacting                           turbulent flows.  The results should identify shortcomings                      associated with some of the turbulence models presently in use                  and guide the way to improved techniques for closure, thus                      advancing our ability to reliably model more physically                         realistic combustion chamber flows.",
