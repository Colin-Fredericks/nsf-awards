 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Illinois, Chicago seeks funding for                      athree year program:  A Model for the Mathematics                               Preparation of Elementary School Teachers.  The  PI                             proposes to restructure the sequence of required                                mathematics courses for elementary school preservice                            teachers in order to develop mathematical thinking through                      problem solving situations on a variety of topics which                         make connections to other disciplines.  The courses will be                     designed to develop positive belief systems about the                           nature of mathematic and the process of learning and                            teaching mathematics.  A major component of the course are                      school-based experiences in multicultural settings with                         master teachers who have studied mathematics through                            inservice programs with the PI.  The schools in the project                     are  heavily populated with minorities, primarily Blacks                        and Hispanics.  Students will observe in the schools and                        analyze in the college classroom video recordings of school                     mathematics classes.  Teachers will help to develop the                         program, in particular the problem solving episodes, and                        they will serve on the project's advisory board.                                                                                                                     The project will also serve the needs of preservice                        teachers who have deficient mathematics backgrounds and                         would have to take remedial courses before entering the                         elementary mathematics course sequence.  Instead, these                         students will be allowed to take the new courses and will                       be given additional help which will enhance their                               mathematical skills and attitudes.  Since at least 50% of                       the preservice students in the remedial track are minority                      students, the program will address the issue of equal                           access for all.  The project staff will also work with the                      new teachers throughout their first year of teaching, with                      weekly support meetings in which they will receive                              additional preparation.  The materials developed                                for the project will be three distinct sets:  a problem set                     with discussions and explanations for the preservice                            teachers;  a similar set for the inservice teacher with                         additional pedagogical insights and assessments components                      as well as problems for children; and a complete set of                         materials for college instructors with references to                            mathematics education research.  Initially, the materials                       will be disseminated at cost through NCTM and the                               University. Eventually, a publisher will make materials                         available commercially.                                                                                                                                              The University of Illinois, Chicago is providing a                         cost-share amount which is equal to 25% of the NSF cost.
