The                  purpose of the symposium is to bring together an international                  group of both established and young investigators in order to 1)                highlight the advances made in understanding bimodally breathing                organisms both as the extant link in the evolutionary process by                which animals invaded the terrestrial habitat and as unique model               systems for elucidating basic physiological and biochemical                     mechanisms of adaptation, 2) define the important areas for future              research, and 3) to promote interdisciplinary and international                 collaboration in future research efforts.  The topics to be covered             in the program are interdisciplinary by design:  including                      physical, evolutionary, ecological, morphological, developmental,               physiological, and biochemical factors that affect bimodally                    breathing organisms.  The speakers represent an international                   assemblage of both established and emerging investigators within                the various fields of study concerning bimodal breathing.  A wide               range of taxonomic groups will be featured in the presentations,                bringing together an array of different organisms under a single                theme and underscoring the prevelance and importance of                         biodiversity in this field of study.  Proceedings of the symposium              will be published in the American Zoologist, and it will comprise               the first and only reference to treat bimodal breathing as a                    complex, integrated process.//",
