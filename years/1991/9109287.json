 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop algorithms that will                enable intelligent imaging add vision systems to operate robustly               and rapidly with very noisy sensor data.  Current methods perform               poorly in this regime due to a lack of well-defined optimality                  properties, `brittleness' of the underlying  discrete                           representations, and a deluge of processing inconsistencies and                 noise artifacts.  The improved performance is achieved by a                     cooperative solution of low-level signal processing and high-                   level object recognition tasks subject to numeric and symbolic                  constraints, instead of the classical sequential processing                     method.  The overall approach is Bayesian, and is formulated as                 the minimization of an energy surface.  All the image-processing                operations result automatically as by products of a gradient-                   based optimization process.  This includes the synergistic                      interaction of low and high-level variables, satisfaction of                    pattern constraints, and feedback of high-level modelling                       information.  From an architectural standpoint, the proposed                    method offers a valuable uniform strategy for parallel                          computation, which is duly exploited.  This work is expected to                 fundamentally impact applications that are required to operate                  with noisy sensor data in a limited time frame.  Encouraging                    preliminary results have been computed on a DAP massively-                      parallel processor.",
