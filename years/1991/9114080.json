 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the principal investigator's                        experimentation with algorithmic methods for the design of complex              processes that are difficult to operate and control; that is,                   processes that are often overdesigned because process engineers are             reluctant to design near or within regimes of complex operation,                where these processes are often economically optimal.  To achieve               better designs, work will continue to investigate development of                design methodologies that involve the coordination of design,                   operations, and control optimizations.  The prototype software                  system, PRODOC, will be extended to permit experimentation with new             methodologies for eliminating overdesign in a broader class of                  chemical processes.  In these new methodologies, models for design              and control are refined in a coordinated fashion as the design                  evolves.  A Model Predictive Controller (MPC) developed previously,             enables the improved control needed to operate near or within                   complex nonlinear regimes.  MPC optimization is coordinated with                economic optimization to efficiently evaluate the controllability               of the most promising designs as the economic optimization                      proceeds.                                                                            The project is concerned with two typical chemical processes               for experimentation with the new algorithms and design                          methodologies.  It extends and perfects the optimization                        techniques for locating all solutions, including the global                     optimum, of complex nonlinear programs, such as arise when                      implementing the new design methodologies.  The contributions,                  which can be expected to advance the state-of-the-art for all                   design engineers, are beginning to have an impact on chemical                   process engineers, who are gaining the ability to reliably design               more highly-integrated chemical processes that are more energy-                 efficient and profitable.",
