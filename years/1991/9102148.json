The program's awards provide opportunities for                     joint research, and the use of unique or complementary                          facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                       This award for a proposal sponsored by Dr. John C. Proakis                      of Northeastern University will support a twelve-month                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Hamid Krim at the                            Laboratoire des Signaux & Syst\u001ames, Ecole Sup\u001arieure                            d'Electricit\u001a, Yvette, France.  Dr. Krim will study                             estimation/detection with emphasis on array-processing                          problems.  In subspace-based parameter estimation and                           detection techniques, in a turbulent dispersive medium,                         applications of high resolution methods for detecting                           transmitted signals (or estimating signal parameters) prove                     difficult.  Dr. Krim recently proposed a data-based algorithm                   to estimate the direction of arrival of correlated (coherent)                   signals impinging on a linear array and has developed a                         generalized performance analysis specialized to this                            algorithm.  He will extend this work thus: (1) To account                       for the nonstationarity of the transmitting medium (e.g.,                       seasonal turbulence of the atmosphere) and accommodate for                      it, he proposes to derive an adaptive scheme that can be                        easily integrated into his current algorithm; (2) He will use                   some insightful results of a recent performance analysis to                     formally derive analytical bounds on the probability of                         resolving two closely spaced signals impinging on a linear                      array antenna.  The stronger result of an exact probability                     will also be derived after some additional reasonable                           assumptions.  This research should be of relevance to many                      applications including radar and sonar.                                                                                                                         The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel, dependent's allowance, and a flat administrative                        allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
