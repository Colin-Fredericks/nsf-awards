 "awd_abstract_narration": "Very recent advances in computer technology provide the power of                mainframe systems in relatively compact and inexpensive personal                computers.  Over the next decade this tremendous computing power                will become available in high schools throughout the country.  We               propose to harness this new technological resource as a teaching                tool for specific topics in math and science, focusing on random                processes in nature and their deep connection to concepts in                    probability and fractal geometry.  Such natural phenomena as the                growth of snowflakes via random aggregation and the disordered                  geometric configurations of polymer chains demonstrate that                     fundamentally random microscopic processes can give rise to                     predictable macroscopic behaviors.  They also give rise to random               fractal structures of inherent interest and great beauty.                       Because it is impossible to view the underlying processes                       directly computer simulation and visualization is an                            indispensable tool for understanding and studying these                         phenomena.  In the process of \"doing science\" with both hands-on                experiments and computer simulations, students will learn                       abstract mathematical concepts in a context which is at once                    concrete and inherently motivating.  Furthermore, the techniques                they will employ will mirror in most respects those in current                  use by researchers, thus forging an unprecedented link between                  this curriculum and the professional worlds of science and                      mathematics.",
