 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research tests three hypotheses relating                         decertification to changes in the fractal nature of soil                        properties and to soil food webs in big sagebrush/bluebunch                     wheatgrass communities in central Oregon which are grazed and                   being invaded by Juniperus occidentalis subsp. occidentalis.                    The hypotheses will be tested by sampling soils in two sites,                   with and without J. occidentalis, according to a fractal                        sampling design; analyzing samples for organic carbon, total                    nitrogen, moisture content, pH, soil fauna, and nitrogen                        mineralization rates; calculating the fractal dimension of the                  data by fitting straight lines to log-log semivariograms; and                   comparing the shapes of the semivariograms and their fractal                    dimensions between the sites.  The research is significant                      because it tests a hypothesis developed in deserts of the                       southwest U.S. stating that decertification may occur as                        invasion of wood plants in grassland ecosystems as the result                   of grazing, which increases the spatial heterogeneity of soil                   water and nutrients, but recognizes the fractal nature of soil                  spatial variation, i.e. that they have self-affinity and detail                 as a wide range of spatial scales, and attempts to relate the                   patterns of variation to the structure of soil food webs.                         The results of this research will contribute to understanding                 of geographical and ecological processes affecting the long                     term use of semi-arid ecosystems.  The project furthers VPW                     program objectives to provide opportunities for women to                        advance their careers in science or engineering through                         research, and to encourage other women to pursue careers in                     these areas through the investigators' enhanced visibility as                   role models on the host campuses.  In this project, the                         proposed activities which contribute to the second objective                    include:  teaching a course entitled, \"Soil spatial Variability                 and Forest Ecology;\" leading reading and discussion groups;                     advising; and organizing a series of guest seminars to be                       presented by women scientists working in fields related to the                  subject of soil spatial variability and forest ecology.",
