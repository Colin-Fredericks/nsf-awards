 "awd_abstract_narration": "For materials at high temperature, the emitted spectrum of                      electro-magnetic radiation is the most convenient non-                          intrusive probe of temperature, if the spectral emittance of                    the material is known, and if the emitted radiation can be                      distinguished from extraneous radiation which is reflected or                   scattered.  The Phase I program demonstrated that many of the                   problems of in-situ temperature and emissivity measurement                      could be overcome by a technique which modulates the                            temperature of the hot surface of interest at the point at                      which the emitted spectrum of electromagnetic radiation is                      being monitored.  By modulating the temperature, it is                          possible to distinguish emitted from reflected radiation.                       Routine calculations involving the observed spectrum of                         modulated radiation can then be applied to determine both the                   temperature and emissivity.  Phase I demonstrated the                           measurement of temperatures to within \u001a 1 K for surfaces of                     known emissivity and temperatures to within \u001a 15 K and                          emissivity to within \u001a7% for surfaces with unknown                              emissivities.  For this Phase II project, we will complete the                  research which will allow us to design, build, test, calibrate                  and field test a research prototype system based on an FT-IR                    spectrometer and a CO2 laser to modulation the frequency.  We                   will improve upon the Phase I apparatus by:  1) decreasing the                  measurement uncertainty by modulating the temperature in                        sequence with the FT-IR spectrometer to eliminate problems of                   long term drift;  2) reduce measurement noise by using a more                   sensitive detector;  3) extend the high frequency limit to                      accommodate higher temperature surfaces; and 4) make the                        system user friendly and automated.  The target specifications                  for the system will be as follows:  temperature measurements                    for surfaces of known emissivity to within \u001a 0.25\u001aC;                            temperature measurements for surfaces of unknown emissivity to                  within \u001a 5\u001aC; and emissivity measurements for surfaces of                       unknown emissivity to within \u001a 2%.  The system will be field                    tested in a coal combustion pilot plant.",
