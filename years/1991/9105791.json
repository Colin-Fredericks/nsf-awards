 "awd_abstract_narration": "An extraordinary arrangement between the Canadian Fish and Marine               Mammal Management Office, Churchill native Canadian hunters, the                Naval Ocean Systems Center, and the University of Rochester                     Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy has permitted this                       laboratory to obtain fresh specimens of tissue from Beluga whales               taken during a sanctioned hunt.  These arrangements provide the                 continuing opportunity to collect sufficient numbers of specimens               to carry out a comprehensive study of the organization and                      compartmentation of the immune system, and relationships between                autonomic noradrenergic nerves and specific cells of these organs.               The specific focus of the present proposal is investigation of                 neural-immune relationships in the Beluga whale.  The first                     Churchill field collection trip resulted in the development of                  protocols for optimum preservation of antigens and tissue                       morphology for immunocytochemical studies of the innervation of                 specific lymphoid compartments in secondary lymphoid organs of the              Beluga whale at the light and electron microscope levels.                       Preliminary findings in the Beluga spleen have revealed a                       compartmentation of white pulp and red pulp, with distribution of               lymphocytes in a periarteriolar lymphatic sheath and follicles                  similar to rodents and primates.  Immunocytochemical staining for               tyrosine hydroxylase-positive noradrenergic nerve fibers and                    neuropeptide-Y (NPY) nerve fibers showed abundant innervation of                the white pulp, including both the vasculature and some areas of                parenchymal cells.  This close association between nerve fibers and             lymphoid cells was further substantiated at the electron microscope             level with tyrosine hydroxylase and NPY-positive nerve terminals                forming synaptic-like contacts with lymphocytes and macrophages.                These studies will be continued by investigating the extent to                  which these contacts fulfill the criteria for neurotransmission.                Norepinephrine and its metabolites will be measured in freshly                  frozen tissue using high performance liquid chromatography with                 electrochemical detection (LCEC).  Dissociated lymphocytes from the             spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes will be used in assays for                      expression of adrenoceptors, particularly the beta 2 subset.                    Dissociated cells will also be placed in culture for studies of the             effects of norepinephrine and NPY on functional assays to study a               possible role for neural-immune interaction in the Beluga spleen.                                                                                               This project will take advantage of an extraordinary opportunity,               to obtain tissues from Beluga whales killed by native Canadian                  hunters in officially sanctioned hunts, to study the organization               of the immune system and interactions of the nervous system with                the immune system in these marine mammals.  A better understanding              of the regulation of immune function by the nervous system is                   increasingly regarded as important to the understanding of the                  effects of stress on survival of all vertebrate animals.   This                 unique opportunity represents the opening of a new area of basic                research that should lead to a better understanding of the                      physiological mechanisms underlying effects of the environment on               the survival of marine mammals.***",
