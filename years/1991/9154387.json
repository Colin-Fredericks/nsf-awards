 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Academy for Math and Science Teachers in Chicago is                         part of a school reform movement which has given parents                        and community members more power and a greater stake in                         their schools.  The Academy provides the resources in math                      and science teaching, bringing new knowledge, expertise,                        teaching methodologies, a collegial environment and even                        prestige to teachers participating in the academy programs.                     This first year of a long range project involves 12                             participating elementary schools, 12 teachers per school                        for a total of 144 teachers, half of whom will come from                        K-3 grade levels and the rest from grades 4-8. The vision                       of the Academy founders is that it eventually provide                           inservice for all teachers in the city of Chicago.                                                                                                              For this first year, the teachers will be involved in                           Academy courses during the school year on a schedule of two                     days every other week for a period of 16 weeks for a total                      of 120 contact hours.  Academy trained teachers will                            substitute for the participating classroom teachers on an                       ongoing and regular basis.  These Academy teachers will                         also act as liaisons between the Academy and the schools                        for purposes of providing resources and expertise to the                        schools and for implementing a network among the teachers                       and schools.  Two week summer sessions, held both at the                        Academy and at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory                        (Fermilab), will further involve the teachers in the                            curriculum improvement and instructional methodology                            necessary for implementation of a more comprehensive                            science and mathematics program in the schools.  Curricula                      materials used both in the school year courses and the                          summer sessions include mathematics and science programs                        previously funded by NSF, such as MathTools, TIMS, CEPUP                        and other material.                                                                                                                                             An extensive follow-up segment as well as an assessment and                     evaluation of the program is planned.  The evaluation will                      contain two components: a) a program evaluation of the                          follow-up segment and b) an overall formative report on the                     effectiveness of the total Academy program in meeting its                       mission and goals.                                                                                                                                              Excellent cost-sharing is provided through grants from the                      Department of Energy, the Department of Education, the                          Amoco Foundation, the City of Chicago, the State of                             Illinois, other private foundations and federal agencies.",
