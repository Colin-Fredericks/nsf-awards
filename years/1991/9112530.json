 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Billups                     will expand the recently developed vacuum gas solid reaction                    technique (VGSR) to the synthesis of highly unstable compounds                  under conditions where structural studies can be performed.                     Particular emphasis will be placed upon the use of solid                        alkalai fluoride to effect the elimination of beta-halosilanes                  to yield highly strained intermediates. In addition,                            bifunctional cycloproparenes will be polymerized with silver                    ion to produce a series of new aromatic materials. Finally, the                 organic and organometallic chemistry of C-60                                    \"Buckminsterfullerene\" will be studied.                                         %%%                                                                             A major focus of Dr. Billups' research program in recent years                  has been the development of a vacuum gas phase procedure for                    synthesizing small ring compounds. This approach, which is                      utilized in only one other laboratory in the United States,                     allows the reactive species to be isolated at low temperature                   for subsequent chemical and structural studies. In other work,                  Dr. Billups will study some aspects of the chemistry of a new                   allotrope of carbon, \"Buckminsterfullerene\", which contains a                   cluster of sixty carbon atoms. This novel, all-carbon cluster                   is of considerable interest from a theoretical standpoint and                   also for its potential materials applications.",
