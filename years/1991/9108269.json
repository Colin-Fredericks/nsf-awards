 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves four senior research topologists                     (William Browder, Wu-chung Hsiang, John N. Mather, and William P.               Thurston), one postdoctoral associate (Lang-Fang Wu), and three                 advanced graduate students.  Their research topics are quite                    various.                                                                             Browder will study free actions of certain topological                     groups on finite-dimensional spaces.  He will also study fixed                  point theorems and regularity of minimal surfaces.                                   Hsiang will work on a number of problems related to the                    cyclotomic trace map, including the notorious Novikov conjecture                in L-theory as well as some more tractable ones.                                     Mather's research deals with area-preserving diffeomorphisms               of infinite cylinders.  There are several hard conjectures about                invariant curves under diffeomorphisms and their rotation                       numbers.                                                                             Thurston will work toward his famous geometrization                        conjecture for 3-manifolds.  In addition, he will work on                       automatic groups, self-similar tilings, one-dimensional real and                complex dynamical systems, and other topics.                                         Wu's research concerns the Ricci Flow equations on manifolds               and orbifolds.                                                                       All these topics are in the mainstream of research in                      topology.  It is appropriate to involve graduate students in                    their study.  For example, the geometrization conjecture of                     Thurston is a notoriously difficult problem.  It subsumes the                   Poincare Conjecture, which dates to the turn of the century.                    Nevertheless, pieces of it have been the stuff of numerous Ph.D                 theses by Thurston's students for more than a decade.",
