Posey's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in                         Chemistry Award in support of her research at Vanderbilt                        University. The research is concerned with the behavior of                      solvated transition metal ions in a microsolution environment.                  Investigating the details of the local microscopic forces                       between an ion and its nearest neighbors presents an                            experimental challenge because the influence of the bulk                        solvent on measurable properties often overshadows local                        effects. In this research, an electrospray ion source coupled                   with mass spectrometry will allow divalent transition metal                     cations to be isolated in a controlled solvent environment as                   gas phase clusters, which can then be probed using laser                        spectroscopy. Restriction of the local environment should                       reveal vibrationally resolved electronic absorption spectra,                    providing structural information as well as the strength of the                 metal-ligand bond and perturbation of the ligand by the strong                  field of the ion.                                                               %%%                                                                             The enhanced understanding of ion-solvent interactions will                     challenge theoreticians to develop more accurate potential                      energy surfaces and ultimately provide a foundation for                         learning how to manipulate the chemical reactivity of solvated                  ions.",
