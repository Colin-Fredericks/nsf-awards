 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a program whose aim is to enable                   geoscientists to make full use of the next generation synchrotron               radiation source currently being constructed at Argonne National                Laboratory.  The extremely great brightness, the high energies,                 and the large energy range of synchrotron radiation make it                     possible to study and analyze the chemistry, structure, and phase               relations of materials, many of which could not be analyzed                     precisely before synchrotron radiation techniques became                        available.  Geoscientists want to be able to quickly seize upon                 research opportunities that will exist when the synchrotron                     radiation source at the Argonne Laboratory becomes operational.                      This  award will be used to fund continued planning                        activities required for detailed design and development of                      beamlines and experimental stations to be used by earth                         scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory.  The award will                  also support a hands-on workshop to train a new generation of                   earth science investigators in synchrotron radiation techniques.",
