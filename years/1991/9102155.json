 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many useful thin-walled structures such as aircraft and automatic               parts, rocket casings, helicopter blades, and a variety of                      containment vessels, are constructed of layers of anisotropic,                  filament or fiber-reinforced materials.  While many of these                    structures are subject to severe mechanical, inertial, or thermal               loads, they must often be designed to remain elastic.  This means               that it is particularly important to be able to compute accurately              global characteristics, such as buckling loads and natural                      frequencies, as well as local information such as stresses near                 holes or edges.  It is proposed to study two important,                         complementary regions of such structures, namely, the interior                  where there are no steep stress gradients, and the edge zone(s)                 where stress gradients are high.  For both regions, simplified,                 cost-effective asymptotic methods will be developed.  The scope of              the investigation will include both linear and nonlinear problems.              It is known that considerations of nonlinear effects in composites              often lead to striking differences from predictions of linearized               theories.  In view of the rapid utilization of advanced composite               materials in current technology, studies on large deformations of               such materials promise to have widespread impact on the knowledge               and technology base.",
