 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative research will be conducted between Andre Wyss                (University of California, Santa Barbara) and Mark Norell                       (American Museum of Natural History, NY).                                            Isolated from other continents for nearly all of the                       Cenozoic, there developed in South America a highly peculiar and                endemic land mammal fauna that has captured the interest of                     evolutionary biologists and paleontologists for more than a                     century.  An extraordinary new fauna from the Andes of central                  Chile falls within what previously represented the most poorly                  known span of the South American Tertiary record, an                            approximately 15 million year post-Mustersan (middle Eocene),                   pre-Deseadan (?late Oligocene) interval.  As this span coincides                with a major faunal transition, it is crucial to the                            understanding of several long-standing problems of phylogenetic                 relationship among the major groups of indigenous South American                fossil mammals.  The new fauna thus marks the first well                        represented fauna clarifying the Eocene-Oligocene transition                    from the continent.                                                                  In addition to being of major paleobiologic importance, the                new fauna bears significantly on interpretation of the                          stratigraphy and tectonic history in a very broad segment of the                central Andes.                                                                       This study has three points of focus.  The first involves a                continued vigorous field collection and reconnaissance program.                 The second concerns description of this diverse, well preserved,                and highly unexpected fossil assemblage, and placement of its                   constituents into a rigorous phylogenetic framework.  The third                 consists of the discovery's placement into a highly integrated                  geochronologic context.  To that end, biochronologic,                           magnetostratigraphic, and radioisotopic methods will be employed.",
