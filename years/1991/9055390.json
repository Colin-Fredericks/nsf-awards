 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Northern Iowa seeks funds for a three-year                    program to improve the teaching of secondary school                             mathematics through implementation of the NCTM Standards and                    the use of the Addenda materials.  Forty-two Presidential                       Awardee middle and high school mathematics teachers will                        receive three weeks of intensive summer training in                             effective in-service skills and in algebraic thinking and                       its connections to various areas of mathematics.  They will                     then conduct 12-hour in- service programs in their local                        school districts during the school year. The second year                        participants will attend a two-week summer program, followed                    by their presenting one-week regional summer workshops and                      12-hour regional and state in-service programs.  The third                      year participants will attend a one-week summer program and                     will present one-week summer workshops.  Follow-up                              activities will include field-testing of materials developed                    for the workshops and regional meetings held during the                         school years. The project will include in- service packets,                     a monograph on evaluation methods, and a paper summarizing                      research on teacher change, all of which will be prepared by                    participants and staff.                                                                                                                                         In addition to the forty-two first-wave teachers, it is                         anticipated that 1680 second-wave middle and high school                        teachers will be enhanced.  The dissemination of the in-                        service packets has potential to create a third-wave of                         teacher enhancement.  The University of Northern Iowa's                         cost-sharing will account for 13% of the NSF budget.                                                                                                            This model delivery system for in-service training has high                     potential for becoming an exemplary                                             teacher-teaching-teachers model which could serve as a guide                    for other mathematics teacher enhancement programs.",
