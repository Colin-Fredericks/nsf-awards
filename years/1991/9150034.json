 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kids Network is a telecommunications-based approach to                     elementary science which has been demonstrated to be very                       effective in stimulating students' interest in science and                      technology.  In this project, the Technical Education                           Research Center and the National Geographic Society will                        develop models for introducing Kids Network into preservice                     elementary teacher education.  In the first year of the                         project five institutions--Hampton University, Penn State,                      Purdue, Swarthmore, and UC Irvine--will implement, document,                                                                                                    and evaluate methods for utilizing Kids Network in such                         courses as science methods, learning theory, educational                        technology, and practice teaching.  In the second year an                       additional ten institutions will assist with refining these                     models and demonstrating their disseminability.  The project                                                                                                    will also produce a Preservice Educator's Packet providing                      practical suggestions for using Kids Network in preservice                      curricula, and a monograph containing articles by                               participating faculty examining the models and research                         results in relation to current thinking about elementary                        science teaching.  The cost sharing will be 20% of NSF's                        contribution.",
