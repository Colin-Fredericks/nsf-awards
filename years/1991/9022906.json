Among the experiments are a                   three-dimensional sub-Doppler spectroscopy applied to the                       photodissociation of water; looking at the reaction CN + HCN                    going to CNH + CN using isotopically labeled reagents; a test                   of the inversion mechanism in the reaction of H with SiD4 or                    CD4; Rydberg atom chemistry in the Cs + H2 reaction; looking                    for spin-aligned products from Hg* + H2; and an intramolecular                  reaction in 3-fluoropropanol initiated by photodissociation of                  the OH (or OD) bond to give HF (or DF).                                         %%%                                                                             One of the goals of a chemist is to elucidate experimentally                    the elementary mechanisms of a chemical reaction as simply and                  directly as possible.  Chemists are constantly proposing new                    methods to reach this goal.  This project covers six types of                   elementary chemical reactions which will be investigated by new                 methods or which will be studied for the first time to                          illustrate a general principle.  The results of such an                         investigation will allow chemists to gain valuable insights                     into how chemical reactions occur on the atomic and molecular                   level.",
