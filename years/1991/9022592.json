To this end, UTSA will recruit and train honors minority                        undergraduate students.  The students will be strongly                          research oriented and will emphasize research opportunities                     for students with faculty supervisors.  The faculty                             participants will be asked to commit themselves to mentor                       relationships with students and to encourage them to pursue                     graduate training.                                                                The curriculum in each of the selected areas will be                          enhanced through Honors Research Seminars, Independent                          Research courses, a Distinguished Guest Lecturer series,                        off-campus summer research and special workshops which will                     become part of the required curriculum for all RCMS students.                   Each scholars with GPA>=3.0 will be selected for the program                    each year.",
