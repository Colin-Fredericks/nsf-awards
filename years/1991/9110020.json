 "awd_abstract_narration": "American and Soviet experiences with developing talent in                  young mathematicians contrast with and complement each other.                   American competitions usually emphasize speedy response to many                 short-answer questions.  Soviet competitions call for more                      carefully written longer answers to fewer problems.  American                   extra-curricular programs most frequently provide advanced training             in mathematical subject matter, taught by university staff.  Soviet             experiences outside the classroom are often led by high school                  teachers or by the students themselves, and more frequently involve             deeper exploration of problems which need no background beyond the              students' own.  American students need practice in developing                   mathematical proofs and discussions.  Because of this, they do not              compete well on Olympiad-style questions.                                            This grant will support 25 high school students and 5 high                 school teachers to travel to the Soviet Union in July, 1991, in                 order to participate in an international summer camp for high                   school students of high mathematical ability in the USSR.  It is                important for Americans to learn what has been done in the Soviet               Union, especially since in the rapidly changing Soviet society,                 some of the traditions that have produced their excellent young                 mathematicians may disappear.  A plan for permitting Americans to               learn about these traditions and borrow what can be easily                      transported is very timely.",
