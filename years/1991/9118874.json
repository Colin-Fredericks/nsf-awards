 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr.Herbert Edelsbrunner is a young computer scientist who has already           made fundamental contributions to the emerging field of computational           geometry.  The Alan T. Waterman award committee has recommended                 Dr. Edelsbrunner for this award, selecting him from among 97 nominees.          This award carries a grant of $500,000 for three years.  Dr.                    Edelsbrunner will be the sixteenth recipient of the Alan T. Waterman            award.                                                                                                                                                          Dr. Edelsbrunner is a pioneer in the field of computational geometry            which deals with the representation and manipulation of geometric               shapes and patterns.  Coping with the real-world objects requires               taking into consideration their real geometries rather than treating            them as idealized, oversimplified shapes.  Computational geometry is            thus going to be of utmost importance in computational science and              computer-aided design.                                                                                                                                          Dr. Edelsbrunner has had a tremendous impact on computational geometry          by his own research as well as by his l987 book Algorithms in                   Combinatorial Geometry which systematized the field in its early                days.  This book is considered by many people to be still the best              textbook and reference source on computational geometry.  He has also           influenced the field by being active professionally in it.  He has              organized a number of conferences and workshops on the subject.  He             has also served as editor for several journals on computational                 geometry and related subjects.                                                                                                                                  There is no question that Dr. Edelsbrunner's work is of the highest             research quality and is having far-reaching impact.  This award is              highly recommended.",
