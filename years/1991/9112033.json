 "awd_abstract_narration": "Political Scientists do not understand very well the process by                 which diverse groups are forged into effective and enduring                     political coalitions such as political parties. Although a                      variety of explanations have been advanced which variously                      emphasize the importance of the political environment, the role of              leadership, the nature of basic social and economic divisions in                society, and the nature of existing political and social                        institutions, rigorous tests of these competing explanations have               been hampered both by inadequate theory and by a lack of                        appropriate data.                                                                                                                                               This ambitious doctoral dissertation research refines and tests a               theory of party formation through comparative analyses of the                   formation of Christian Democratic parties in Italy and France                   following World War II.  Blending statistical analyses and                      intensive case studies this project will test a series of                       interrelated hypotheses linking the development of parties to the               degree of support provided by government officials, the existence               of ancillary institutions such as churches which support party                  formation, and the choices made by party leaders.                                                                                                               When completed this study will provide important insights into the              process by which democratic political parties are established and               succeed or fail.  In addition to contributing to fundamental                    knowledge about political processes the lessons learned from this               research should provide valuable guidance to he development of                  democratic political parties in the formerly authoritarian states               of eastern europe.",
