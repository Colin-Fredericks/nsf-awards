 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is a continuation of support for a REU site in the                 Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Notre Dame.                The support for 10 undergraduate students each year allows them to              become involved in the research activities of the faculty of the                Department and provides students with an improved understanding of              research and encourages them to consider careers in research.  The              research activities span the areas of expertise of the faculty in               civil engineering and includes projects in water resources,                     bioengineering and pollution control, and structural mechanics.                 Components of the program include identification of exceptional                 students through nationwide recruitment with emphasis on women and              minority participation; matching of student research interests with             faculty; close interaction of graduate students and faculty with                the undergraduates to provide students with a fuller appreciation               of graduate study, university research, and careers in academia;                an intense two month research experience; mini-courses, as needed,              to facilitate effectiveness in the research projects; and a mini-               conference for presentation of results.  The goal of the program                is to excite some of the best engineering students in the nation                about the challenges of a career in research.",
