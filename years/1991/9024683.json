 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Richard Davis, Mr. Chapurukha Kusimba,               a graduate student at Bryn Mawr, will collect archaeological data               for his doctoral dissertation.  His research will focus on the                  Swahili speaking region of the Kenya coast and he will attempt                  both to reconstruct the Iron Age prehistory of the region and to                set this into an ethnographic context.  In particular, he will                  examine the role of iron technology in culture development and                  change.  Although traditional iron working is no longer practiced               in this area, elderly men still have knowledge of the techniques.               Therefore, in the ethnographic phase of this project, Mr. Kusimba               will conduct extensive interviews.  He will also observe iron                   smelts conducted for his benefit and collect samples of raw                     materials, slag and finished products.  These, as well as similar               remains collected by archaeological excavation, will undergo                    laboratory analysis.  In a second phase of the project, he will                 conduct a regional archaeological survey and excavate at the site               of Mtwapa which is located near Mombasa.  The site consists of                  approximately twenty acres of mud brick ruins and dates to the                  Iron Age.  Data from Mtwapa will serve not only to examine                      prehistoric iron working techniques, but also to show how this                  major site developed and then declined over time.                                                                                                               The Swahili peoples are distributed along the East African coast                and they were transformed in less than a millennia from small                   scale fishing and agricultural groups into an urban, literate,                  Islamic and maritime trade oriented civilization.  While a                      central aim of archaeological research is to understand the                     development of social complexity, relatively little attention has               been devoted to this case.  Mr. Kusimba wishes to determine the                 role which technology played in this transformation.  Because                   iron was crucial to sub-Saharan peoples and because it was                      locally produced, it provides an excellent focus for Mr.                        Kusimba's study.                                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  On an empirical                level it will collect data on traditional metalworking techniques               which (given the age of remaining practitioners) would otherwise                soon be lost.  It will increase scientific knowledge of East                    African prehistory and assist in the training of an extremely                   promising young scientist",
