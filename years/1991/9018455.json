 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Zilm is supported by a grant from the Experimental                    Physical Chemistry Program to study the structure of metastable                 molecular fragments captured in a low temperature matrix using                  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques for high resolution                 studies in the solid state.  These studies should provide                       information on the nature of the intermediates formed during                    the course of a chemical reaction and thus further our                          understanding of how chemical reactions occur.                                                                                                                  A combination of the structure-specific information from                        high-resolution techniques of solid state NMR and the matrix                    isolation techniques for reactive intermediates have been                       demonstrated by Zilm as a useful tool for the transient species                 produced in a chemical reaction.  With new NMR techniques that                  he has developed he will investigate the structure of singlet                   biradicals, singlet carbenes and silylenes, singlet nitrenes,                   ynols, and other species.  Dipolar couplings and therefore                      internuclear distances and relative orientations of bonds will                  provide detailed structure, and chemical shift tensors will                     provide additional information about the electron distribution                  in these fragments.  Sensitivity of the NMR techniques will be                  increased by operating at 20 K.",
