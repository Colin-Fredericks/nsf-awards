 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the development of new approaches to                    carbon-carbon bond formation by oxidation of functionalized                     dienes using electrochemistry. Preliminary results indicate                     that five, six and seven-membered rings can be formed in high                   yield by this methodology. The studies involve the design,                      synthesis and electrochemical oxidation of a series of coupling                 substrates aimed at probing the overall requirements of the                     reaction. These experiments are designed to examine the                         coupling reactions involving the initiating and terminating                     groups that are compatible with the reaction conditions, the                    size of the rings that can be formed, the effect of                             substituents, the stereochemistry of the products, and the                      effect of the reaction conditions on product formation.                         Finally, the project examines the synthetic utility of the                      reactions for constructing polycyclic ring systems and                          initiating tandem cyclization reactions.                                                                                                                        %%%                                                                                                                                                             With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                 Division will support the research of Dr. Kevin D. Moeller of                   the Department of Chemistry at Washington University. The                       project is in the general area of synthetic methodology and                     focusses on the development of carbon-carbon bond formation by                  oxidation of functionalized dienes using electrochemical                        methods. These types of reactions are extremely important                       because they allow the development of entirely new routes for                   molecular synthesis. Oxidative organic electrochemistry is                      ideally suited for initiating the key step in these reactions                   since it can selectively generate reactive intermediates under                  neutral conditions.",
