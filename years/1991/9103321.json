 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synthetic samples of copper sulfides will be prepared                         containing controlled amounts of impurity elements in order to                  investigate the effects impurities have on the anodic                           dissolution of these materials.  Specimen composition will be                   determined before and after reaction by electron microprobe and                 x-ray diffraction.  Reacted sulfide disk electrodes will be                     sectioned normal to the exposed surface so that composition                     changes can be measured as a function of depth, applied                         potential, and reaction time.  The composition of a partially                   reacted copper sulfide is know to be a function of applied                      potential, reaction time, and sample origin, and it is                          hypothesized that there is a composition gradient with distance                 from the exposed surface and that the composition is also                       related to the impurities present.  Electrochemical techniques,                 including differential capacitance, resistivity, and cyclic                     voltammetry, will be used to characterize the electrical                        properties of the sulfides and to identify electroactive                        surface species involved in the dissolution reactions.  Peak                    height data from the cyclic voltammograms will be collected at                  intervals over an extended period and integrated in order to                    determine whether the number of electrons transferred in the                    dissolution reactions is constant over time; this quantity is                   already know to be potentially dependent.  Rotating ring disk                   electrodes with demountable sulfide disks will be used to                       measure the concentrations of soluble conducts, Cu(I) and Cu                    (II), so that the rate of formation of these species can be                     correlated with composition changes in the solid and with the                   impurities present.                                                               This research effort to examine the electrochemistry of                       semiconducting copper sulfides which contain controlled amounts                 of various impurities is of technological interest because of                   similar reactions occurring in hydrometallurgical processing,                   and is of scientific interest because little work has been                      published on the kinetics of the electrochemistry of                            semiconductors that undergo chemical-composition changes.  The                  project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigators'                        enhanced visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In                    this project, the proposed activities which contribute to the                   second objective include:  conducting a seminar course, and                     informal mentoring of undergraduate and graduate women students                 enrolled in engineering or interested in careers in the field.",
