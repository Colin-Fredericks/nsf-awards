 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to bring biological and geological              relationships into the structure of an economic model for the                   valuation and management of tropical forests.  The economic model               is grounded in theory and incorporates recent developments in the               modeling of dynamics and decision-making under uncertainty.  The                project's application to a specific planning problem will                       demonstrate the importance of this multidisciplinary approach to                the complex issues surrounding tropical deforestation and resultant             global change and loss of genetic diversity.                                                                                                                    The first part of the project will develop a theoretical model for              the management of tropical forests that address some special                    constraints and uncertainties associated with their use.                        Specifically, uncertainty, irreversibility, and spatial                         relationships modify traditional management schemes to reflect the              character of tropical management issues.  The inclusion of spatial              interactions between plots allows the model to address the                      complementary issues of minimum habitat size, reforestation, and                externalities.  The second part of the study involves an                        application of the model to a land planning case in Thailand.  Data             collected to describe the benefit flows from use options and the                types of biological interactions across plots will be inserted in               a computer algorithm that will solve the nonlinear programming                  problem for the Thai data.  The planning model will determine                   spatial and intertemporal allocation patterns among a group of land             users.",
