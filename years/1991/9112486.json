 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emulsion polymerization is widely used in industry to produce                   latices for applications such as latex paints, adhesives,                       coatings, binders in paper and textile products, synthetic                      rubber, etc.  The latex stage of the production is coagulated                   to give bulk polymer, or a final product, which after suitable                  treatment is made available in its original latex form ( for                    example, acrylic paints).  In addition, environmental concerns                  and regulations have initiated a major trend driving away from                  paint products with high solvent content leading to widespread                  use of water based latices.  The control of emulsion                            polymerization reactors is still a difficult task.  The                         problems of controlling emulsion polymerization processes are                   due to their multiphase nature which is not well understood.                    Newly emerging sensor technology combined with advances in                      modeling and process control, introduce the potential to                        better control such industrial systems and provide US                           industries with a competitive edge in emulsion polymerization.                  This grant is for equipment only a prototype process control                    facility for emulsion polymerization.  Included are a fully                     instrumented polymer reactor and automatic sensor and control                   equipment.  Various process design and experimental testing of                  different control strategies will be carried out including the                  testing of new on-line sensors.",
