 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in computer networking concerns controlling the               use of processing resources in large communication systems.  With               user demands growing in number and complexity, there is a need to               develop mechanisms for efficient resource allocation.  The focus                is on systems in which the underlying driving parameters vary with              time.  The approach addresses two shortcomings in several current               approaches to the optimization of resource control:  the                        assumptions that certain parameters are governed by known                       probability distributions, and that the driving parameters are                  stationary or constant with time.  This approach uses stochastic                optimization algorithms that execute on-line in a system in which               the driving parameters vary with time.  Convergence properties of               the algorithms using the relatively new theory of large deviations              are studied, and experiments conducted through simulation allow                 comparison of different algorithms.  It is expected that the                    results will contribute to resource control in communication                    systems as well as to an increased understanding of time-varying                stochastic systems in general.",
