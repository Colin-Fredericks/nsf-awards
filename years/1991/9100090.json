 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent public policy discussions have raised                                    concerns over the insurability of quake                                         damages and the extremely low level of                                          earthquake insurance purchase by small                                          business.  At the same time, very theoretical                                   issues have been raised about the use of                                        deterministic loss estimates, especially                                        worst-case ones, in insurance evaluation                                        procedures, especially for earthquake.  These                                   theoretical issues suggest that deterministic                                   decisions, decision made in ignorance of                                        probabilities, may encourage adverse                                            selection and discourage risk                                                   diversification, such as coverage of numerous                                   small properties with geographical spread.                                      To examine these issues, and also to clarify                                    superior risk tools now available for                                           earthquake, quantitative models for both                                        insurers and small businesses will be                                           developed and examined using these models to                                    determine whether or not and under what types                                   of program constructs earthquake insurance                                      would be feasible for post-disaster recovery                                    of small businesses.  This quantitative                                         approach should further assist in clarifying                                    the concept of insurability.",
