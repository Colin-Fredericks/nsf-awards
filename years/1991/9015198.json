 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Philip E. Brown of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and                      Dr. David Groves of the Key Centre for Strategic Mineral                        Deposits of the University of Western Australia. Most                           available data on the nature and genesis of Archean lode                        gold mineralization has been gathered on mesothermal deposits.                  Fluid compositions and the timing of mineralization are                         reasonably well agreed upon. There is however considerable                      continuing debate as to the source of the ore components and                    the fluid. The objective of this collaborative project is to                    conduct a fluid inclusion study of lode gold deposits of the                    Yilgarn Craton in western Australia. The area to be studied                     contains gold deposits hosted in amphibolite-to granulite-                      facies metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. This research                    will compare these results which are representative of lower                    crustal levels and therefore less modified, more proximal,                      ore fluids to data from the better-studied mesothermal                          deposits. Extending the range of deposits studied through                       this project will allow the development of genetic models and                   general understanding of the mechanisms of gold mineralization,                 and their relationships to late-Archean tectonics.                                                                                                              The project represents excellent U.S. and Australian                            collaboration. Dr. Brown has many years of experience in                        fluid-inclusion studies involving ore deposits and/or                           metamorphic terranes and the background in theoretical fluid                    modeling that will be necessary to interpret the pressure-                      temperature-composition history of the fluids trapped in                        inclusions in high-grade metamorphic rocks. The Australian                      research group has an excellent international reputation, and                   the documentation of mineralization in the Yilgarn Craton                       required for the study.  In addition to providing useful data                   on the fluid characteristics and conditions of mineralization,                  the research has the potential for broader application in                       interpretation of gold deposition world-wide in Archean                         terranes and in exploration models for similar gold deposits.",
