 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the participation of eight US                   scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on \"Satellite Ocean                      Color Remote Sensing.\"  Synoptic coverage of ocean color data                   from satellites has for some time been a high priority for                      the ocean sciences community.  Ocean color data is important                    both for current and future ocean science investigations and                    has particularly important applications to global change                        problems.  The first US satellite ocean color scanner (CZCS)                    was launched in 1978 and successfully produced data until the                   summer of 1986 when a technical problem with the instrument                     forced an end to the mission.  However the mission did prove                    the feasibility of using a satellite scanning radiometer to                     provide accurate estimates of near-surface scanning con-                        centrations of phytoplankton chlorophyll over large regions                     of the global ocean.  The next US ocean color scanner                           (Sea-WiFS) is due to be launched in 1994 and a similar                          scanner (OCTS) is scheduled to be launched by the Japanese                      in 1996.  This seminar therefore is particularly timely in                      that it will provide the opportunity for oceanographers from                    each country to discuss and develop a formal structure to                       review plans for both Sea-WiFS and OCTS.                                                                                                                        The seminar is to held on May 6-10, 1991 at the East-West                       Center, Honolulu, Hawaii.  The co-organizers are Dr. James A.                   Yoder, Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode                     Island and Dr. Hajime Fukushima, School of Marine Science and                   Technology, Tokai University, Japan.  Specific topics to be                     discussed at the seminar include (1) new developments in                        satellite ocean color research; (2) the possibilities for                       exchanging ocean color data between US and Japanese scientists;                 and (3) the compilation of specific recommendations to NASA                     (US space agency) and NASDA (Japanese space agency) that will                   improve and enhance the scientific utility of ocean color                       data.  It is hoped that as a result of the seminar                              oceanographers from both the US and Japan, and from other                       countries, will be able to easily work with the satellite                       ocean color data collected from these two sensors, and make                     comparisons with the data collected from the earlier mission                    in this area.",
