 "awd_abstract_narration": "High density information storage is an emerging                                 technology crucial to international economic                                    competitiveness.  Magnetic and magneto-optic high                               density storage will continue to grow in economic                               importance for at least the next fifteen years, and                             perhaps beyond that.  We propose to carry out a                                 research program in magnetic microstructures as                                 applied to information storage.  The research will                              study several fundamental issues that should be                                 addressed to bring the technology closer to thermal                             and quantum limits:  Experimental investigations                                and modeling of the relation of physical and                                    magnetic microstructure to fluctuations and noise is                            expected to lead the way to storage media with                                  controlled and programmed microstructures.  We                                  plan to introduce novel computing methods using                                 massively parallel processors into the                                          micromagnetic modeling.  Studies of medium and                                  transducer micromagnetics will be aimed toward                                  multielement sensors.  Such sensors will be needed                              for servo systems capable of high density recording                             track following.  We will also explore their possible                           application to adaptive sensing as an innovative                                method of eliminating microstructure related                                    medium noise.  This will involve research on signal                             processing algorithms appropriate to these sensors.                             A breakthrough in even one of these directions will                             have a far ranging technological and economic                                   impact.  Apart from the direct technological                                    benefits expected from this research, it will have a                            lasting impact through its mission of teaching gifted                           professionals principles of information storage                                 technology and magnetics, engineering disciplines                               that are underrepresented in United States                                      universities to the serious detriment of our                                    international competitiveness.",
