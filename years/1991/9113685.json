The project will                     provide ethnographic information about people purchasing and                    using pharmaceuticals.  Using participant observation, and                      structured as well as unstructured interviews with consumers and                pharmacists the project will study the marketing, distributing,                 interpretation and uses of biomedical pharmaceuticals.  The                     research will enhance our knowledge of the medical belief system                and the resultant treatment-seeking process which will help                     researchers, health care providers, and policy makers to better                 understand the basis for health care decisions and the use, and                 misuse, or pharmaceuticals.                                                                                                                                     This research is important because the \"folk medicine\" of                       pharmaceuticals is very little studied, at the same time that the               world's population is urbanizing at a fast pace, and                            multinational corporations are providing pharmaceuticals all over               the world in retail outlets with no prescription control.                       Understand one case study of urban pharmaceutical use will be                   valuable indicating areas of potential concern as well as                       benefit.",
