 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal research is directed at developing an extraction                   technique to recover proteins from an aqueous solution                          utilizing a temperature-sensitive microemulsion phase.  The                     technique may be utilized as a primary recovery step for                        large-scale bioseparations.  By utilizing liquid phase mass                     transfer, residence times for primary isolation can be                          minimized and protease action eliminated.  Microemulsions                       possess several processing advantages over two-phase aqueous                    systems for such and extraction technique, including ease of                    phase disengagement (eliminating the need for capital-                          intensive centrifuges) and low viscosity materials (allowing                    for faster mass transfer).  By utilizing a nonionic                             surfactant, an mild temperature increase can be utilized to                     recover the protein in a concentrated form instead of                           utilizing chemical addition as currently practiced for ionic                    surfactant reverse micellar systems.  Nonionic temperature-                     sensitive microemulsions require the incorporation of an                        affinity ligand to obtain the high degree of specificity                        desired.  A reversible inhibitor of a model enzyme, \u001a-                          galactosidase, will be chemically attached to the ethylene                      oxide adduct of the nonionic surfactant employed to form the                    temperature-sensitive microemulsion.  The partitioning of \u001a-                    galactosidase into the formulated microemulsion will be                         investigated as a function of temperature.  Solubilization of                   the enzyme is expected to occur at a low temperature (4\u001aC),                     while demulsification and enzyme recovery will occur at a                       higher temperature (35\u001aC) which is well below the denaturation                  temperature for \u001a-galactosidase (50% denaturation occurs at                     57\u001aC).  This microemulsion system will then be utilized to                      study the processing advantages of a temperature-sensitive                      microemulsion on a bench-scale continuous separation unit.",
