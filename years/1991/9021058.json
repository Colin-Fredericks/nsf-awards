 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                     Chemistry, focuses on continued development of Fourier                          transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.  The work                  promises to enhance the development of mass spectrometry, a                     very important analytical technique.                                                                                                                            The project tackles the problem of external ion injection and                   linearized excitation/detection.  Both theoretical modelling                    and equipment building and testing are planned.  New theory to                  be studied will include general spectroscopic aspects, and will                 focus on Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT/ICR)                     mass spectrometry.   New instrumental developments will include                 studies of ion trap design and characterization, ion guides for                 ion external injection, and dual-channel SWIFT and detection                    modules.  New experiments will be performed to directly                         determine the ICR orbital radius from the detected ICR signal,                  together with experiments to study the use of a fast neutral                    beam ion source for involatile samples and a bilateral                          frequency sweep for ion injection.  Some analytical and                         chemical applications regarding actinide metal complexes,                       stereochemical effects, gas-phase basicities of carbenes,                       osmium cluster ion chemistry and applications to the analysis                   of polymers and electrode surfaces are also planned.",
