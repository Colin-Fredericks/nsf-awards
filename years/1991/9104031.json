 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subject of the special year funded by this award will be               interdisciplinary in nature, emphasizing developing connections                 between topology and modular representation theory with                         applications to algebraic K-theory, algebraic geometry, algebraic               number theory, and the cohomology of groups.  Algebraic topology                has freely employed numerous techniques from algebra and algebraic              geometry.  Analysis of splittings in the stable homotopy category               now employs modular representation of finite groups and global                  studies of the stable homotopy category have introduced familiar                concepts from algebraic number theory.  On the other hand, the                  application of topological techniques to study algebraic cycles and             the topological analysis of rings of integers in number theory                  provide two very recent examples that the interaction goes both                 ways.  The solutions of the Sullivan and Segal Conjectures have                 lead to numerous connections with the representation theory of                  compact Lie groups and these connections have provided powerful new             techniques in homotopy theory.                                                       This grant will fund an Emphasis Year on the above subject at              Northwestern University during 1991-92.  An integral part of this               special year is an international conference to be held in March,                1992.  This special year and conference are timely and will provide             a needed forum for new developments and a foundation for further                results.",
