 "awd_abstract_narration": "Application of the laser is so widespread in industry and                       research that today's undergraduates, especially those                          considering a scientific career need an exposure to lasers and                  modern optics at the undergraduate level.  This project expands                 the two-semester sophomore Optics Laboratory course at                          Manhattan College to include experiments using lasers and                       modern instrumentation.  The optics laboratory is envisioned as                 the place where students gain experimental facility in the use                  of this equipment in order to prepare them for future                           independent research.  The final six weeks of the course are                    dedicated to independent but guided project work which                          interested students could pursue in their junior and senior                     years with a view toward completion of the project in their                     Senior Thesis course.  In order to carry out this program,                      equipment is being acquired which serves the following                          purposes:a) provides students with a wide range of options in                   their selection of a project, b) enables students to gain some                  facility in the operation of the up-to-date optical equipment                   and instrumentation, and c)is sophisticated enough to allow                     students to continue development of their projects through                      their junior and senior years.  NSF grant funds are being                       matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
