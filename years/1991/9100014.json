 "awd_abstract_narration": "The seminal work of A.A. Markoff in 1872 described the degree              of approximability of badly approximable real numbers in terms of               a sequence of quadratic forms and their homogeneous minima.  The                study of this - the first Markoff Chain - and of the corresponding              theory for other real numbers and forms has made considerable                   progress over the last twenty years.  One direction has been to                 study the structure of the spectrum itself.  A second direction has             been to increase the understanding of the relevance of hyperbolic               geometry and the connection with the algebra of the free group on               two generators.  Much of the detailed technical calculations rely               on the cutting sequences of the geodesics which in turn are related             to the so-called two-distance sequences arising in the study of                 quasi-crystals.                                                                      This grant will partially support a six day workshop on the                Markoff spectrum and higher dimensional approximation constants to              be held at Brigham Young University in May, 1991.  The workshop                 will facilitate the exchange of information and will encourage the              research of about thirty mathematicians working in several related              areas of mathematics connected with Diophantine Approximation.                  Recent results in this area make such a workshop most timely.",
