 "awd_abstract_narration": "Believe and Achieve is a comprehensive and integrated                         curriculum of mathematics, science, and critical thinking                       especially designed for minority and female junior high school                  students.  The program uses videotapes and written lessons                      developed by faculty at the University of St. Thomas.  The                      major components of Believe and Achieve are: (1) instructional                  materials especially designed for minority and other                            underrepresented groups, which contain strategies for                           increasing these students' confidence and achievement; (2)                      interdisciplinary instruction among the mathematics, science,                   and English classes with material from each of the classes used                 to emphasize points in the other classes, and critical thinking                 and problem solving skills emphasized throughout; (3) an                        intensive five-week summer program, held on the University of                   St. Thomas campus, with a particular emphasis on computer                       programming, a hands on science project, and concepts of                        physics; and (4) a network of resources focused on the                          importance and usefulness of mathematics, science, and critical                 thinking, and on helping to motivate student to higher                          achievement.  In many cases, students in the program are                        learning mathematics and science two years earlier than they                    normally would.  In addition, the students are given                            opportunities to achieve success solving problems with                          mathematics which increases their confidence and interest in                    pursuing advanced courses.  Teachers and students have been                     very responsive to this success.  Currently over 1200 students                  and 40 teachers are taking part in the program.  Within the                     year, it is estimated that 2000 students and 60 teachers will                   be involved.  The support of the NSF will allow the number of                   students in the program to increase rapidly.",
