 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Miami International Symposia on Multi-Phase Transport and                   Particulate Phenomena have now been expanded to include new                     areas, including Heat Transfer in Fire and Combustion Systems,                  Heat Transfer and Flow through Porous Media, Heat Transfer in                   Superconductor Processing, Heat and Mass Transfer in Food and                   Polymer Processing, Heat and Mass Transfer in Bioengineering,                   Heat Transfer in Composite Media, and Lasers and Thermal                        Imaging.  The Symposia provides an international forum for                      scientific exchange of the latest research results in these                     areas between participants from universities, research                          establishments, industrial and government organizations,                                                                                                        It is the objective of the symposium-workshop to provide a                      comprehensive state-of-the-art assessment of the progress of                    research, development and applications in heat and mass                         transfer and to provide an international forum for information                  exchange among active researchers.  It is also desired to                       establish a rational basis for the identification of areas of                   research in heat and mass transfer and recommendations for                      future research and development needs.  There is a need for                     improved communications between research workers in university                  laboratories and in industry on these subject areas.  The                       symposium-workshop and the subsequent dissemination of the                      reports and the proceedings thereof will seek to accomplish                     these objectives.",
