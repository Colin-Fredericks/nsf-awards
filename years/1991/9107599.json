 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synchem systems is a large knowledge-based domain specific                  heuristic problem solving program that is able to find valid                    synthesis routes for organic molecules of substantial interest                  and complexity without online guidance on the part of its user.                 Synchem requires an extensive knowledge base to make it routinely               useful.  However, it is very difficult to engage domain experts                 to the long-term dedication and intensity of commitment necessary               to create a genuinely productive knowledge base.  In order to                   deal with the debilitating knowledge-base bottleneck, machine                   learning programs will be devised that can use large computer-                  readable databases of specific reaction instances to provide                    training examples for algorithms designed to extract the                        underlying reaction schemata through inductive and deductive                    generalization.  This approach will be augmented by the                         methodology that is usually described as explanation-based                      learning.  Since the individual reaction entries in most                        databases are often haphazardly sorted and classified, another                  machine learning program will partition the input databases into                coherent reaction classes using the methodology of conceptual                   clustering.  To make it possible for Synchem to deal with the                   explosion of reasonable pathways that would be the result of a                  successful effort to greatly expand the knowledge base, the                     inference engine will reformulated for distributed parallel                     search of the problem space.",
