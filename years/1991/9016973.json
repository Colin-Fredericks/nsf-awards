 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to apply the newly developed method of pulsed,                   time resolved photoacoustics to the study of photosynthesis and                 photoinitiated electron transfer reactions.  This methodology                   allows the determination of the enthalpies of the initial                       reactions, that of the time resolved steps, and that of the                     slow reactants or stable products.  The kinetics of                             photosynthetic and photochemical reactions are now well                         understood, and intermediate steps fairly well known.  However,                 the thermodynamic parameters of these intermediates are only                    poorly known.  Since the pulsed, time resolved photoacoustic                    methodology identifies a change in enthalpy with its kinetics,                  the latter can be used to identify the intermediate.  The                       thermodynamic efficiency of the intact system: cell or a whole                  leaf, can be so studied.  The results will allow a much better                  understanding of the energetics of the photosynthetic process                   and of electron transfer reactions.                                                                                                                             Dr. Mauzerall will also continue to work on the sizes of                        photosynthetic units and on the effect of the molecular                         environment on electron tunneling reactions.",
