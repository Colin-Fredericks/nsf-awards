 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research address the problem of relational query                           optimization for general purpose parallel machines.  The                        principle objective of this project to develop query optimizer                  that will generate efficient query plans for parallel machines.                 The three main components of a database query optimizer are its                 query plan representation, its cost model, and its search                       algorithm.  This project addresses the issue of developing a plan               representation that incorporates intra- and inter-operator                      parallelism, as well as pipelining.  Furthermore, cost models                   will be developed which distinguish between the total work done,                i.e. the (sequential) time it would take on a uni-processor and                 total (parallel) time taken on a multi-processor.  The cost model               depends on the query and database parameters, as well as                        architecture parameters.  A cost-based search algorithm selects                 efficient (low cost) query plans.  Since the search space is much               larger than that found in uni-processor query optimization, this                research will develop new heuristics to prune the search space.                 Furthermore, since a multiprocessor is available, the research                  will also investigate applicability of parallel processing to the               optimization process itself.  The results of this research will                 have an impact on efficient query processing in parallel                        relational databases.",
