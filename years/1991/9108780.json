 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research seeks to gain knowledge of protein                   structure through increased understanding of the microscopic                    interactions and mechanisms of folding initiation.  Peptide                     folding events will be studied using a novel combination of                     configurational energy methods, statistical mechanics and                       statistical clustering techniques.                                                   The microscopic mechanisms leading to nascent folding events               are generally unknown.  Two extremely long molecular dynamics                   simulations (2.2 nanoseconds each), recently carried out on a                   pentapeptide that forms stable reverse turns in solutions, will                 be analyzed by statistically based methods to identify folding                  pathways.  The large number of conformations obtained from the                  simulations (>30,000) will be clustered into structurally similar               groups.  Transitions between the conformations in the reduced                   data set will be analyzed for concerted dihedral angle changes.                 The mechanisms causing these conformational transitions will be                 deduced from intra-peptide and peptide-solvent interactions,                    assessed for each cluster.  This research develops new techniques               for the analysis of large numbers of conformations resulting from               long simulations, and the knowledge of folding pathways gained                  can lead to the design of more computationally efficient folding                simulations.                                                                         Cluster analysis and other surveys of protein structures                   have shown that certain N-cap and C-cap conformations dominate                  helix termini.  Free energy simulations will be used to determine               the free energy contribution of these capping structures to a-                  helix initiation and propagation, and their potential to act as                 helix stop signals.  The free energy contributed to helix                       formation by charge/helix dipole interactions will be calculated,               an the role of solvent structure in capping will be examined.",
