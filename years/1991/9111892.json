 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to continue prior NSF supported research to address            various technical problems that impede progress toward software reuse.          A comprehensive approach to reuse has been developed, which permits             people to write formal specifications of reusable components, to                certify their correctness using both verification and testing, and to           build particularly efficient implementations for them.  The overall             objective of this project is to demonstrate the practicality of a new           generation of formally specified, certified, and efficient reusable             software components.  Specifically, the researchers intend to design            understandable formal specifications for a representative sample of             general-purpose reusable software components; to show how to use these          specifications to verify and to test the correctness of both                    implementations of these modules and their clients; and to apply                several novel data structures and algorithms to build efficient                 implementations of these components.  Successful completion of the              project will include among its results (1) a catalog of formal                  specifications of reusable software components having certifiably               correct and efficient implementations, and (2) a \"handbook of design\"           containing explicit guidelines for developing other reusable                    components in a similar way.",
