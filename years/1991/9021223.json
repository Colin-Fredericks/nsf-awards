 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in theoretical, computational, and applied                      linguistics demonstrate a need to integrate information across                  all the individual linguistic modules that are involved in the                  comprehension of spoken discourse.  To facilitate this                          integration, a workshop on the Grammatical Foundations of Prosody               and Discourse will be held between June 23rd and July 7th, 1991,                at the University of California at Santa Cruz, during the first                 two weeks of the Summer Institute sponsored by the Linguistic                   Society of America and co-sponsored by the Association for                      Computational Linguistics and the American Association for                      Artificial Intelligence.                                                                                                                                        The workshop, which will culminate in a short conference, will                  bring together internationally known researchers, both from                     academia and industry, who work at the interfaces between                       linguistic specializations.  It will provide the opportunity for                researchers in speech processing, phonetics, phonology, syntax,                 semantics, and discourse to work together to develop a common                   understanding of crucial theoretical, descriptive, and                          computational issues in spoken language understanding across                    their subject areas.                                                                                                                                            An important task for the two week long meeting will be to                      explore how information expressed in one module of the grammar,                 syntactic structure for example, can best be organized to convey                all the information needed by other related modules, such as                    discourse and prosody.  Such an exploration is needed for the                   development of more robust computational systems for natural                    language understanding, translation, and generation, as well as                 being directly applicable to speech understanding and synthesis                 technology.  Holding the meeting at the Linguistic Institute and                encouraging participation by Institute attendees at many of the                 workshop functions as well as at the public conference will                     assure that the concerns to be addressed will be disseminated                   among the linguistic community at large.",
