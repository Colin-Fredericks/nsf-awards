 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical attempts to understand visual perception often                      partition perceptual processes into those processes that can be                 performed simultaneously and those that must be performed                       successively.  Most theorists have assumed that figure-ground                   organization and shape recognition are performed successively.                  Figure-ground organization is the determination of which regions                in the visual field represent figures and which constitute the                  backgrounds against which the figures are viewed.  Figure and                   ground regions are separated by a contour; the region to which                  the contour is assigned appears to be the recognizable figure,                  whereas the other region appears to be an undifferentiated ground               which simply appears to continue behind the figure.                                                                                                             Despite the linkage between shape recognition and figure-ground                 organization, these theorists have argued that figure-ground                    organization must precede shape recognition, appealing either                   explicitly or implicitly to the argument that one cannot                        recognize a figure until there is a figure to be recognized.                    Consequently, figure-ground relationships are generally conceived               to be determined by stimulus variables only (i.e., variables such               as the relative areas, symmetries, convexities, and enclosure of                the two regions on either side of a contour).  Contrary to this                 argument, however, previous studies in Peterson's laboratory have               shown that certain shape recognition analyses are conducted prior               to the determination of figure and ground.  These experiments can               be readily integrated into current theoretical approaches to                    shape recognition, thereby rendering this argument obsolete.                                                                                                    The planned experiments will examine the conditions under which                 shape recognition processes can contribute to figure-ground                     computations.  One series of experiments will identify which                    specific types of contours (e.g., luminance contours, binocular                 disparity contours, and/or color contours) permit shape                         recognition computations to be performed simultaneously with the                analysis of the stimulus variables relevant to figure-ground                    organization.  Another series of experiments will test whether                  the shape representations corresponding to both interpretations                 of a reversible figure-ground stimulus are activated                            simultaneously prior to the assignment of the figure-ground                     contour.  A third series of experiments will attempt to explicate               the rules governing the interactions between shape recognition                  variables and stimulus variables in figure-ground computations.                                                                                                 These experiments will provide information about fundamental                    aspects of visual processing, including the manner in which                     analyses of physical variables interact with cognitive variables                in perceptual organization.  These experiments are certain to be                relevant to the design of surrogates for physical scenes.",
