 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides funding for four U.S.                       scientists to participate in a five day conference in New                       Delhi, India in the second week of January 1991.  The                           conference will focus on MOS Analog VLSI Circuit                                Engineering.  The Indian organizer is Dr. A.B.                                  Bhattacharyya, Chairman, Center for Applied research in                         Electronics at the Indian Institute of Technology, New                          Delhi.  Topics to be covered will include: CMOS process                         technology and analog circuits; MOS device modeling;                            sensors and transducers micropower design; conversion                           circuits; filters; design methods and automation; mixed                         mode simulation; automated physical layout; and emerging                        research topics.                                                                                                                                                Scope:  The primary emphasis in this conference is on                           bringing researchers in academia with technical people                          engaged in research and development in industry and to                          address questions in design and automation.  In addition,                       areas where potential collaboration can result and would be                     beneficial will be identified.  A number of U.S. electronic                     companies with branches in India will be represented in the                     conference.",
