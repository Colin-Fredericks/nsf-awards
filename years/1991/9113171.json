The topics for discussion at the                 conference cover a number of important areas of differential                    equations:  ordinary and partial differential equations, integral               and functional differential equations, and applications of these                classes of equations to problems in physics and biology.                             The purpose of this conference is to promote research and                  education in the theory and application of differential                         equations.  The conference will provide a forum for researchers                 in the southeast and atlantic regions to exchange ideas with each               other and with colleagues from around the country and the world.                In addition, the conference will give graduate students and                     recent Ph.D.'s the opportunity to present their work, meet other                researchers, and learn about the latest results in their field.",
