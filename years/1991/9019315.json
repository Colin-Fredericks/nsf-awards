 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a continuation and extension of an existing               project on the study of dynamics of tropical intraseasonal                      oscillation.  The objective of the study is to enhance physical                 understanding of the complex behavior of intraseasonal                          disturbances in spatially varying mean tropical circulations,                   their interactions with the oceanic mixed layer and their roles                 in ENSO (El Nino-southern Oscillation) evolution.  Three research               thrusts are proposed:                                                                a)  Effects of mean tropical circulation on dynamics of the                intraseasonal disturbances;                                                          b)  Intraseasonal variations of air-sea interface variables                and oceanic influence on atmospheric intraseasonal disturbances;                     c)  Response of ocean to intraseasonal variation of surface                winds and the links between intraseasonal and interannual                       variations.                                                                          The PI will adopt a combination of theoretical and empirical               analysis.  A free atmosphere-boundary layer coupled model                       developed in the existing project will be extended to include                   basic flow and coupling with an ocean mixed layer model, forming                a dynamics framework for theoretical analysis.  Interim COADS                   ship reports (1980-1987) generated by global data assimilation                  systems of th European Center for Medium Range Weather Froecasts                (ECMWF), and sea-level data collected at the TOGA Sea Level                     Center (1975-1987) will be used for diagnostic studies.                                                                                                              This research is important because it attempts to increase                 the level of understanding of climate processes that influence                  climate variability around the world.",
