 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific aims of this project center on the structure study                 of cytochrome c oxidase by digital image processing of electron                 micrographs of 2-dimensional crystals.  Cytochrome oxidase is                   the terminal component of mitochondrial electron transport                      which is responsible for generating energy in the form of ATP                   for use by all cells undergoing aerobic respiration.                            Cytochrome oxidase can be purified in detergent solubilized                     form as both a monomer and a dimer which are equally active in                  electron transfer.  Likewise, 2-dimensional crystals of                         monomers and of dimers have been isolated and preliminary                       structural studies completed.  Dr. Frey has recently obtained                   images of both crystal forms at a resolution of approximately                   10A by cryo-electron microscopy, and the principal goal of this                 project is to determine the 3-dimensional structures of both                    monomers and dimers at this resolution.  Specific sites on the                  enzyme will be identified by labeling with molecules visible                    by electron microscopy.  Cytochrome c, binds with high affinity                 to monomer crystals, and the site of binding has been                           identified in 2-dimensional projection.  A maleimide derivative                 of a water soluble undecagold cluster compound selectively                      labels Cys-115 of subunit III, and preliminary results show the                 location of this compound in 2-dimensional projections of dimer                 crystals.  The binding sites of both molecules will be                          determined in 3-dimensions.  The results will be interpreted                    to provide not only the position of both binding sites but also                 the orientation of cytochrome c bound to cytochrome oxidase.                    finally, the form of cytochrome oxidase most active in proton                   pumping will be determined by electron microscopy of vesicles                   reconstituted from purified cytochrome oxidase and                              phospholipids.  The proportion of monomers and dimers observed                  in these vesicles will be compared with their efficiency of                     proton pumping to determine whether there is a correlation                      between the two properties.",
