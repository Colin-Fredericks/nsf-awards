 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematical theory of sets first developed in response to deep             problems in the foundations of the calculus and the theory of                   functions.  After considerable initial success, progress in these               areas came to an abrupt halt and an number of natural open problems             stubbornly resisted solution.  The explanation came only later; in              fact, these problems cannot be answered on the basis of the                     standard axioms.  This discovery led to a search for new axioms,                and today's set theorists are faced with two distinct theories,                 theories that provide opposing answers to many of the previously                open problems.  The question of which of these theories is true is              not strictly mathematical; one isn't looking for a proof.  Previous             axioms were judged on their purported \"obviousness\", but the                    current candidates enjoy no such status.  Thus a novel                          methodological problem arises:  how can such hypotheses be judged?                                                                                              Professor Maddy's goal is to provide a philosophical analysis of                the nature of this question -- is such-and-such a an axiom                      candidate true? -- and to delineate that range of methods                       appropriate to answering it.  She will then apply these methods to              one particular new axiom candidate:  the assumption that all sets               are constructible.  This research is of great importance for the                philosophy of science and foundational studies of mathematics.",
