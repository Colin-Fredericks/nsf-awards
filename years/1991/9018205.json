 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr.  Honzatko proposes to carry out x-ray crystallographic                      investigations which will reveal the structural basis for the                   mechanisms of catalysis and inhibition of adenylosuccinate                      synthetase from Escherichia coli, the enzyme which governs the                  first committed step in the de novo synthesis of adenine                        nucleotides.  The synthetase from E. coli may be the first                      enzyme of the purine biosynthetic pathway for which a high                      resolution crystal structure will be available.  Furthermore,                   the synthetase is a prime example of an important class of                      enzme involved in ternary reactions.  Indeed, adenylosuccinate                  synthetase is a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolyase which                   is either distantly related to GTP binding proteins of mammals                  or represents an altogehter distinct class of  GTP hydrolyses.                                                                                                  Two different crystal forms of adenlylosuccinate synthetase                     have been obtained and are under investigation .  The complex                   of the enzyme with succinate and the complex with succinate,                    inosine monophosphate and magnesium guanosine diphosphate.                      Studies of these two crystal forms will reveal the details of                   substrate-enzyme interactions and the conformational changes                    induced in the synthetase by the binding of substrates and                      substrate analogues.  Additional structural investigations are                  planned as well, specifically of the complex of the antibiotic                  hadacidin with the first crystalline form and several mutant                    forms of the enzyme.",
