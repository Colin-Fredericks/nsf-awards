 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the proposed California Minority                  Graduate Forum is to increase the number of minority students                   from Southern California who eventually enroll in graduate                      school.  The Forum is being held for approximately 500 juniors,                 seniors and master's minority students throughout Southern                      California who have indicated an interest in attending graduate                 schools.  We have a commitment and from the participating                       colleges and universities that half of these students will be                   from disciplines which the National Science Foundation                          traditionally supports.  Students interested in going to                        professional school such as law or medicine will not be allowed                 to participate. Representatives from 100 graduate schools                       throughout the United States will participate and the students                  will be able to discuss opportunities for graduate study with                   these individuals.  Several workshops will be given on topics                   ranging from financial aid to taking the GRE examination.                       Details on how to prepare for the exam as well as specific                      test-taking strategies will be discussed in the workshops.                      There will also be some motivational speeches by minority                       faculty role models and minority students who are currently in                  doctoral programs.  Representatives from NSF will also be                       invited to speak or participate in the forum panels and                         workshop.",
