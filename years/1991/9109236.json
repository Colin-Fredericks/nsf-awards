 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses a fundamental problem of language                       acquisition, how young children figure out the meanings of words.               Children must determine what a novel word refers to from a                      limited amount of information about how a new term is used.                     Thus, word learning poses a difficult inductive problem for                     children.  This research proceeds from the premise that part of                 the solution is that children focus quickly and effectively on                  the correct meaning of terms because they consider only some                    kinds of hypotheses.  One way children may limit hypotheses is in               accordance with the mutual exclusivity assumption, which states                 that children expect each object to have only one label.                        Although previous findings strongly suggest that preschool                      children use mutual exclusivity to guide their interpretation of                a novel label, there is as yet little evidence about children                   beginning to acquire language.  Moreover, alternative                           explanations for some of the findings have been raised.                         Controlled experimental tests of these alternative explanations                 will establish how mutual exclusivity is used by beginning                      language learners.  The research will determine how mutual                      exclusivity supplements other information and how it provides                   children with a safeguard against certain errors.  This work will               enrich our understanding of how word-learning assumptions                       interact with cognitive, linguistic, and environmental factors to               help very young children figure out what words mean.  This                      improved understanding of the basic processes underlying language               acquisition might better enable early childhood educators to                    provide learning environments that will facilitate word learning,               and may promote more accurate diagnoses and more effective                      remediation of language disorders.",
