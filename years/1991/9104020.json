 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commensal and parasitic protozoa will be identified from                      Dendrobates auratus and Dendrobates pumilio, both wild caught                   in Costa Rica and captive bred.  Prevalence and density of                      infections will be recorded, and the fauna compared between                     species under both wild caught and captive bred conditions.                     Protozoa, (particularly the hemoflagellates and ciliates,                       opalinids and flagellates in the rectum), will be identified                    to genus and species using light microscopy (especially                         protargol impregnation), and scanning and transmission electron                 microscopy.  Protozoa will also be examined in histological                     sections.                                                                         Little is known of the protozoan fauna of threatened poison                   arrow frogs, and the project results will:  increase knowledge                  of their biology; enable their fauna to be compared with that                   of other anuran families, increasing understanding of their                     evolution; and allow more effective care and treatment of                       captive dendrobatids.  Descriptions of several new species of                   protozoans are anticipated, of particular interest being the                    potentially pathogenic and poorly described diplomonads.  The                   project also furthers VPW program objectives to provide                         opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigators'                        enhanced visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In                    this project, the proposed activities which contribute to the                   second objective include:  participating in an outreach                         program, targeting high school minority women interested in                     pursuing a career in life sciences; teaching an undergraduate                   course in basic parasitology, emphasizing the impact of                         parasites on human health; and teaching a graduate course on                    parasites of aquatic animals.",
