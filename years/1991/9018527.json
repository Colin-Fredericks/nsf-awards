 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the development and exploitation of               a state-of-the art infrared camera system for the wavelength                    interval.  The new UCLA infrared camera will be based largely on                the well-established series of IRCAMs developed for the 3.8m                    United Kingdom Infrared Telescope by McLean during the period                   1984-1989, but it will be more sensitive than its predecessors.                 The improved design will allow for two wavelength channels,                     making it possible to image in two colors simultaneously and to                 optimize independently the low background region from 1-2 um and                the higher background region from 2-5 um.  Initially, the best                  pixel detectors available will be selected by comparing several                 different devices but the camera design will permit an upgrade to               even larger detector formats later.  A special feature of the new               infrared camera will be a low-background cryogenic coronagraph                  mode which may be used in conjunction with an imaging polarimeter               mode.  The camera will also have a grism and be compatible with                 several telescopes.  The new instrument will enable the co-                     investigators and students at UCLA, and collaborators elsewhere                 to pursue a challenging observational program.  The key topics of               the science program are:  an extensive search at several infrared               wavelengths for very low mass stars and sub-stellar objects                     (brown dwarfs) or possibly large planets; ultra-deep, multi-                    wavelength searches for protogalaxies and galaxy phenomena at                   high redshifts; infrared coronagraphic polarimetry with high                    angular resolution of dusty star formation regions and the disks                that form around both young stellar objects and evolved stars; a                survey of the occurrence of carbon-rich dust particles around                   Wolf-Rayet stars; cosmic distance scales using infrared light                   curves of variable stars; studies of dust-embedded active                       galactic nuclei.",
