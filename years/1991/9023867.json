 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will attempt, purportedly for the first time, to                   fabricate thin film heterostructures of electroactive polymers                  in which the structure and architecture of the films are                        manipulated at the molecular level.  The new materials formed                   from these complex molecular assemblies will be studied for                     the determination of their optical properties, electrical                       properties, which will provide new insights into the                            fundamental behavior of electroactive polymers and reveal new                   opportunities for thin film devices and microelectronic                         sensors.                                                                                                                                                        The overall objectives of the research is to fabricate,                         characterize, and evaluate novel, highly ordered, molecular                     assemblies of electroactive polymers.  Specifically, .e                         monolayer forming systems based on electroactive polymers will                  be developed and utilized in conjunction with previously                        developed electroactive monolayers to fabricate complex                         heterostructures comprised of functionally distinct layers                      arranged at the molecular level to achieve specific                             electrical, optical, or chemical response.  Particular                          attention will be paid to monolayer forming systems that                        provide the highest level of order and orientation of the                       electroactive polymer component and a high degree of                            processing flexibility.",
