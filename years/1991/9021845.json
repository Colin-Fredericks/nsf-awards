 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium of the state of Alabama,               which serves 21 state academic institutions including three                     predominantly black colleges and universities and which operates                and maintains the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, for the renovation and                repair of Marine Science Hall and for the replacement of attendant              buildings.  Marine Science Hall houses multi-disciplinary                       biological and behavioral science research and research training                activities in coastal marine science.  This building was                        constructed in 1950 and last renovated in 1990.  The ARFMP grant of             $585,000 and $585,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will              be used to modernize these research and research training                       facilities.  In order to relieve overcrowding and to provide                    suitable facilities for collaborative investigation, this project               will address the need to improve the current research                           infrastructure by repair or replacement of the physical structure               and its supporting systems.  Resulting from these changes will be               more space for laboratory use and the creation of a video analysis              facility and an isotope facility.                                                                                                                               This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of undergraduates, graduates and               postdoctoral students in interdisciplinary research.  This                      modernization project makes a further contribution to the human                 resources pipeline because of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab's unique               ability to introduce pre-college students to the knowledge                      generated by the Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium's                     scientists and collaborators.",
