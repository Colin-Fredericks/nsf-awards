 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last Pleistocene glacial advance, ice covered                   much of the modern day range of the threespine stickleback                      (Gasterosteus aculeatus).  As the glaciers began to retreat about               14,000 years ago, a diversity of freshwater habitats were created               and subsequently colonized by the marine threespine stickleback.                Today, the resultant freshwater populations are undergoing rapid                evolutionary diversification throughout northwestern North                      America, and in some cases speciation has occurred.  This                       remarkable, recent radiation holds great promise for providing                  information on the patterns and mechanisms of evolutionary                      change.  It also provides a model for adaptive radiations that                  have new genera and higher taxa.                                                     The proposed research will determine, for the first time,                  the reproductive behavior patterns exhibited by marine threespine               stickleback, and the extent to which they vary among sites.  This               is essential for interpreting the patterns of change in the                     radiation because the marine form is thought to have given rise                 to the divergent freshwater forms observed today.  In addition,                 the diversity of reproductive behavior in twenty or more Alaskan                freshwater populations will be documented.  These observations                  will not only provide a first approximation of the range of                     behavioral diversification among Alaskan freshwater populations,                but will enable the investigators to select populations for                     future research on the evolution of specific behavioral                         phenotypes.",
