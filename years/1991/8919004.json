 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-range goals of the proposed research are to determine,                 at the molecular level, the structural adaptations that enable                  the tubulins of Antarctic fishes to polymerize at the low body                  temperatures of -2 to +2 C experienced by these cold-adapted                    vertebrates, and to examine the dynamics of the fish                            microtubule.  The specific objectives of this project are four                  in number: 1) to clone and to sequence DNAs complementary to                    messenger RNAs (cDNAs) that encode the alpha and beta tubulins                  of an Antarctic fish; 2) to determine the structure and number                  of the tubulin genes within the genome of an Antarctic fish; 3)                 to determine the organization and functions of the structural                   domains of tubulins from Antarctic fishes; and 4) to                            characterize the dynamic behaviors of Antarctic fish                            microtubule at low temperatures.  Experiments will be performed                 on tubulin cDNAs and genes derived from the nucleic acids of                    Notothenia coriiceps neglecta and on microtubule proteins                       purified from three Antarctic fish species: N. coriiceps                        neglecta, N. gibberifrons, and Chaenocephalus aceratus.  The                    nucleotide sequences of the alpha and beta tubulin cDNAs and                    genes from N. coriiceps neglecta will be established by                         standard methods.  The structural domains of tubulins that are                  necessary for the assembly of cold-stable microtubule will be                   defined by limited proteolytic digestion of the proteins                        followed by microtubule assembly assays.  Finally, the dynamics                 of Antarctic fish microtubule at low temperatures will be                       examined by electron-microscopic and video-enhanced light-                      microscopic methods.  Comparison of the primary sequences and                   structural domains of tubulins from Antarctic fishes with those                 of tubulins from temperate and warm-blooded vertebrates should                  reveal the structural features necessary for microtubule                        assembly at low temperatures.  This work will also provide, for                 the first time, valuable information concerning the structure                   of tubulin genes from an extreme Antarctic poikilotherms.",
