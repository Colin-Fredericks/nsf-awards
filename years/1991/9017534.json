 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to develop improvements in confocal microscopy               in three areas:  1) Solid-state photon detectors to increase                    system quantum efficiency (compared to the photomultiplier tube),               especially in the red and near-infrared.  2) The incorporation of               an additional,  full-time, operationally-transparent, detector                  chain for light backscattered by the specimen.  3) The                          development of a practical system of automatic optimal beam                     shaping so that the size of the focussed spot is always                         appropriate for the size of the voxels sampled (referred to the                 specimen).                                                                                                                                                      To insure that these developments are made available to general                 user groups as soon as possible, it is proposed that this                       prototype research take the form of a cooperative effort between                the PI and Bio-Rad Inc., a major American manufacturer of                       confocal equipment which has distinguished itself by its                        responsiveness to input from interested and competent users.                    Specifically, the support is sought to pay for partial salary,                  travel and laboratory expenses for research to be carried out at                the University of Cambridge and the Bio-Rad development                         laboratory in England by the PI while on sabbatical from the                    Integrated Microscopical Resource.  Some funds will also be used                during the six months preceding the sabbatical for acquiring                    necessary equipment in the US.",
