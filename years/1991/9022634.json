 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to continue the                                    development of a mathematical theory for the analysis                           and control of discrete event systems (DESs).  DESs                             arise in a variety of areas of practical application,                           including, for example, multi-robot systems,                                    manufacturing systems, data bases, distributed                                  computing, distributed and hierarchical optimization,                           queuing systems, mixed variable control systems, and                            the higher level intelligent control of complex                                 processes.  A number of proposals have been made for                            modeling and studying the various aspects of DESs of                            interest.  The recent work on the control of logical                            DESs has contributed to our understanding of some of                            the fundamental issues involved in the analysis of                              DESs.  Other approaches, particularly perturbation                              methods and likelihood ratio methods have had                                   considerable impact on the analysis, simulation and                             optimization of stochastic DES models.  The main                                thrust of the proposed research is to extend these two                          approaches by addressing issues such as real-time                               constraints, algorithmic complexity, aggregated models,                         mixed variable systems, and stochastic optimization                             using perturbation analysis and likelihood ratio                                derivative estimates.  The relationship between current                         models will also be investigated with the aim of                                unifying the tools available for the study of discrete-                         event systems.",
