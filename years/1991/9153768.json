 "awd_abstract_narration": "The title of this program is \"Boston Harbor Marine Research                     Program for Teachers.\"  Twenty well-prepared junior high                        school teachers will carry out marine research in Boston                        Harbor, focusing on a topic relevant to its pollution.                          Teachers will use a research vessel, oceanographic                              equipment and laboratory provided by Project Oceanology, a                      marine education center, and the University of                                  Massachusetts/Boston.  With the guidance of oceanographers                      and science educators, teachers will gain first-hand                            experience doing scientific research and will strengthen                        their understanding of the nature of science.  The program                      will also help teachers translate their experience into                         teaching methods and transfer it to their own classrooms to                     engage their students in scientific inquiry.  The program                       includes experimental design, laboratory investigations and                     field studies, data collection and analysis, presentation                       of results, and the design and testing of student research                      programs.  During 1993 and 1994, teachers will implement                        and test student applications of this program in a special                      summer session for minority and under-represented students                      at UMass/Boston and in programs in their schools.  Student                      programming will be designed and developed with the mutual                      support of their colleagues and the supervision of program                      staff.                                                                                                                                                          The program duration is 3 years, from Nov. 1, 1991 to Sept.                     30, 1994.  Non-NSF cost sharing is over 19% of the amount                       requested from NSF.",
