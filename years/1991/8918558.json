 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two central themes pervade many questions relating to the                  origin of patterns in biological diversity:  (1) How do patterns                of diversity in adaptation (for example, feeding specializations)               evolve within evolutionary lineages?  and (2) How are patterns                  in the geographic distributions of organisms generated through                  the interaction of biological and geological (for example,                      continental drift processes?  Hypotheses of evolutionary                        relationships (phylogeny) among members of a lineage are the                    foundation upon which answers to such questions are based.                           The proposed research will establish a detailed phylogeny                  for three lineages of Central and South American snakes selected                for their morphological and ecological diversity.  These will be                used to address questions concerning patterns of evolution of                   that diversity and will provide a historical framework for                      interpreting their distributions.  The lineages to be studied                   include the only snakes to have colonized the Galapagos Islands,                which have been considered a classic \"natural experiment \" for                  the study of evolutionary processes.  Field work associated with                the project will proved ecological information on the included                  species, specimens for morphological studies, and tissues for                   subsequent biochemical analyses.  Relationships among snakes will               be evaluated using morphological characters and biochemical                     characters of proteins (enzymes) and nucleic acids (DNA).  The                  phylogenies developed for these lineages will be directly                       applicable to questions concerning the evolutionary biology of                  these snakes.  More generally, however, there will be                           significance in addressing questions concerning evolutionary                    processes that generate diversity in morphology, and historical                 hypotheses concerning the distributional history (biogeography)                 of the Central and South American fauna.",
