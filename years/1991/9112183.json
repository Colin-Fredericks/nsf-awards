 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will involve the study of intermolecular radical                   trapping of captodative stabilized radicals.  This work has                     important implications in two major areas:  1) the development                  of new intermolecular radical traps and  2) the use of chiral                   glycine radical templates for the asymmetric synthesis of                       natural and non-natural amino acids.  Given the tremendous                      utility of radicals in organic synthesis there is a real need                   for the development of new intermolecular radical traps.                        Radical traps that will be developed include nitrones, stannyl                  nitronates, vinyl aziridines (for both the synthesis of allyl                   amines and pyrrolidines), enol stannanes, stannyl alkynes, and                  chiral dehydroalanines.  For the asymmetric synthesis of amino                  acids, several chiral glycine radical templates will be                         investigated including a chiral diketo piperazine, oxazolidine,                 and 9-phenyl menthol amino acid ester. Intermolecular trapping                  reactions of the chiral glycine radicals will be carried out                    with both established radical traps (such as allyl and vinyl                    stannanes) and with the novel radical trapping agents.  This                    work will be an important contribution to the areas of radical                  chemistry and asymmetric amino acid synthesis.                                  %%%                                                                             Research Planning Grants enable women who have not had prior                    independent Federal research support to develop a competitive                   research proposal.  This project involves the trapping of                       stabilized free radicals, i.e., molecules with unpaired                         electrons, for the construction of organic molecules.  Such                     reactions may have wide applicability in organic chemistry and                  complement other organic synthesis methods.",
