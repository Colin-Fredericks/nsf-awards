The award is made to an investigator             at an undergraduate institution (RUI award).  The project will                  trace the activities of selected anti-death penalty movement                    organizations from 1972 to the present.  The study will examine how             the organizations' ability to mobilize and recruit members depend               on their organizational infrastructure, on the resources they are               able to marshall, and on the political climate.  The investigator               will examine organizational records, and perform interviews with                members active in the organizations.                                                  This research will make an important contribution to the                  study of social movements.  It will also provide important insights             into the organizational strategies and dilemmas the anti-death                  penalty organizations have developed in response to widespread                  hostility to their cause and difficulties in maintaining the                    commitment of their members.",
