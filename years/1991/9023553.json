This workshop topic                                      is \"The Impact of a Less Regulated Utility                                      Environment on Power System Control and                                         Security\".  This workshop will bring together                                   approximately 35 individuals from academic                                      and research institutions to examine the                                        consequences that a less regulated, more                                        distributed utility environment will have for                                   research directions in electric power systems.                                  In particular, the impact of structural                                         changes on the nature of power system                                           control as well as likely changes in the                                        methodologies for maintaining secure and                                        reliable power.  The workshop will be                                           organized around five major panel                                               discussions, with an organizer and a small                                      panel making presentations and leading                                          discussion in each session.  Participants will                                  be asked to prepare a short \"brainstorming\"                                     paper for distribution during the workshop                                      to stimulate discussion in these sessions.                                                                                                                      Each panel will collaborate on producing a                                      summary paper from the panel's work and                                         from discussion, for inclusion in a workshop                                    proceedings.  The workshop organizers at                                        the University of Wisconsin will assemble                                       these proceedings and produce 400 copies                                        for distribution to document the results of                                     the workshop.",
