 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research program is a collaboration between the                    University of New Mexico, Air Products, and Sandia National                     Laboratories.  It is aimed at the development of a new class                    of ceramic membranes based on inorganic silicate polymers                       synthesized be sol-gel processing.  Using concepts of polymer                   physics, fractal geometry, and drying theory, the project                       develops strategies to tailor the membrane pore diameters                       within the range 0.2 - 3.0 nm appropriate for ultrafiltration                   and molecular separation of gaseous and liquid mixtures.                        Because the membranes are amorphous polymers rather than                        polycrystalline solids, the pore size is not limited by                         particle size as in normal ceramics.  Moreover, phase                           transitions and grain growth are avoided.  The gels and gel-                    derived films are characterized by surface acoustic wave                        methods, by imaging ellipsometry, and NMR proton spin                           relaxation.  Such ceramic membranes have excellent thermal,                     chemical, and mechanical stability and can be used in gas                       separations and industrial waste treatment.                                                                                                                     This proposal is jointly supported by NSF and the Electric                      Power Research Institute (EPRI), following a special NSF-EPRI                   research initiative on polymeric materials.",
