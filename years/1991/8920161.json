 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the University of Minnesota, requests funds to               establish a Science and Technology Center for Computation and                   Visualization of Geometric Structures.  The Director of the Center              will be Professor Albert Marden.                                                                                                                                The Center involves collaboration among eighteen mathematicians                 from thirteen institutions throughout the U.S. and Europe.  In                  addition to faculty from the University of Minnesota, the Center                will involve participants from Brigham Young, Cornell, Courant                  Institute, Harvard, Princeton, Rutgers, SUNY Stony Brook,                       University of California, San Diego, as well as Ecole Normale                   Superieur, Paris, the University of Warwick, and AT&T Bell                      Laboratories.  Under the aegis of the Geometry Supercomputer                    Project at Minnesota, these researchers have been collaborating for             the past three years.  Through this collaboration they have                     demonstrated their ability to make such a distributed Center                    function.                                                                                                                                                       The subject of mathematics, an extremely rich and varied territory,             has had a tendency to fragment into many subdisciplines, with                   little communication between them, or their closely related fields,             such as computer science.  The goal of the Center is to tie these               differently perceived fields together under the unifying topic of               geometry and geometric representation on the computer.  The                     Center's scientific program is based on a core of scientific                    investigations whose origins are in \"pure\" mathematics as well as               models of physical phenomenon.  It is organized into five groups:               topology; geometry and symmetry dynamics; geometric optimization;               computation, geometry and graphics; and fractal geometry.  The                  proposed research includes a range of high-level mathematics                    centered on geometry utilizing high-level computer science centered             on geometry, in the environment of a high-quality laboratory for                computation, graphics, and visualization.  Through the common                   thread of visualization, the research forms a coherent body.                                                                                                    The Center will provide leadership in typing diverse fields of                  mathematics and computer science together and will facilitate                   knowledge transfer between fields.  In addition, the solutions of               some of the proposed problems will require the development of                   software tools that could reach beyond the basic mathematical areas             involved and have important applications to research in other                   scientific fields, such as molecular biology, where visualization               modeling are essential.                                                                                                                                         This Center will stimulate enhanced activity in precollege                      education and in the development of human resource.//",
