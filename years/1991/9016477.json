This program may                    serve as a model for future programs to be considered by the                    National Science Foundation (NSF).  This project includes a of                  undergraduate and graduate level international engineering                      exchange and research program between the Mechanical                            Engineering and Chemical Engineering Departments at Michigan                    State University (MSU) and the technical universities                           (Rheinisch Westfalische Hochschule (RWTH) in Aachen, Germany                    and the University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germay.                                                                                                                                                                                   The project supports an international engineering exchange                      program within the National Science Foundation- enhancing NSF                   efforts in the direction of mechanical and chemical                             engineering.  This project represents an opportunity to invest                  in the up-grading of an established program with an unusually                   strong balance between instruction and research components                      that goes beyond the traditional research-only or intstuction-                  only exchange programs.                                                                                                                                         NSF support is provided for a three-phase program.  Phase I                     involves strengthening the undergraduate component of an                        existing program.  Phase II encourages and involves short                       term collaborative research projects which will explore and                     develop the bases for long-term, in-depth collaborative                         research projects involving MSU and faculty at Aachen and                       Kaiserslautern.  Successful Phase II projects will be used as                   the basis for submitting regular research proposals for Phase                   III funding which will support multi-year, full-scale                           collaborative research projects.  It is anticipated that                        German academies will also seek appropriate support from their                                                                                                  indigenous funding sources for these efforts.                                                                                                                   In a supplementary portion of this project, the program will                    provide partial support for initiating the development and                      implementation of a few engineering courses taught in German                    at Michigan State University, and some faculty support to                       administration and further develop this program.",
