 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr.                     Mohsen Sultan of the California Department of Transportation                    (Caltrans) to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Kazuhiko                  Kawashima for 12 months at the Public Works Research Institute                  in Japan.  They will conduct research on seismic design                         methods of highway bridges, comparing the California and                        Japanese methods.                                                                                                                                               Since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the importance of                        accurate prediction of structures' behavior during large                        magnitude earthquakes has been reemphasized.  An expert in                      bridge design and Project Manager of the  Division of                           Structures, Caltrans, Dr. Sultan investigated the structural                    damage caused by the 1989 earthquake as a member of the                         Caltrans Post Earthquake Investigation Team.  Dr. Sultan's                      expertise in the ductility method in seismic design will                        complement Dr. Kawashima's expertise in a seismic design                        method of rigid foundations as they compare designs of                          several bridges.  Yielding a much better understanding of the                   differences between the two systems, the research will help                     in retrofitting existing bridges, in designing new bridge                       projects, such as a long span bridge to cross the Carquinez                     Straight, and in evaluating the seismic safety of existing                      bridges such as the San Francisco Bay Bridge.",
