 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethical studies in technical communication underscore the importance            of teaching students about effective communication, but much teaching           material uses hypothetical case studies to demonstrate ethical                  issues.  Historical research suggests that communication errors play            a major role in large-scale technological disasters, but                        rhetoricians have not studied actual documentation in detail.                   Preliminary research into mining disasters that were the subjects of            Congressional oversight suggests that problems in documentation,                guidelines and specifications contribute to disasters.  The                     evidence raises questions about the consequences of writing practice            and the use and interpretation of technical documents.  This study              will examine documentation in two disasters to (1) define categories            and functions of different kinds of documents affecting technological           development and management, (2) determine the codes and conventions             that govern the production of documents and allow management to use             and interpret them, (3) describe how writers select or exclude evidence         to accept, assign or avoid responsibility and determine how those               decisions affect disasters; (4) determine whether writers see their             role as observers, recording objective facts, or active problem                 solvers; (5) compare expert and non-expert testimony to understand              how agencies influence the production of texts; and (6) determine               the function of individual documents in influencing decisionmaking              about complex technologies.                                                                                                                                     The topic of this proposal is of high priority for Ethics and Values            Studies.  The qualifications and track record of the investigator               are good.  The project provides an important impetus to rhetorical              studies of technical writing in the development and management of               complex technologies.  Besides their utility for scholarship in                 this field, results will be useful for scientists, engineers,                   policy analysts, decisionmakers and citizens concerned about                    these issues.  They will also be useful in courses and curricula                in technical writing.  The proposal is recommended for support.",
