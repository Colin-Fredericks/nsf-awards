 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a three-day workshop on intelligent                     structural systems in Como, Italy toward the end of June                        1991.  The workshop is being organized by Professor Yi-Kwei                     Wen of the University of Illinois at Urbana and Professor                       Favio Casciati of the Universita di Pavia, Italy.  The                          objective of the workshop/seminar is to review progress to                      date and propose directions for further research in various                     areas including the utilization of knowledge-based expert                       systems for the monitoring, control and assessment of                           structural systems.  The main thrust will be on the utilization                 of recent analytical/numerical methods, high-tech hardware,                     and expert systems to ensure better performance of existing                     and next generation structural systems.                                                                                                                         Construction (including buildings and structures and other                      civil works) is probably the largest industry in the world.                     Recent reports indicate that the investment in this area                        amounts to 10% of the world's gross domestic product.                           Structures generally have longer service life, and are not as                   easily replaced compared with any other kinds of commercial                     products.  Yet technology to monitor and maintain the health                    of the buildings and structural systems has been practically                    non-existent compared with other major commercial products such                 as automobiles.  There have been recent developments in the                     areas of analytical/numerical modeling and response analysis                    of structural systems under loadings, including the effect of                   uncertainty in both loading and resistance.  At the same                        time, new technologies and hardware have been invented that                     make real time sensing, monitoring, assessment and control of                   structural systems possible and feasible.  By exchanging                        information and promoting the introduction of new ideas and                     concepts, this workshop has the potential to lead to new                        developments, applications and implementation of existing                       technologies.",
