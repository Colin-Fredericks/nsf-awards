 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of                      Minnesota, Institute of Technology has a program of summer research             in mechanical engineering for science and engineering                           undergraduates.  Fifteen students (seven from ME, eight from other              schools) participate in the program.  Applicants for the program                are asked to submit transcripts, letters of recommendation, and an              essay.  Participants are selected by a panel of faculty members.                The program starts with an orientation in which research projects               and facilities are described.  Participants are asked to select a               project on which to work from a group of twenty ongoing research                programs in Mechanical Engineering.  A faculty supervisor monitors              the progress of each student.  Students are given increasing                    responsibilities as their skills develop.  Students are asked to                attend biweekly seminars which explore current research areas in                Mechanical Engineering.  The students live on campus in dormitories             close to one another so that they may share their research                      experiences.  An informal social program is organized.  At the end              of the summer, students are asked to prepare oral and written                   reports on their research activities.  An attempt is made to find               on-campus research jobs for students who do well in the program.",
