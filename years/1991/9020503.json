 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis and characterization of non-hydrolyzable C-glycoside              analogs of 5-phoshorylribose 1 .-diphosphate (PRPP) determined that             they are competent competitive inhibitors of orotate                            phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) and that they cannot serve as                substrates.  This allows the use of these compounds to assess the               thermodynamics of ternary complex formation in the PRTases,                     previously an untenable experiment because no analogs were                      available that could resist cleavage at the anomeric carbon.  This              proposal also involves preparation of another novel 3,5 cyclic                  phosphate analog of PRPP in order to test the hypothesis that yeast             orotate PRTase changes its mechanism by swinging the 5-phosphate                over or away from the 1-carbon of PRPP.  This presumed \"change in               mechanism\"  can also be investigated by inversion transfer                      experiments using 31P NMR; these proposed studies would characterize            the dynamics between PRPP and PPi (or PRPCP and methylene                       bisphosphonate) in the first \"half reaction\" of orotate PRTase that             might bind a 5-phosphorylribose oxocarbocation intermediate.  The               apparent \"change in mechanism\" may result from a competition in                 rate between the release of PPi and binding or orotate; this                    possibility will be studied.  Also included is the evaluation of                the likely role of the putative oxocarbocation intermediate by                  testing various analogs, (derivatives of O-phosphorylprolinol) of               the intermediate on the enzyme.  These studies should shed light                on the general mechanism of nucleotide synthesis.",
