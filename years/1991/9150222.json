 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the 1980s the analog videodisc provided a means for                          interactivity in multimedia instruction.  However, the video                    images remained in an analog form so that their use was limited                 to images or part of images as they were recorded and simple                    graphics placed on the video.                                                                                                                                   The development of digital video stored on a compact disk has                   changed that situation.  One can now obtain video images which                  are stored in digital form, played in real time, and manipulated                by a computer as computer graphics are.  The digital video format               provides a full range of possibilities, including the combination               of different scenes and the changing of parts of a scene, to                    create images which realistically appear and which respond to                   student needs.                                                                                                                                                  The proposed project will combine digital video with up-to-date                 software techniques, research on student learning of physics, and               information about reaching diverse audiences.  Instructional                    models, paradigms, and materials will be developed for the                      teaching of modern physics.  These materials will address issues                of teaching difficult and abstract concepts by enabling students                to make connections between their \"real\" (Macroscopic) world and                the world of the very small or very high speeds.  By using                      software and the manipulation of digital video images the system                will be able to make gradual changes from the students' everyday                experiences to the physicists' models.  Because the students will               have control of the changes and the rate at which they are made,                they will also control their own learning.  In this way the                     digital video learning platform will demonstrate how this                       technology can open new possibilities for the teaching of                       science.",
