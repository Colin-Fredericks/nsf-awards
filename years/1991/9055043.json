 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Chemical Society (ACS) requests funds to support a                 two-year Young Scholars program involving twenty-five secondary                 school students each year at the following institutions, chosen                 for their accessibility to high-ability, minority students:                     Drury College, Northern Arizona University, Montana College of                  Mineral Science and Technology, the University of Texas at El                   Paso, and Florida International University.  Five students will                 attend the program at each university each summer; therefore a                  total of fifty students will be involved over the two-year                      period.                                                                                                                                                         The program will consist of an eight-week summer chemical                       research experience for the students, providing a comprehensive                 experience in scientific research that also includes instruction                in scientific methods and an exploration of scientific ethics.                  Research chemists will serve as role models for the students,                   encouraging them to pursue careers in chemistry or related                      sciences.                                                                                                                                                       Follow-up programs will involve students and preceptors traveling               to an ACS Regional Meeting or the annual meeting of the Society                 for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science                 and presenting their work during a poster session, as well as                   monthly meetings of the students and preceptors, either on                      Saturdays or after school.",
