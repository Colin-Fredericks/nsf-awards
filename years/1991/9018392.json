 "awd_abstract_narration": "This long-term study focuses on the ecological disturbances                to eastern Pacific coral reefs that accompanied the severe and                  historically unprecedented 1982-83 ENSO (El Nino-Southern                       Oscillation) event. During the first 3-year segment (1985-87) of                the study a strong causative link was established between                       prolonged sea warming and numerous kinds of primary disturbances.               During the first and second 3-year (1988-90) study periods the                  team of workers involved in this study have (a) demonstrated the                importance of several secondary (long-term) disturbance                         processes, (b) revealed the extent of recovery and continuing                   reef destruction to date, and (c) provided some indication of the               frequency of severe El Nino disturbances to coral reefs in an                   historical context. Because some important secondary                            disturbances are still occurring, and reef recovery has been slow               (Costa Rica, Panama) or non-existent (Galapagos Islands), it is                 necessary to continue with this study in order to understand the                variety of changes involved and the full impact of a major                      disturbance on coral reef survival and the potential for                        continued reef building. ENSO warming disturbances can provide                  some clues to the probable changes in coral reefs worldwide if                  global warming causes repeated and/or protracted sea temperature                increases comparable to the 1982-83 El Nino event.",
