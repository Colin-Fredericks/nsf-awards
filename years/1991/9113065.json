 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use meta-analysis to synthesize the                      results of independent ecological studies.  Meta-analysis is a                  statistical approach that has had a profound impact on the                      resolution of longstanding questions in other fields, but has not               previously been used in ecology.  The research will extend                      existing meta-analysis techniques taken from the social sciences                and epidemiology to analyze ecological data and to address                      ecological questions.  Methods currently used to synthesize                     research results in ecology are logically, conceptually, and                    statistically flawed.  Meta-analysis offers a sounder                           alternative, but the statistical models available are inadequate                for many important tasks in ecology, such as examining                          interactions among factors.  The proposed study will develop                    meta-analytic statistical models from ecological research (mixed                models and factorial designs).  These models will then be used to               resolve a specific question, that of the effects of competition                 in the presence and in the absence of predators.  Meta-analysis                 can potentially change the way conclusions are drawn from the                   outcome of experiments in ecology, and may have a major influence               on the way data are collected, analyzed and interpreted in this                 field.",
