 "awd_abstract_narration": "Luteinizing hormone (LH) is produced by the anterior pituitary                  gland and acts to stimulate steroid production by the gonads of                 both males and females.  Among the hormones known to exist, LH has              one of the more complex chemical structures because it contains two             dissimilar peptide chains and because each of these peptide chains              has attached sugars.  During the synthesis of this hormone, some                of the sugar portions of the molecules are altered giving them                  different amounts of molecular charge.  Thus, rather than existing              as a single molecular entity, luteinizing hormone exists as a                   family of closely related molecular forms.  Previous research has               demonstrated that the distribution of LH among these identifiable               molecular forms can be changed by hypothalamic and gonadal hormones             which act at the anterior pituitary gland to regulate the secretion             of luteinizing hormone.  Research to be performed will address the              major question:  \"Does the fact that luteinizing hormone exists as              a family of identifiable molecular components play a significant                role in regulating the reproductive processes of animals?\"  In                  order to answer this question, sheep will be used as the                        experimental model because they have relatively large pituitry                  glands from which these distinct molecular forms can be purified.               Once these are purified, their chemical structures will be                      obtained.  In addition, the biological functions of selected                    molecular forms of luteinizing hormone will be examined by                      determining their ability to survive into circulation,by examining              their ability to stimulate gonadal target cells in vitro and by                 examining their ability to stimulate gonadal target cells in intact             animals.  This research should reveal whether the subtle changes                which occur in the molecular structure of ovine LH play a                       significant and meaningful role in the regulation of reproductive               function.//",
