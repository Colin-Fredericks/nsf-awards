 "awd_abstract_narration": "Th3 department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier Transform                   Infrared (FT-IR) Spectrophotometer for use throughout the                       undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  The instrument is enabling                 undergraduates to study theoretical and instrumental aspects of                 infrared spectroscopy as well as data analysis concepts.                        Advanced students are cooperatively developing new experiments                  with the faculty and undertaking independent research projects                  with the aid of the new equipment.The FT-IR spectrometers and                   associated work-stations will allow a full compliment of modern                 spectroscopic training to be offered to Viterbo students.  Not                  only will relevant technical expertise be gained by our                         chemistry, biology and pre-professional students but important                  knowledge about one of the most powerful analytical techniques                  will be gained by our non-science students.  This experience,                   combined with a strong curriculum, will keep our students                       competitive for future work in industrial/government                            laboratories, teaching or graduate school.",
