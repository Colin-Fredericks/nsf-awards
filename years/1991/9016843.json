 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation is part of GLOBEC - Global Ocean                        Ecosystems Dynamics - of the U.S. Global Chenage Research                       Program.  It is aimed at quantification of the interrelation                    between plankton trophodynamics and turbulence.  This project                   stems from the fact that the literature assumes that                            trophodynamics and consequent population dynamics depend only on                the relative density of predator and prey organisms, yet growing                theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that turbulence can                alter the contact rate.  Using a supercomputer, turbulence can be               simulated directly from the Navier-Stokes equation (DNS) so the                 simulated field is a \"real\" flow.  Flow visualization at the                    scale of an individual planktonic organism is the best way to                   educate our scientific mind.  Accumulated oceanic turbulence                    measurements provide enough information to interpret the                        numerically simulated turbulence as oceanic turbulent flow.  A                  lognormal probability density function will be used to model the                statistics of turbulent flow around a planktonic organism.                           A computer program will be developed to reduce the amount of               computation required for DNS.  This program will create a                       kinematically correct random flow field at a high Reynolds                      number, which is unavailable from DNS.  A data base will be                     established for the simulated flow field for later uses.  A                     potential use of this data base will be to test the notion of                   food/ingestion signals.                                                              A stochastic model will be employed to model the behavior of               a planktonic organism.  Currently random walk is the only model                 used in Lagrangian simulations, however, the organism shows much                more complex swimming behavior.  A modified Auto-Regressive model               will be adapted for this purpose.",
