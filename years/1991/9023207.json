 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental regulation of gene expression is certain to be                    critical for the survival and success of marine organisms.  At                  present, however, very little is known about the interactions                   between environmental factors, e.g., temperature, and the                       regulation of transcription of genes in any marine eucaryotic                   organism.  The only well understood example of environmental                    control of gene expression is in the case of the heat shock                     proteins (HSPs), which are induced by high temperature and other                stresses (e.g., anoxia) in all organisms so far studied. However,               few marine species have been examined. This project will examine                the heat shock gene (HSP) system in several species of                          differently thermally-adapted marine animals to determine: (i)                  the threshold temperatures at which heat stress (HSP induction)                 takes place in differently adapted species (or populations), (ii)               the induction patterns of HSPs in larval and adult individuals of               coastal fishes, and (iii) the underlying molecular bases of the                 inter-specific (or inter-population) differences in HSP                         expression.  Particular attention will be given to congeneric                   species inhabiting different thermal regimes, e.g., latitudinally               separated species of two genera of fish, Sebastes and Embiotoca,                the mussel Mytilus, and to various fishes whose larval stages                   inhabit potentially warm bays and estuaries.  The goals of these                studies include (i) the development of a powerful molecular index               for gauging environmental stress; (ii) the discovery of basic                   mechanisms of thermal tolerance, and (iii) the elucidation of                   evolutionary differences in the HSP regulatory mechanisms, which                set the differences in induction temperatures in differently-                   adapted species.  HSP induction  temperatures may provide                       important insights into the thermal tolerance of different                      species and populations, i.e., into the fundamental molecular                   basis for biogeographical distribution patterns.  The development               of a relatively simple screening method for HSP in invertebrates,               could provide a useful method for gauging the level of stress                   experienced by natural populations of marine organisms.",
