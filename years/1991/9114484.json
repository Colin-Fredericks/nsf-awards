 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research project is to develop and evaluate                a prototype autonomous grinding system for cylindrical plunge                   grinding.  The system will adjust the operating parameters of the               cycle from part to part to reduce cycle time while satisfying part-             quality constraints in response to in-process and post-process                  measurements which characterize the processing conditions and part              quality.  In order to cope with quantitative uncertainty of the                 process, the cycle time reduction methodology will employ if-then               rules derived from a simulation of the grinding process.  Only two              in-process sensors will be used, a power monitor and a size gage,               which can withstand a harsh production environment.  It is shown                that information derived from these sensors, together with                      post-process measurement (inspection) of part quality (i.e.,                    finish and roundness), can be used to characterize the state of the             grinding process through process models.  The cycle time reduction              methodology will be designed and evaluated in simulation.                       Practical implementation and testing of the autonomous system will              be on a commercial internal grinder, retrofitted with electrical                drives and sensors and interfaced to a personal computer for data               acquisition, system identification, and machine control.                             The result of this investigation will provide the scientific               and technological basis for commercial development of a new                     generation of grinding systems as well as retrofitting (upgrading)              of older grinders.",
