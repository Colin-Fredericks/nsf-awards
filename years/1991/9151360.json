 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the                    University of Alabama in Huntsville has initiated the                           development of a comprehensive laboratory which provides                        \"hands-on\" education in digital signal processing, control,                     robotics, and communications.  Two adjacent and identical rooms                 with an area of 1500 square ft.  are provided for this lab.                     There are 12 workstations in each room.  The main components of                 these workstations are: TMS320C30 DSP Evaluation Board, an IBM                  386/25 MHz computer, DSP hardware and software development                      systems.  The TMS320C30 DSP is a high performance 32 bit                        floating-point device in the TMS32O family of single-chip DSPs.                 The 60-ns cycle time of the TM5320C30 allows it to execute                      operations at a performance rate up to 33 MFLOPS with parallel                  multiply and ALU operations on both integer and floating-point                  data in a single cycle.  The TMS320C30 real-time performance                    offer flexible design approach in a variety of applications.                    At the junior level, students are introduced to the                             implementation of basic DSP algorithms such as sampling                         techniques, convolution, correlation, and fast Fourier                          transforms using the TMS320C30 Evaluation Board.  At the senior                 level, students apply these tools to implement design projects                  in the areas of control, robotics, or communications.",
