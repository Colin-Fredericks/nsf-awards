 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will seek to understand the dynamics of the Cuban                  upper class as a central factor in the origins of the 1959                      revolution.  Upper class failure to coalesce class alliances,                   direct state policies, and define relations with the United                     States is a much neglected dimension of how radical revolution                  was possible in Cuba.  The study of Cuba has been largely                       marginal to the literatures on Latin America development and                    revolutions.  It is hoped to integrate Cuba into these                          literatures by focusing on the Cuban upper class and society                    before 1959.  The study will be delimited by 1868 and 1960 for                  two reasons.  The struggle for national independence is central                 to the Cuban historical experience and the first war against                    Spain began in 1868.  The sugar industry is likewise central                    to Cuban development and its more capital-intensive                             transformation occurred after 1868.  How the upper class (sugar                 and non-sugar) related to other classes, the state, and                         economic development is crucial for the processes of class                      formation and state-building before 1959.  The origins of the                   revolution need to be placed within the dynamics of the society                 that failed to sustain capitalism--not in some notion of                        \"betrayal\" by Fidel Castro once in power.  The study will be                    closed in 1960 when the old order unraveled.                                      The study will examine one country in Latin America that has                  served as a model of development, both theoretically within the                 dependency literature and empirically with the high quality-                    of-life indicators, and contribute to understanding of how                      social class coalitions and state interventions interact to                     produce eventual revolutionary outcomes.  Results will be used                  by those trying to synthesize and reconstruct explanations of                   Third World (and particularly Latin American) order and                         breakdown politically.  The project furthers VPW program                        objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance their                  careers in science or engineering through research, and to                      encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas through                  the investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the                    host campuses.  In this project, the proposed activities which                  contribute to the second objective include:  teaching a seminar                 on Latin America revolutions (Mexico, Bolivia, Cuba,                            Nicaragua); attending two advance research seminars (on Latin                   American and state formation and collective action); and                        coordinating the monthly Latin American colloquium at the                       Center for Studies of Social Change.",
