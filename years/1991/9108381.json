The objective is to develop, in the context of a single                         theoretical framework, an explanatory account of certain                        syntactic and semantic phenomena characteristic of this important               linguistic type.  The theoretical framework of the project is a                 combination of the Government and Binding theory and a version of               model-theoretic semantics.  The research on the four languages                  systematically examines the ergative construction in relation to                each of the principal levels of syntactic representation--Logical               Form, S-structure, and D-structure--and in relation to the                      phenomenon of free word order, characteristic of the languages of               the project.  While the four language are reasonably                            representative of their type, the sample is restricted, and the                 project seeks to off-set this by incorporating three ancillary                  activities: a survey of the literature on Mayan ergativity                      (represented in agreement morphology only, rather than case), a                 semester-long seminar on ergativity, and a colloquium series on                 ergativity.  A book on the theoretical position of                              morphologically ergative languages is included as an integral                   part of the project.",
