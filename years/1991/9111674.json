 "awd_abstract_narration": "The reunification of East and West Germany has brought back                     together two political cultures which had grown rapidly apart                   during the preceding forty years.  The dramatic rejoining of                    political cultures provides a rare opportunity to assess the                    effects of the different political institutions of east and west                on the divergent development of their political cultures.  It also              facilitates analyses of the development of a new and democratic                 political culture among German youth who grew up in the east.  Of               particular interest is the development in these youth of attitudes              toward democracy and of democratic citizenship.                                                                                                                 This award contributes to the support of the first wave of a                    national survey of the political attitudes and beliefs of 3500                  German youth drawn from both east and west.  The study builds on                a long tradition of research on attitudes toward democracy but                  provides the first opportunity to study intensively and in a                    controlled setting how political attitudes develop in response to               different political environments.  In addition to providing                     systematic evidence of the effects of the East and West German                  political systems on citizen's attitudes, this study will provide               important baseline data for tracing changes in the political                    attitudes of East German youth as they become reintegrated into a               united democratic Germany.                                                                                                                                      When completed this study will provide a better understanding of                the attitudinal underpinnings of democracy and of the prospects for             developing democratic values in formerly authoritarian states.",
