 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on the further development of organo-                  group IV metal (Zr and Ti) mediated cyclization and                             cycloaddition reactions which have been discovered in the PI's                  laboratory. Application of this new methodology will be                         showcased by the synthesis of selected natural products                         including securinega alkaloids via zirconocene promoted                         heteroannulations, the lycora ring system via a zirconocene                     promoted reductive cyclization, 9(0)-methanoprostacyclin and                    methano PGI-1 via a zirconium complex and related cyclizations,                 and pyrrolidine and piperidine alkaloids via the intramolecular                 imidotitanium \u01312+2! cycloaddition reaction. These target                        molecules have been deliberately selected so that the crucial                   issues of stereo-, regio-, and chemocontrol associated with                     group IV mediated coupling processes can be thoroughly                          evaluated. In this way, the utility of these new reactions for                  performing operationally practical chemical syntheses will be                   demonstated.                                                                                                                                                    %%%                                                                                                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                  Division will support the research of Dr. Tom Livinghouse of                    the Department of Chemistry at Montana State University. The                    research is in the general area of synthetic methodology and                    its application to natural products synthesis. The focus will                   be on the use of organometallic systems containing titanium or                  zirconium as templates for the actualization of chemical                        reactions which would be otherwise impossible. These new                        reactions will be used to synthesize a number of natural                        products whose structures have been deliberately selected so                    that the crucial issues of stereo-, regio-, and chemocontrol                    associated with these organometallic mediated processes can be                  thoroughly evaluated. In this way, the utility of these new                     reactions for performing operationally practical chemical                       syntheses will be demonstrated.",
