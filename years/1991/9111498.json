 "awd_abstract_narration": "One objective of population biology is to understand how the               environment leads to differences among species; another is to                   explore the behavioral and physiological mechanisms that control                life history traits of individual species.  This research is                    designed to contribute to this basic knowledge by studying how                  hormones shape and direct the life of a small bird, the dark-eyed               junco.  The focus is one males and the hormone testosterone,                    which is known to have numerous effects on animal behavior,                     physiology, and morphology (shape and form).  These effects                     include a suppressive effect of testosterone on male parental                   behavior and a stimulatory effect on behavior related to mate                   attraction, e.g. singing.  Testosterone can also decrease                       resistance to disease.  By manipulating the amount of                           testosterone in the blood and comparing the behavior and                        physiology of the treated birds to that of untreated, control                   birds, the changes induced will be examined and related to                      correlated of fitness, such as ability to sire offspring, life                  span, and survival of offspring.  The birds will be studied in                  the field where their survival and success in producing offspring               can be monitored.  By tracking the fates of animals whose                       physiology and behavior deviates from the normative state, the                  research will lead to a more fundamental understanding of how                   hormonal systems evolve and what balance of selective factors and               organismal responses keeps a particular animal species \"on                      track\" over evolutionary time.",
