 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program on the use of semiconductor                               microstructures as optical waveguides involves                                  methods that are computationally intensive.  The                                Engineering Research Equipment Grant will provide                               a workstation with the computational facility needed                            to carry out this work.  The goal of this project is to                         determine the characteristics of new, novel integrated                          electro-optic devices.                                                                                                                                          The PI will propose to investigate a new, developing                            research area focused on quantum well                                           microstructure optical waveguides (QWOWG).                                      Briefly, QWOWG is defined as an optical waveguide                               with quantum well (QW) boundaries, confining                                    mobile charge, on the boundary or the vicinity of a                             guiding structure, modifying the propagation                                    characteristics of the structure.  Such modified                                propagation characteristics will be analyzed in the                             studies.  Moreover, with electron-wave tunneling                                between QWs, excitation of higher QW subbands, and                              electromagnetic Floquet modes due to QW periodic                                patterns, such structures have ample mechanisms for                             anomalies.  It is these anomalies that may prove                                useful for new devices.                                                                                                                                         Two dimensional (2D) and/or three dimensional                                   (3D) QWs are represented in any of a variety of                                 planar patterns in terms of a frequency and spatially                           dependent nonlocal complex conductivity, o.  QW                                 conductivity calculations, will be carried out in terms                         of quantum-mechanical linear-response theory,                                   employing a Schroedinger Green's function                                       formulation as appropriate.                                                                                                                                     Determination of the propagation characteristics of                             QW microstructure waveguides involves extensive                                 computation using a modified form of the spectral                               domain method (SDM).  In the PI's treatment using                               this technique, a surface current vector field of                               arbitrary strength serves to represent the QW                                   pattern.",
