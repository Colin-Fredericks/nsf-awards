 "awd_abstract_narration": "An instrument-based environmental laboratory course entitled:                   ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS ANALYSIS will be developed in this project.               It is a core course to be offered by the newly established                      Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) program in Environmental                      Systems.  This new BAS program provided the students with an                    understanding of the techniques for quantitative description on                 environmental phenomena, the technologies for environmental                     control, and the laboratory skill for environmental analysis.                   The proposed course will achieve the last objective of the                      program.  It will be offered to upper level undergraduates.                     A key element in the course is the experiments to be performed by               students that directly relate to the topics covered in two other                core courses: one deals with treatment technologies for                         environmental control, and the other deals with mathematical                    modeling of environmental systems.  Meanwhile, students will                    learn to operate modern laboratory instruments/equipment through                classroom lectures (2 hrs/week) and hand-on laboratory exercises                (3 hrs/week).  This represents a significant departure from                     traditional environmental laboratory courses, which tend to only                emphasize laboratory skills,  Student will perform eight                        experiments in this course.  In addition, a laboratory safety                   session will be offered prior to laboratory experiments to equip                students with necessary knowledge for safety precaution and                     hazard prevention.  The materials covered will be suitable for a                one-semester course.                                                                                                                                            The instruments/equipment requested will be suitable to                         accommodate for up to 20 students in a class.  The                              instrument/equipment requested will allow student to perform                    reliable and accurate experiments thereby maximizing the benefits               offered by such a course.  Results and experience obtained                      through development of this course will be disseminated via                     publications of journal articles and presentations at                           conferences. Ultimately, a monograph on the subject will be                     published.",
