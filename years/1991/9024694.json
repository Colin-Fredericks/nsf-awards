 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in theoretical                   physics between Dr. Ronald Bieniek, University of Missouri at                   Rolla, and two British scientists:  Dr. Keith Burnett,                          Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford University and Dr. Mark Child,                     Theoretical Chemistry Department, Oxford University.  The                       proposed study is aimed at developing accurate semiclassical                    models and methods of describing and analyzing collisional                      and half-collisional redistribution of polarized radiation.                                                                                                     When polarized light is absorbed during a close atomic/molec-                   ular full- or half-collision, the fragments will flouresce                      light after they separate.  The degree of polarization                          remaining in the light, as a function of laser detuning,                        contains much information about intermolecular potentials and                   the fundamental transition from molecular to atomic domains.                    The analysis of experimental information about properties is                    greatly facilitated if accurate and tractable theoretical                       tools are available with which investigators can visualize                      the phenomena and describe the underlying physics.  Semiclassi-                 cal techniques, which treat some aspects in a classical way                     and others in a quantum mechanical manner, can offer                            considerable insight.  However, current semiclassical methods                   for redistribution are, in many ways, unsatisfactory.  This                     project is designed to improve this situation by enhancing                      the popular locking/decoupling model, and developing new                        techniques to deal with phase interference effects between                      excitation events, Coriolis braking of orbital rotation, and                    the vagaries of the boundary between the atomic and the                         molecular coupling of angular momenta.  The British collabora-                  tors involved are at the forefront of redistribution research                   and the US investigator Dr. Bieniek will benefit greatly from                   the opportunity to carry out this long term research visit.",
