 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in population                    biology and ecology between Dr. Philip Crowley, University of                   Kentucky, and Dr. J.H. Lawton, Center for Population Biology,                   Imperial College at Silwood Park, Ascot, Berkshire, England.                    The proposed study will focus on two areas:                                     l)  the possible tendency for the abundances of individual                      populations or of groups of populations to stabilize, and on                    how best to detect, measure and conceptualize this stabiliza-                   tion process, and 2) the possibility that being sufficiently                    spread out in space or fragmented into partially connected                      sub-populations can reduce population variability and the risk                  of extinction.                                                                                                                                                  The proposed projects represent attempts to facilitate the                      convergence of theory and data concerning the stability and                     persistence of natural populations.  Among the specific                         objectives of each project are:                                                 1) Density-Dependence and Stability: to devise and improve                      statistically defensible and sensitive techniques for                           detecting density-dependence in density sequences for                           individual populations and 2) Metapopulation Stability and                      Persistence: to consider models of populations that consist                     of quasi-independent parts weakly linked by dispersal and                       buffeted by moderate environmental fluctuations and to                          conduct laboratory tests of the models' predictions.  The                       issues addressed in the proposed research are of fundamental                    importance in population and community ecology.  Though                         difficult to document empirically, density dependence is                        central to our understanding of how populations are regulated.                  Moreover, understanding persistence and measuring stability                     are becoming increasingly critical in an era of human-induced                   ecological stress and global climatic change. The Center for                    Population Biology at Silwood Park provides an outstanding                      environment for collaborative research in population dynamics.                  The expertise of Dr. Crowley and his British collaborators is                   complementary, and should serve to enhance the proposed                         research.",
