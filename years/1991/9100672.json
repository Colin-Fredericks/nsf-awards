 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this procurement are two-fold.  First,                   the contractor is to perform all functions associated with the                  conduct and data processing of the annual Survey of Scientific                  and Engineering Expenditures at Universities and Colleges.  The                 contractor will also provide technical support for analytical,                  descriptive, and comparative purposes for data maintained in                    the system.  Second, the contractor will provide maintenance                    support of the academic Integrated Data Base (IDB).  The IDB                    includes the survey mentioned above and as well as additional                   academic surveys conducted under separate contracts within the                  Division of Science Resources Studies.  As part of the IDB                      task, the contractor will produce summaries of institutional                    data, as well as perform systematic edit checks across surveys                  to assess the relationship of financial and personnel resources                 and the validity of the data as reported.                                            As part of its statutory charge to provide a central                       clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, and analysis                  of data on the current and projected availability of scientific                 and technical resources in the United States, NSF collects and                  disseminates statistical data on detailed characteristics of                    science and engineering resources in colleges and universities.                 The annual survey that is the subject of this study as well as                  other academic surveys in the IDB provide statistical data and                  analytical reports for dissemination to users including                         internal NSF management and the National Science Board, other                   science and technology policy makers, institutional                             researchers, and private organizations interested in higher                     education.",
