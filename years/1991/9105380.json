 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to examine long-distance virus                   movement in plants in order to obtain a better understanding of                 plant virus resistance.  In the past few years, virus movement                  studies have centered around the role of virus-encoded factors in               cell to cell movement.  This proposal focusses on host factors                  which are involved in cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) movement in               Arabidopsis plants.  New techniques that will be used to follow                 virus movement include a whole plant in situ hybridization                      procedure and virus transactivation of a resident reporter gene.                These techniques will be used to examine different Arabidopsis                  ecotypes and screen for Arabidopsis mutants with resistance to                  virus infection and variation in patterns of long distance virus                movement.  Genes encoding movement traits will be cloned using map-             based cloning or deletion subtraction hybridization.                                                                                                            Insight into mechanisms involved in the movement of viruses in                  plants will suggest mechanisms for preventing such movement and                 thereby creating a virus resistant plant.***//",
