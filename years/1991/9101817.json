The principal investigator will develop a                   Riemann-Roch theorem for quantum manifolds through his work on                  the cyclic homology theory of quantum groups and spaces.                        Applications of these results to arithmetic and conformal                       quantum field theory will also be explored.                                          The research in this project is an outgrowth of calculus                   on manifolds.  Roughly speaking, manifolds are surfaces and                     their higher-dimensional analogues.  Differential operators,                    which come from calculus, see the manifold only in small                        pieces, but nevertheless contain information about its overall                  shape and conformation. One strategy for extracting this sort                   of information from differential operators involves assembling                  the operators into algebraic structures and then using                          algebraic machinery.  This project is concerned with the                        development of this machinery.",
