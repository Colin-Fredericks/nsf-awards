 "awd_abstract_narration": "One feature of visual systems that is very important is                         detection of image motion.  Such motion may occur across the                    visual field, or have a component toward or away from the                       observer, called \"motion in depth.\"  To understand how the visual               system handles motion it is important to learn how nerve cells in               the complex network of the visual cortex respond physiologically                to moving stimuli, including selectivity to particular directions               or velocities of motion.                                                                                                                                        This project combines a mathematical modelling approach with                    physiological recording of single cortical neurons.  The intent                 is to obtain detailed functional information about connectivity                 in the visual pathway that cannot be obtained through other                     methods such as anatomical labelling or tissue culture.  Visual                 stimuli will be mainly those of a moving bar array which will be                modulated in space and time, using the principles of \"white                     noise\" to produce a randomized stimulus sequence.  One part of                  the study will test how velocity sensitivity may be modeled in                  cortical cells, and how it may suggest connectivity and cellular                mechanisms for that selectivity.  The other part will test                      selectivity for movement sensitivity in three dimensions,                       analyzing monocular and binocular responses to the stimulus                     components.  This powerful approach should give results that will               have an impact not only on visual neuroscience, but also on                     computer vision, artificial intelligence, and neural networks.",
