 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the proposed research is to study                    the structure and dynamics of chemisorption through He atom                     scattering on crystalline surfaces using the relatively new                     experimental technique, He atom-surface spectroscopy (HAS).                     Surfaces formed when a series of long-chained hydrocarbons,                     alkylthiols, are chemisorbed onto a gold (111) surface are to                   be examined.  The low energy He atoms, since they do not react                  with or charge the surface, are the probe of choice for these                   systems.                                                                          An understanding of the structure and dynamics of the                         surfaces to be studied has implications in many areas including                 catalysis, models for biological interfaces and membranes,                      corrosion protection, and adhesion problems.  The project                       furthers VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for                    women to advance their careers in science or engineering                        through research, and to encourage other women to pursue                        careers in these areas through the investigators' enhanced                      visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In this                        project, the proposed activities which contribute to the second                 objective include:  organizing a Garvin Medalist Symposium                      series of outstanding women chemists; serving as a guest                        lecturer in \"Science, Technology, and Society\" course; and                      interacting with the HAS research group, an interdisciplinary                   group, through daily research contact and formal seminar                        presentations.",
