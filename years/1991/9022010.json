It is argued that these formalisms allow for more                      succinct descriptions of linguistic phenomena than less powerful                grammars.  However, the enhanced power of these formalisms raises               important questions concerning their computational feasibility.                 Specifically:                                                                   (1)  How efficient can NL parsing be carried out for these                      powerful grammars?                                                              (2)  Can the purported succinctness gain when moving from a                     weaker to a more powerful grammar be quantified in precise                      mathematical terms?                                                                                                                                             The planned research is aimed at resolving these two questions.                 First, upper bounds on the complexity of parsing will be derived,               and the most efficient parsing algorithms, both serial and                      parallel, for different natural language grammars will be                       developed.  Secondly, a mathematical framework for comparing the                relative succinctness of different formalisms will be developed.                Using grammar size as a measure of descriptional complexity, the                gain in succinctness (if any) when moving from a weaker to a more               powerful will be quantified precisely.                                                                                                                          The results of this investigation will be useful in assessing the               practicability of building natural language processing systems                  based on powerful grammatical formalisms.",
