 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop a number of new techniques to facilitate the              genetic and molecular biological analysis of higher plants.  The                model organism is Arabidopsis and the model signal transduction                 pathway is the touch response pathway which results in a phenomenon             known as thigmomorphogenesis.  The technologies that we propose                 include:  (1) the development of inducible promoter systems, (2) a              method for conducting homologous DNA recombination for gene                     disruption, and (3) a negative selectable marker for use in the                 isolation of non-inducible mutants.  Several inducible promoters                which respond to exogenously added substances such as nitrate or                steroid (glucocorticoid, estrogen, etc.) will be developed. Systems             will be developed that allow induction in whole plants or in a                  specificly targeted tissue.  Using this system we will explore the              physiological consequences of the induction of a touch response                 gene, such as calmodulin.  Single or multiple combinations of genes             can be induced with this system.  We will also develop methods                  for gene disruption using homologous recombination.  The initial                investigation will target the tms2 gene; such disruption can be                 directly selected and should facilitate rapid assaying for                      homologous recombination.  This gene disruption system will be                  applied to the disruption of the touch response pathway genes.                  Since homozygous disruptions of these genes may be lethal we                    propose to place the genes under inducible promoter control.                    Physiological consequences can then be assessed by withdrawal of                the inducer.  We also propose to identify genes involved in the                 overall touch response pathway by fusing touch response promoters               to the tms2 gene for direct selection of non-inducible mutants.                                                                                                 Technique development has often made possible significant advances              in conceptual insights.***//",
