 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compounds that contain the electron-rich triple bond, usually                   dirhenium species, will be used as redox reagents.  A                           diphosphine bridging group will enable the redox potentials to                  be varied through substitution of groups within the ligand.                     Special emphasis will be placed on molecules having P-H and S-H                 bonds in order to assess the factors that influence the                         non-redox activity of these ligands versus their tendency to                    oxidatively add to the metal-metal bond.  The complexes will                    also be used as synthetic precursors to dirhenium polyhydrides,                 and the novel reactivity and structural chemistry of these                      hydrides will be examined.  The existence of stereochemical                     rigidity in 8-coordinate isomers of mononuclear rhenium                         polyhydride complexes will provide a unique opportunity to                      examine the importance of Re-Re versus Re-H-Re bonding in                       systems of a type that heretofore have only been found to                       exhibit fluxional behavior.                                                     %%%                                                                             In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                             Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Richard                   A. Walton of Purdue University will continue studies of                         dirhenium complexes that contain electron rich metal-metal                      bonds.  These compounds exhibit unusual reactivity and                          structures, and the results of this work will increase our                      basic knowledge of organometallic chemistry.  Potential                         applications of these studies include desulfurization of                        certain toxic molecules and the development of better catalysts                 for hydrogenation processes.",
