 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Clemson is enhancing                its established undergraduate research program through this summer              component.  The REU site involve students from Clemson and other                institutions in a ten week program of research, seminars, and                   workshops.  All of the activities challenge the participants                    intellectually and develop their critical thinking skills as well               as their ability to work independently.  The one-on-one contact                 with faculty and interaction with graduate students also introduce              these students to the opportunities in graduate education and the               career options in research and academia.  The Department of                     Mechanical Engineering has demonstrated its interest in                         undergraduate research through the established Senior Departmental              Honors program.  This program includes a research component and the             writing of a senior thesis.  Fifty percent of the faculty of the                department have participated in this program which spans the areas              of thermal and fluid science, mechanical and manufacturing systems,             engineering mechanics, and materials.  The summer program                       complements this existing program and provides opportunities for                a more diverse group of students.",
