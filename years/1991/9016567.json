 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for continuation of the Mid-Atlantic             Mass Spectroscopy Laboratory (MAMS) at Johns Hopkins University.                Funds provide support for the laboratory's collaborative research               activities, from which investigators at a number of institutions                benefit, for research training at the graduate and post-graduate                level, and for continued technique development activities.  Dr.                 Cotter is an outstanding young investigator known particularly for              his technique development activities, especially in use of time of              flight (TOF) and plasma desorption mass spectrometry.                           Collaborative projects include structural studies of lipids and                 composition of lipid membranes, structure function relationships                in enzymes and other proteins, and structures of oligosaccharide                side-chains on glycoproteins and glycolipids.                                       In the last decade or so, mass spectrometry (MS) has become a               technique of increasing usefulness to biologists and biochemists.               MS is of particular use in the analysis of lipids, of                           polysaccharides, of the types and sites of naturally occurring                  modifications of proteins, and of other aspects of protein                      structure including primary sequence.  Because of the expense of                their purchase and operation of the spectrometers, the disparate                types of biological problems for which MS is useful, and the real               but often infrequent need for MS in a given research project, mass              spectrometry is particularly suited for central facilities such as              MAMS that provide analyses for investigators at a number of                     institutions.  The focus on collaborative research insures that the             projects undertaken are not simply routine analyses, but instead                are challenging problems that help provide a suitable  environment              for continued development of MS techniques.",
