 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop and distribute a                      complete kit for starting and conducting an intervention                        program for high school students, particularly minorities                       and women, considering a career in science and mathematics.                     This kit, based on the San Antonio Prefreshman Engineering                      Program (PREP), will consist of curriculum materials and                        operational materials.  The textual materials will include                      modules in Logic and its Application to Mathematics, Problem                    Solving, Introduction to Engineering, Computer Science,                         Algebraic Structures, Introduction to Physics, Introduction                     to Technical Writing, and Introduction to Probability and                       Statistics--all of which are academic components in the                         first, second, or third year of PREP and were developed by                      the PREP writing teams.  These teams consist of college and                     high school teachers as well as some of the students who                        have gone through the PREP program.  The operational                            material will include program brochures, sample application                     forms, follow-up survey forms, and statistical table forms.                                                                                                     Copies of this material will be made available at cost to                       those organizations interested in starting such an                              intervention program.                                                                                                                                           There will be a two day workshop and a summer intern program                    to help those schools interested in such an intervention                        program.",
