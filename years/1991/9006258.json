 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine the origin of                     the support effect for supported vanadium oxide catalysts.                      Deposition of a two-dimensional vanadium-oxide overlayer on                     various oxide supports dramatically affects the reducibility,                   catalytic activity, and selectivity of the resultant surface                    phases.  The cause of this is not understood; possibilities                     include structural changes in the surface overlayer and                         electronic effects of the oxide support ligands.  Molecular                     structures of the surface vanadium-oxide overlayers are                         determined with a combination of laser Raman spectroscopy and                   solid-state vanadium-51 nuclear magnetic resonance.  Oxide                      supports chosen for this work are silica, niobia, zirconia,                     and magnesia; these display a wide range of acidity/basicity,                   electronegativity, and potential for ligand effects.  The                       reactivity of the catalysts is probed by temperature-                           programmed reduction and the structure-sensitive methanol                       oxidation reaction.                                                                                                                                             The improved understanding of this system should lead to                        better control and design of vanadia catalysts and of reactor                   systems employing such catalysts, or in which they may be                       formed inadvertently.  Such systems are receiving great                         attention as the method of choice for removal of nitrogen                       oxides (precursors of acid rain) from stationary sources.                       Other relevant processes include production of monomers for                     condensation polymers (polyesters, polyamides, etc.) synthetic                  sugars, and cracking and hydrotreating of petroleum.",
