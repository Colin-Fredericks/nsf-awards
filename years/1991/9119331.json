 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research, jointly supported by the Division of Cellular            Biosciences and the Division of Chemistry, is the continuation of an            interdisciplinary project to understand the action of juvenile hormone          at the molecular level combining the disciplines of chemistry,                  molecular biology, and physiology.  Major keys include understanding            the molecular basis for hormonal regulation of gene expression in               insects (L.M. Riddiford), biochemical and molecular studies of JH               metabolism and synthesis (B.D. Hammock), and use of high specific               activity labeled JHs and JHs (G.D. Prestwich).  Three benefits                  result from this project.  First, the scientific work is directed               at a fundamental problem in regulation of gene expression, and the              metamorphosis of insects in and easily accessible and fascinating               model system for this study.  Second, the practical implications                of this work may lead to the development of new biologically                    specific and environmentally safer insect control starategies for               crop pest.  Third, the interdiscriplinary training required for the             students postdoctoral fellow and faculty researchers involved                   enhances the quality and breadth of scientific inquiry in each                  laboratory.",
