 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                          Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, seeks to design                    and build novel instrumentation for Electron Spin Resonance                     (ESR) imaging.  Programmed phasing of radio frequency signal                    inputs rather than magnetic field gradients will be employed.                   Lower frequencies than are commonly employed for ESR                            spectrometry will also be employed, reducing the problems of                    sample heating.  If successful, this  Grant for Exploratory                     Research should lead to radically different ESR imaging                         instrumentation than would otherwise be available.                                                                                                              %%%                                                                                                                                                             Magnetic Resonance Imaging has profoundly improved diagnostic                   medicine.  Electron Spin Resonance imaging has not had the                      impact of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, due to instrumental as                    well as fundamental difficulties in generating signals.  In                     this research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                          Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, a novel means of                   generating electron spin images which may overcome several of                   the previously identified problems will be built and studied.                   This Grant for Exploratory Research is considered to be high                    risk, but the reward (the ability to routinely image free                       radicals in situ without roasting the object studied) makes the                 risk worthwhile.",
