 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to determine at what age and               with what underlying mechanism young infants perceive the visual                world as stable despite movements of the eyes, head, and body.                  Adults perceive the visual world as stable despite self-produced                movements primarily by means of reflexive eye movements triggered               by visual and vestibular stimulation.  These eye movements serve                to reduce or eliminate those movements of the retinal image that                are created by self-produced movements.  The vestibulo-ocular                   reflex (VOR), triggered by rotations or translations of the head,               counter-rolls the eyes in the direction opposite to head                        movement.  The optokinetic reflex (OKR) moves the eyes in the                   direction of retinal image movement.  These reflexes are                        supplemented by a fine-grained analysis of retinal image                        velocities located near the current direction of gaze and                       converted into eye movement signals for the smooth pursuit                      system.  In a typical visual environment with objects at many                   different distances, the observer must select a depth-plane for                 fixation and suppress those retinal image motions created by                    objects at nearer and farther distances.  When the visual scene                 moves, either because of object movement or movement of the                     observer, the three oculomotor systems -- VOR, OKR, and smooth                  pursuit -- are activated in concert to stabilize the attended                   object despite the movements of other retinal images.  These                    experiments will present 2- to 6-month-old human infants either                 with moving visual displays while they are held in a stable                     head/body position or with stationary visual displays while their               head/body is moved laterally.  The former condition stimulates                  the OKR and smooth pursuit systems, while the latter condition                  stimulates all three systems to reveal the role of the VOR.  At                 issue is how effectively infants are able to keep the object of                 attention stabilized on the retina despite movements of the                     visual surround and/or movements of the head/body.  Based on                    earlier work showing that smooth pursuit does not emerge until 2                months of age and depth perception does not emerge until 4 months               of age, Aslin predicts that if the smooth pursuit system is the                 critical factor, then effective stabilization should emerge at 2                months of age.  However, if segregation of objects in depth is                  the critical factor, then effective stabilization should not                    emerge until 4 months of age.  These results from normal infants                will provide a baseline for understanding the development of                    three oculomotor systems that are known to be essential for                     adults' perception of a stable visual world.",
