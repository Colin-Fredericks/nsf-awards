 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to New                 Mexico State University for the renovation and repair of the                    chemistry building which houses the research and research training              activities of the Department of Chemistry.  This building was                   constructed in 1957 and expanded by means of the addition of a new              wing in 1968.  The ARFMP grant of $200,000 and $200,000 provided by             the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these                     research and research training facilities.  This project, which                 includes an upgrade in utilities and the addition and relocation of             fume hoods, will address the need to improve the current research               infrastructure in terms of both safety and efficiency.                                                                                                          This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of undergraduate and graduate students.  It will               help support New Mexico State University in its important role of               educating minority students and facilitating their entry into and               retention in the human resources pipeline.",
