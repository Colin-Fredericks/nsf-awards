 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collagen fibrils are the principal components that give tensile                 strength and stiffness to animal tissues.  The fibrils are always               found together with other macromolecule - combinations of specific              carbohydrates and proteins: the association of collagen fibrils                 with these other constituents creates tissues with diverse                      structural and functional properties. Collagenous tissues are thus              properly thought of as biological fiber-reinforced composites.  In              most instances, the tensile properties of collagenous tissue are                constant over short periods of time, because the collagenous and                noncollagenous components are stable, as are their associations                 with one another.  In these stable tissues the interfibrillar                   molecules can only be guessed at.  No reliable measurements have                been made.  Echnioderms, in contrast, developed at an early stage               of their properties.  under the control of the nervous system,                  these tissues can be rapidly switched from a strong and stiff state             to a state in which they easily flow.  In the extreme, this ability             allows echnioderms to escape predation, as in the autotomy of a                 portion of the arm of a brittle star, or of the viscera of a sea                cucumber.  Sea urchin spines are held against the body wall by a                conical ligament.  When the spine moves, this ligament easily                   changes length.  At other times (for instance when the animal is                resisting being forcibly removed from an underwater crevice), the               ligaments become stiff and the spines are nearly immovable.  The                body walls of sea cucumbers can flow, permitting the animals to                 move into and through narrow openings, but can also become stiff,               preventing a predator from dislodging the animal from a protected               niche.  The collagen fibrils in these and other echnioderm                      connective tissues are as stable as those of other animals.  But                they are able to slide past one another when the tissues are  int               heir compliant state, and are prevented from sliding when the                   tissues are stiff.  The surfaces of the fibrils and the material                between the fibrils must sometimes permit the fibrils to slide,                 while at other times they lock them in position.  The experiments               described in this proposal are designed to tell us what molecules               are present on the surfaces and between the collagen fibrils in                 selected echinoderm tissues, how they are organized, and how they               are altered to change the tissue properties between stiff and                   flowing states.  Besides contributing to an understanding of these              inherently interesting tissues, the results of the planned research             h may lead to a better understanding of the composite structure of              collagenous tissues in general, including those of vertebrates.//",
