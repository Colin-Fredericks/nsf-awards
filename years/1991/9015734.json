 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to determine why some avian species live               in colonies.  This long-term project is unique in that it is                    designed to follow thousands of individual cliff swallows for the               duration of their lifetimes.  These birds nest in colonies of                   many different sizes.  Birds living in colonies which range in                  size from very small to extremely large will be monitored for                   several years and their lifespans calculated.  How many                         offspring each individual produces during its lifetime will be                  determined.  Differences in lifetime output of young will be                    related to the colony size each individual occupied.  This will                 reveal what sorts of evolutionary costs and benefits individuals                can expect in different size colonies.  Many of the presumed                    costs and benefits of group  living are believed to be universal                for all social species, including humans.  This research will                   used a nonhuman model species to gain an understanding of the                   consequences of group living.",
