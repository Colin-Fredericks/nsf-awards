 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. J.M. Kenoyer, Professor of                           Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin, Ms Seetha Reddy will               collect data for her doctoral dissertation.  She will conduct a                 range of analyses to explain a change in settlement pattern which               took place during Harrapan times, between 2500 and 1700 B.C.                    Archaeological evidence indicates that over this interval a shift               occurred and many settlements were established in arid areas in                 Northern India which had been avoided up to that point.  Ms Reddy               postulates that changes in agricultural practices allowed this to               occur.  She believes that farmers began to plant drought                        resistant millet crops as a supplement to the species already                   employed and that these millets were used not primarily for human               consumption but rather as livestock fodder.  To evaluate this                   hypothesis, she plans to collect three types of data.  First,                   isotopic analysis will be conducted on animal bones from sites                  which span this period.  Changes in carbon isotopes can be used                 to infer dietary changes.  Secondly, Ms Reddy will conduct                      ethnographic research to look at livestock management practices                 in the region today.  Finally, she will study botanical remains                 recovered from relevant archaeological sites to determine both                  species present and methods of processing.                                                                                                                      This research is important for several reasons.  Archaeologists                 want to know how complex societies develop and decline.  The                    Harrapan culture reached the level of a \"civilization\" before it                disappeared and it is unclear what accounted for this phenomenon.               Ms Reddy's work should provide insight.  Secondly, the project                  will provide very useful data on human adaptation at a                          technologically simple level to semiarid environments.  Harrapan                peoples developed efficient ways to subsist in this situation and               increased understanding of these may produce practical benefits.                Finally ,this research will assist in the training of an                        extremely promising young scientist.",
