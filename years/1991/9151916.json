 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is enabling Vanderbilt University to acquire                       instrumentation to teach about the nonlinear interactions of                    light with matter, as part of the University's advanced                         laboratory in optics and lasers. The project is motivated by                    increasing demand for significant instruction in the techniques                 and concepts of modern optical physics, both in the advanced                    laboratory and in independent study and in honors projects.                     Recent proof-of-concept experiments have included studies of                    nonlinear laser-matter interactions in Chinese green tea,                       cresyl violet dye, and ion-implanted fused silica. This                         project-oriented approach to nonlinear optics with cw lasers is                 giving undergraduate students a unique opportunity to have fun                  with serious optical physics, and motivating them toward early                  involvement in research.The project is enhancing teaching                       effectiveness, because nonlinear laser interactions are at the                  heart of many of the most fertile areas of laser and optical                    science. Moreover, nonlinear optical physics in solids and                      liquids is a powerfully and quintessentially integrative field                  of inquiry, bringing together experiment and theory, optical                    and condensed-matter physics, quantum and classical physics.                    The new instructional activities using cw infrared and visible                  laser light include: studies of self-focusing and self-trapping                 of laser beams, optical switching experiments, and modeling of                  nonlinear processes in solids and liquids.NSF grant funds are                   being matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
