 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is establishing an undergraduate scientific                        visualization laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-La                      Crosse. Visualization technology is changing the way in which                   science is performed by providing new ways to apprehend                         structure in science. For exactly these reasons, visualization                  technology can have a profound impact on the way undergraduate                  students study science. The laboratory being established                        consists of three-dimensional graphics workstations and a                       compatible video projector.  Software to support applications                   of scientific visualization is being obtained through a                         combination of local development, using student programmers,                    and commercial sources. The project members are beginning                       development of applications in Quantum Chemistry, X-Ray                         Diffraction, Protein Conformation and Function, Numerical                       Solutions of Differential Equations, Orbital Mechanics, and                     Neural Networks. Providing undergraduate students with access                   to visualization technology will have a deep and lasting effect                 on their understanding of science and their motivation to                       pursue further study.",
