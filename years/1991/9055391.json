 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bank Street College of Education will implement a                           mathematics leadership project centering around a team of ten                   teachers from ten predominantly minority New York City                          elementary and middle schools. The leaders will participate in                  a three-summer program, and will serve as half-time                             mathematics specialists in their schools during the academic                    year. The goal of the project is to change the way mathematics                  is taught in these schools. Seventy teachers in the faculties                   of the schools will also participate in project activities                      organized at Bank Street, as well as in inservice activities                    led by the leaders at the school level, over the three year                     period of the project. Parent workshops are included, and a                     manual for inservice leaders will be developed and                              disseminated. Mathematical emphases for the leaders will be in                  the areas of: foundations of arithmetic, functions, geometry,                   and algebraic structures. Summer coursework will lead to a                      masters degree in education for the ten leader teachers.                                                                                                        Cost sharing is provided by schools and Bank Street as 219% of                  the NSF request.",
