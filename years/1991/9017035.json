 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research             project in mesoscale meteorology between Vesna Jurcec of Zagreb's               Hydrometeorological Institute, F. Mesinger of Belgrade's Institute              of Meteorology and Ronald B. Smith of Yale University is to continue            their study of Bora wind storms using observational, numerical and              theoretical approaches.  The Bora phenomenon is a severe, downslope             wind storm occuring along Yugoslavia's mountainous Adriatic Coast.              Bora-like winds also occur in Utah, the Cascade Mountains of                    Washington, and along the Alaskan coast.  Thus, research on the                 Yugoslav Bora can be applied to similar regions in the U.S.   The               investigators plan to continue to apply Smith's hydraulic model to              severe bora cases in the southern Adriatic.  Bora simulations are               planned using Dr. Mesinger's computer model on mountain airflow.                The Bora simulations, in turn, will be used to validate Dr.                     Mesinger's model.  The joint work with Smith will contribute to                 better understanding of the particular Bora wind storm and extend               our abilities to predict other severe storms and weather phenomena              connected to mountainous regions.                                                                                                                               This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The award,                except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav             institution.  NSF's goal to advance scientific knowledge is promoted            through the joint efforts and complementary expertise of the                    Yugoslav and U.S. investigators.",
