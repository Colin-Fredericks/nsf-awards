 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a visit by Dr. James D. Stasheff of the                     University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, to the University                    of Sydney, Australia, to work with Dr. Donald Barnes on                         cohomological methods in mathematical physics.  The researchers                 will address problems in cohomological physics in terms of                      developing and applying techniques developed by Dr. Stasheff                    in his earlier research in combination with the relevant and                    complementary expertise of Dr. Barnes.  These techniques fall                   into two broad categories:  homological perturbation theory and                 the study of higher order homotopy algebraic structure.                                                                                                         One approach to quantization is via a special kind of                           homological perturbation theory.  The terms in a perturbed                      differential can often be interpreted as higher order homotopy                  structure.  Dr. Stasheff identified a Lie algebra version of                    such structure in several different aspects of mathematical                     physics.  This project will further develop the formal theory                   of such \"strong homotopy Lie algebras\" and apply it to the                      physics.  The vast majority of examples of BRST cohomology in                   physics share the characteristic features of strongly homotopy                  Lie algebras.  This project will address the characterization                   of BRST cohomology along the characterization of spectral                       sequence constructors by Dr. Barnes.",
