 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ten students will receive support from this Research                       Experiences for Undergraduates award.  They will work under the                 direction of three faculty advisors for a period of two summer                  months.  In the preceding award, institutional support for five                 additional students was provided; a similar arrangement is                      anticipated with the receipt of this grant.  Much of the                        experimental work involves computational work which will be                     carried out in the Mathematics Computer Assisted Learning Center.               The center has excellent computer and software resources                        available to the researchers.                                                        The primary theme used during the first year to exemplify                  the experimental nature of mathematical research will be                        computational and combinatorial group theory.  Here computers                   have not only been used to check examples and discover patterns                 but also to settle problems which have been reduced to a finite                 number of cases.  After an orientation period, students will                    begin work on problems concerning the Mobius function of finite                 groups, finding the number of reduced expressions in the Coxeter                generators for elements of the affine Weyl group and, along a                   more geometric line, to look at the Hurwitz problem for finite                  simple groups of small order.  This final area concerns the                     problem of determining all possible genera of closed, orientable                surfaces which admit a symmetry by the group.",
