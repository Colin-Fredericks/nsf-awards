 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on a working conference to coordinate                      the efforts of Historically Black Colleges and Universities                     (HBCUs) and other predominantly minority institutions in                        developing a national agenda to carry out major reforms that                    will improve mathematics, science and engineering education                     for minorities.  This effort will also eliminate the                            duplicative or fragmented efforts by the representative                         underrepresented groups who will be attending this                              conference.                                                                                                                                                     One measurable outcome of the conference will be the                            establishment of a comprehensive interactive network that                       will implement the action plan that results from the                            meeting.  Another important outcome will be the sharing of                      information and resources among the participating                               institutions as well as strengthening their linkages with                       industry, governmental units, and professional societies.                       The principal investigator has devoted much of her                              professional life to science and engineering issues for                         minorities, including leadership roles on several NSF                           advisory groups, and is therefore highly qualified to lead                      this important effort.",
