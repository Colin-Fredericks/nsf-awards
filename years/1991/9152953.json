 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Faculty Scholars Program (FSP) Network is a network of                      computing systems set up in order to provide electronic mail                    and file transfer facilities for faculty at a number of                         Appalachian Colleges, as a means of helping them to maintain                    contacts with the University of Kentucky and other major                        research institutions.This NSF-funded project provides                          equipment which allows computers in the FSP Network to be used                  in five Appalachian colleges' instructional programs,                           especially in computer science and mathematics. The grant is                    managed by the Faculty Scholars Program at the University of                    Kentucky, and provides terminals and printers to member schools                 for use with the FSP Network equipment for specific                             instructional projects.  Results of these projects are                          disseminated by means of the network; projects done at one                      school are typically applicable at the other schools.By taking                  advantage of an existing network and already existing computer                  systems with an established means of software support, it is                    possible with a limited budget to add multi-user state-of-the-                  art computing systems to the instructional programs of several                  colleges.  Each school benefits substantially from the efforts                  of the other schools in the network.NSF grant funds for                         equipment are being matched with funds from non-federal                         sources.",
