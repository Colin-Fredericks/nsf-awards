 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on hemiparasitic species of the plant                  family Scrophulariaceae. It will emphasize the alkaloid and                     iridoid glycoside chemistry of the plants, how these                            metabolites may affect insect herbivores whose larvae consume                   the plants, and how some of the isolated iridoid glycosides can                 be utilized in the laboratory as chiral synthons. The plant                     species to be studied are parasitic on the roots of host plants                 which contain alkaloids. These alkaloids are transferred into                   the parasites and may themselves affect insect herbivores.                      Utilization of the alkaloids by the parasites as herbivore                      defenses will be studied as will specificity of the parasites                   for certain host plants and alkaloid transport from the host                    into the parasite. Since insect herbivores which utilize                        alkaloid- and iridoid-containing plants sequester and /or                       metabolize the compounds, a study of chemical transformations                   in insect metabolism of alkaloids and iridoids will be made.                    Relationships between iridoid glycoside structures and their                    ease of conversion to pyridine alkaloids will be investigated                   because, in some plants, iridoids are converted to pyridine                     monoterpene alkaloids, but pyridine monoterpenes expected from                  several iridoids found in very high plant concentration have                    never been isolated. Finally, since iridoids are readily                        available in multigram quantities from some of the plants under                 investigation and can be converted in high yield in a one-pot                   reaction to chiral, pentasubstituted cyclopentanes, a study                     will be carried out to convert these products to                                enantiomerically-pure carbocyclic nucleosides.                                                                                                                  %%%                                                                                                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                  Division will support the research of Dr. Frank R. Stermitz of                  the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University. This                  research will focus on hemiparasitic species of the plant                       family Scrophularicaeae whose members are parasitic on the                      roots of host plants which contain alkaloids. These alkaloids                   are transferred into the parasites and may themselves affect                    insect herbivores. Utilization of the alkaloids by the                          parasites as herbivore defenses will be studied as will                         specificity of the parasites for certain host plants and                        alkaloid transport from the host into the parasites. These                      latter two studies have important implications for the                          biodiversity question that is becoming of crisis proportions as                 the earth's rainforests are being threatened because simply                     preserving the genetic pool of plant species may not be enough                  if secondary metabolite composition is also dependant upon host                 species.",
