 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear dispersive waves form and propagate as packets of                rapidly oscillating wavetrains.  Modulation equations which                     describe this evolution, for conservative systems with exact                    solutions, were first derived, via an averaging method, by Whitham.             Lax and Levermore placed this work in an analytically well-posed                context by relating it to the zero dispersion limit of KdV.                     Recently, interest in dispersive waves has been renewed by the                  simultaneous development of many new ideas and methods.                              This grant is to enable some young researchers to attend and               participate in a NATO Advanced Research Workshop to be held in                  France in July, 1991.  They will have the opportunity to interact               with the world's leading researchers in this area as they share                 their diverse approaches and chart new directions and problems of               importance in this subject.",
