 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaboration between Professor                         Richard Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh and Professors                    Solange de Barros and Odair Goncalves of the Federal University                 of Rio de Janeiro, in cooperation with a physics group at the                   Federal University of Parana in Curitiba, Brazil.  The aim of                   the research is to conduct experimental and theoretical                         investigations into the elastic scattering of gamma rays and                    X-rays from atoms, based on complementary programs at the                       three above universities.                                                                                                                                       The main focus will be on anomalous scattering (elastic                         scattering of photons with energies near atomic absorption                      edges).  Understanding the photon scattering process is                         important in improving the technology base and the basic                        understanding of atomic and solid-state physics.  The                           project will attempt to identify suitable choices for a                         critical comparison of theory and experiment.  The researchers                  will study the effects of different atomic potentials and use                   experimental information to understand the limits of certainty                  in predictions near atomic edges.  Their experimental work                      will test the validity of these predictions.  The theoretical                   research will be conducted at the University of Pittsburgh.                     The experimental work will be performed at the Federal University of Rio        de Janeiro and the Federal University of Parana.",
