 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an important need for compact, lightweight, efficient laser            systems that are tunable.  In order for these laser systems to achieve          the beam quality and the small size and weight required, they must be           solid state systems.  The most efficient source for pumping these               systems is the diode laser where 50% efficiencies are possible.  In-5+          order to efficiently couple the pump light into the laser and to                efficiently extract any heat generated, a fiber laser would be the              most attractive.  LaserGenics Corp. has the exclusive license to the            patents held by Stanford University on the laser-heated pedestal-               growth technique that we will apply to the growth of single crystal             fibers of titanium doped A1203, YA103, and MgA1204.  These materials            are very attractive as tunable laser sources.  During the course of             our proposed program we will study the effects of composition,                  temperature, atmosphere, and pull-rate on the growth.  We will also             study annealing procedures on these fibers to reduce the titanium to            the +3 valence state.  During the Phase II effort we will further               optimize the growth of these fibers and construct a tunable fiber               laser breadboard based on the single crystal fibers we have grown.",
