 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many policy analysts recommend higher energy taxes as a way                of dealing with environmental problems such as global warming.                  An important potential objection to the use of higher energy                    taxes is the claim that they are regressive.  Another major                     concern is the effect of these taxes on economic efficiency.                    Both the progressivity issue and the efficiency issue require                   estimates of demand curves or at least elasticities to quantify                 the effects.  Thus they require specification of a demand                       function.  The contribution from this project comes from                        developing new nonparametric estimation approaches to estimation                of demand curves and the related efficiency measures.  The                      progressivity estimates and efficiency estimates obtained using                 these new procedures will be robust to demand curve                             specification.                                                                                                                                                       The project will estimate models of gasoline demand using                  household data collected by the Department of Energy for the                    years 1979 through 1988 where over 18,000 observations are                      available.   It will estimate the progressivity effects and                     efficiency effects of gasoline taxes by income and expenditure                  class and by geographical region to.  The project will also use                 data from the Department of Energy to estimate the demand for                   consumer durables.  Durables such as air conditioners and                       refrigerators have both important environmental effects and                     energy using effects.                                                                                                                                                The methodological research on nonparametric estimation of                 demand functionals has four parts:  the comparison of parametric                and nonparametric approaches for demand curve estimation,                       derivation of exact welfare measures in the nonparametric case,                 derivation of asymptotically normal sampling distributions for                  welfare measures in the nonparametric case as well as the                       parametric case, and analysis of the sensitivity of the welfare                 measures to components of nonparametric regression estimators                   such as kernel choice and window width.",
