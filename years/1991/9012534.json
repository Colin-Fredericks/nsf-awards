 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two week Summer Training Institute in                     scientific visualization at the National Center for Supercomputing              Applications (NCSA).  NCSA is an NSF supported supercomputing                   center providing access time, education, training and consulting                services to scientific researchers.  The summer workshop will have              two basic components: an awareness component, and applications                  component.  Students will be provided with a historic profile of                the evolution of computer graphics into scientific visualization.               Perspective will be given to systems and methodology in this                    evolution.  After learning the nature of the field, participants                will look at the current sate of the art by taking an abstract                  approach to current visualization methodology.  This methodology                will be placed in the context of actual visualization tools and                 highlighted by case studies and practical examples.  The                        applications component will focus on visualization tools that are               available to the researcher.  This will be a \"hands-on\" approach                experienced in various NCSA laboratories.  Participants will work               with some of the applications available through NCSA, as well as                with some resources NCSA does not have, through vendor                          participation.  Courses will also include a survey of graphics                  system (hardware and software), introduction to 3D graphics and the             use of color in visualization.  Discipline specific experiences                 will include chemistry fluid dynamics, and engineering.  Media                  output options (videotape/film) will be available.  An evaluation               of the institute will be done following completion of the two week              session.",
