 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the establishment of a statistical               teaching laboratory.  It is being funded under the                              Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which                 has the goal of supporting projects to develop new or improved                  instrument-based undergraduate laboratory courses in science,                   mathematics, or engineering.  The Instrumentation and Laboratory                Improvement Program provides matching support for the                           instrumentation necessary to implement undergraduate                            instructional improvements at U.S. colleges and universities.                        In particular, the main objective of this project is to                    enhance the teaching of statistics to undergraduate engineering                 students.  The statistical teaching laboratory will be configured               so that demonstrations of simulations and statistical engineering               principles can be brought to students and so that students can                  use the laboratory to perform exercises, simulations, and                       otherwise interact with computer programs designed to demonstrate               statistical concepts.  The primary courses to be affected are                   introductory engineering statistics, introductory probability and               statistics, and statistics for quality and productivity                         improvement.",
