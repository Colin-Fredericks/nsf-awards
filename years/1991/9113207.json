 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the early 1970s, some groups of organized labor in the               United States have been deeply involved in issues of occupational               health and safety.  There is some evidence, however, that these                 programs have not functioned as smoothly as anticipated.  This                  Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant conducts the                        preliminaries for developing a project to study the conditions that             promote the development and maintenance of sound and effective                  health and safety programs.  Interviews and data from newspapers,               congressional documents and union archives will provide data on                 textile union shops in North Carolina and Tennessee to assess                   program maintenance costs, to determine whether labor had to make               concessions in order to insure the continuation of the programs,                to evaluate the degree of satisfaction of labor with the operation              of the programs, and to measure how successful the programs have                been in decreasing the number of accidents, injuries, illnesses and             deaths on the shop floors.                                                                                                                                           This project will enhance our understanding of the importance              of health and safety issues under conditions of growing                         international competition, the weakening of the trade union                     movement, and the faltering of the economy.  This project also                  provides an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to              lay the foundation for conducting further research on the dynamics              of the protection of the health and safety of American workers.",
