 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well known that the analysis of Time-Varying                              Linear (TVL) and Nonlinear (TVNL) dynamical                                     systems has been an elusive mathematical problem                                since the beginning of the studies of differential                              equations.  Consequently, control, communication and                            signal processing systems with time-varying parameters                          are difficult to deal with.  Recently (1987-1989) a new                         and Unified Linear System Theory (ULST) has been                                established for the class of scalar TVL systems of the                          form.  Based on the theory, a novel stabilization control                       technique, called Extended-Mean Assignment (EMA)                                control, for TVL and TVNL dynamical systems has                                 been developed (1990).  The new theory and control                              technique is gaining an increasing interest in the                              control and systems community, and has found                                    potential applications in aerospace, manufacturing and                          defense industries.  The goals of this research project is                      to extend those results to the more general class of                            Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) TVL system                                      x = A(t)+B(t)u; and to promote industrial applications                          of the ULST and EMA control technique in control,                               communications and signal processing.  The proposed                             research will employ a differential-algebraic approach.                         The anticipated research results will establish a spectral                      characterization, precise stability criteria and solution                       techniques for the general class of TVL dynamical                               systems (differential equations) x = A(t)x+B(t)u, which                         will enable scientists/engineers to effectively deal with                       otherwise intractable scientific/engineering problems.                          It is believed that achievements in the proposed                                research areas will constitute a revolutionary                                  breakthrough in modern systems science and control                              engineering.",
