 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fuzzy set theory and neural network approaches                                  are two technologies which have proved to be                                    useful in the development of intelligent control                                systems.  The central focus of this research is to                              investigate the linking of these two methodologies                              for the analysis and construction of intelligent                                systems.  Particular benefit will come on one hand                              from the use of fuzzy logic structures to help in the                           crafting of these systems while on the other hand                               the use of neural concepts will help in the learning                            and parallel implementation.  The work in this                                  project will focus on four areas.  This first area is                           fuzzy logic controllers.  Part of the work here will                            concentrate on improving the performance of these                               kinds of systems by (among other methods) the                                   development of a neural implementation of fuzzy                                 logic control.  This will involve alternative                                   procedures for defuzzification as well as the                                   development of a formal mathematical                                            understanding of these control systems.  A second                               focus of the research is new learning system,                                   emphasing a new model called participatory                                      learning.  This model emphasizes the role the                                   current belief system plays in the learning process.                            Another important aspect of this model is an                                    independent critic which monitors the performance                               of the current belief system.  The third part of the                            research concentrates on the fundamental                                        relationship between fuzzy set and neural network                               theory.  Here, the P.I. will look at the relationship                           between the neural aggregation process and the                                  basic operations of fuzzy set theory.  A major goal                             is to make some connection between the set based                                operations of fuzzy set theory and the vector                                   algebra approach of neural networks.  The final                                 part of the research looks at the implementation of                             fuzzy expert systems rules in a neural framework, to                            see if these two technologies can provide some                                  insight into the manner in which experts develop                                rules.",
