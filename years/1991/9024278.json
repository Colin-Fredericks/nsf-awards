 "awd_abstract_narration": "The selection of combinations of sites at which to locate                  facilities has long been an important issue within the theoretical              domain of geography and related scientific disciplines; site selection          also has an immense range of practical applications for businesses,             governmental agencies, and other organizations.  Critical limitation on         the development of more sophisticated location decision-making                  procedures have been capacity constraints on computational systems.             With large numbers of possible combinations to be explored, the storage         and processing capacities of even the largest computers quickly are             exceeded.  Other limitations on the development of practical locational         decision-support systems have been difficulties in developing clear,            effective, and accurate displays of the results of computational                procedures.  Even when procedures succeed, users frequently must wade           through enormous tables in order to obtain the information on which a           decision ultimately is based.  This project will try to diminish both           sets of limitations.  One line of inquiry will consist of the                   development and testing of new algorithms that will allow use of                parallel computing systems for the solution of locational decision              problems.  The second line of inquiry will focus on the development of          more effective visual displays of data and solutions through the use of         object-oriented programming techniques.                                              This project will test the use of parallel computing architectures         for the solution of complex locational decision problems.  Although             concentrating on combinatorial site-selection problems, the results of          this research will provide insights into the utility of parallel                structures for solution of a much wider range of computational                  problems.  The project also will significantly enhance understandings           of the efficacy of object-oriented programming methods for more                 effective visualization of the results of locational decision-making            processes.  In doing so, broader issues of visualization of computer-           generated data and solutions will be addressed.",
