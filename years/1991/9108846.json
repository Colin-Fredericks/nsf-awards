 "awd_abstract_narration": "The widespread use of composites in the durable goods sector               of the civilian economy has been limited due to high material and               manufacturing costs.  The principle research objective of the State             Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Low-Cost, High-             Speed, Polymer-Matrix Composites Processing Center at the Michigan              State University is to advance the research and technology transfer             activities and to enhance the competitiveness of the producer and               user industries in the State and surrounding areas.  There are                  42,000 plastics related jobs in the State of Michigan and this                  total is expected to rise to 52,000 by 1995.  The State has                     targeted composites and plastics as a \"key\" growth area.                             The \"core\" research program will include the following                     technical thrust areas:  Advanced Prepregging, Thermal Management               and Novel Processing, Resin Transfer Molding, Reactive Processing               of Natural and/or Recycled Constituents, and Artificial                         Intelligence Techniques for Composites Design and Processing.  The              strong presence of the automotive industry along with its large,                medium, and small suppliers will provide a focus and realistic                  guidance to the research strategy.  The development of knowledge-               based processing systems in the form of computer software will play             an important role in technology transfer.  The participation of the             University of Michigan, Wayne State University, Michigan                        Technological University, and the Michigan Molecular Institute in               the \"core\" research program is a special feature of the center.                 Each participating company (28) in the center is providing one                  member to the Industrial Advisory Board.  The Michigan Materials                and Polymer Institute (MMPI), a private, not-for-profit industrial              funding consortium will channel its industrial contributions and                responsibility for this area to the center.  The State of Michigan,             industry and NSF will provide matching funds totalling $750,000 in              the first year.  An additional $184,000 will be provided by                     industry.",
