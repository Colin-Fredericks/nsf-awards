The long-term operation of fermentation                      and cell culture processes and the commercialization of                         therapeutic proteins have been impeded by stability                             problems.  Oxygen, metals, and reducing agents found in                         bioprocessing media combine to cause irreversible damage                        to proteins.  The rate constants and parametric                                 sensitivities of this class of oxidation reactions have                         not been systematically studied under industrially                              relevant conditions, and highly reactive polypeptide                            sequences have not been identified.  Thus, no quantitative                      kinetic models exist for use in process design, control,                        or optimization, nor is sequence information available for                      protein engineering strategies.  This work intends to lay                       the foundation for the ultimate goal of identification of                       effective process and/or protein engineering strategies                         for minimizing oxidative damage.",
