 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new symmetrization method for the numerical solution of                  partial differential equations on emerging parallel computers                   will be studied.  The algorithmic development of the method in                  the context of massive parallelization will be emphasized.  The                 method of symmetrization is attractive for an elliptic partial                  differential operator, A=S+BT in that it transforms the problem                 in A to one in an operator that is self-adjoint and that closely                resembles S, the self-adjoint part.  Thus, by invoking symmetry                 even for nonself-adjoint problems, it allows the use of efficient               and robust versions of multilevel and conjugate gradient                        algorithms for the solution of the arising linear systems of                    equations.                                                                           The use of multilevel and conjugate gradient algorithms in                 the implementation of the method on a parallel computer will                    provide the opportunity to study parallelization in a context                   where a multilevel algorithm itself is used as in inner solver                  for an algorithm composed of inner and outer iterations.  The                   algorithms will be tested in a massively parallel environment                   offered by the Connection Machine.",
