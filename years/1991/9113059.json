 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the formation of strained rings                           containing both alkoxy and arylphosphonium salt functional                      groups so that their utility in a tandem ring expansion-Wittig                  reaction can be assessed.  The alkoxycyclopropyl and cyclobutyl                 phosphonium salts will be prepared from beta-oxophosphonium                     salt derivatives.  Formation of these substituted strained                      rings has not been reported, so an efficient method leading to                  their synthesis is of clear value.  In addition, their                          preparation will lend new insights into the reactivity and                      applications of the beta-oxophosphonium salts, which are                        themselves important Witting reaction precursors.  Finally, the                 study of the ring cleavage of these strained rings followed by                  a subsequent Witting reaction will determine whether this                       method will be suitable for development in more complex systems.                %%%                                                                             Research Planning Grants enable women who have not had prior                    independent Federal research support to develop a competitive                   research proposal.  This project involves organic chemical                      reactions leading to medium-sized rings which are common in a                   large number of natural products.",
