 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most population genetic models assume that mating is random                with respect to the character of interest.  However mating is                   often nonrandom with respect to many characters that influence                  mating success.  There is considerable evidence that success in                 male-male competition and/or female mate choice is a fairly                     common contributor to nonrandom mating in variety of species.  As               a result, there has been a growing attempt to generate genetic                  models of the process and effects of such selection.                            Unfortunately, the number of models has exceeded our empirical                  knowledge of this process, resulting in a growing call for                      studies that begin to test the predictions and assumptions                      contained in mathematical models.  This study will begin to                     address this need by examining the genetics of secondary sexual                 characters, courtship pheromones, and sexual behavior in                        Nauphoeta cinerea.                                                                   Empirical studies have been hampered by a lack of suitable                 model species.  The cockroach N. cinerea has many attributes that               facilitate genetic studies of sexual selection, including short                 generation time, facultative parthenogenesis, and well                          characterized behavior.  These qualities permit a detailed                      examination of assumptions and predictions derived from                         theoretical studies.  Variation in female mate choice, male                     social behavior, male attractiveness, and related male pheromones               will be assessed by behavioral assays and gas chromatography.                   Genetic variances and convariances within and between the sexes                 will be estimated from a paternal half-sib mating design.                       Artificial selection based on male attractiveness to females will               be used to confirm genetic estimates obtained from the breeding                 experiments.                                                                         The information generated from this study will increase our                general knowledge of the phenotypic and genetic structure of                    pheromones and chemical communication.  In addition, this study                 will be sufficiently detailed to test several predictions and                   assumptions of mathematical models of sexual selection and the                  evolution of sexual dimorphism.  Finally, these experiments will                provide empirical data that bear on several issues in                           evolutionary genetics.",
