 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research represents a continuation of isotopic                measurements of atmospheric species and reactions of direct                     importance to tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry.  The PI                 proposes to conduct five individual tasks: (1) Recent kinetic                   measurements by Troe et al. for O + O2 + M recombination have                   shown that, at pressures to 1,000 bar pressure, the rate constant               varies in an unpredicted fashion which may be related to the                    anomalous 18O, 17O fractionation in O3 formation and in the                     stratosphere, which is presently not understood.  High pressure,                variable temperature, bath gas experiments are proposed to                      resolve the role of electronic excitation and radical complex                   mechanisms upon isotopic fractionation in O3 formation and to                   define the mechanism of the mass independent oxygen isotopic                    fractionation process in O3 formation.  (2) Using presently                     developed experimental and theoretical techniques, the PI                       proposes to measure the rate of isotopic exchange between the                   species O3-O2-O and CO2,H2O, N2O and CO.  Anomalously large 18O                 enrichments exist in stratospheric O3,H2O and CO2, but which are                not understood.  There are no measurements of most of the                       isotopic exchange rates needed to model these reactions.  (3) The               PI has found a new isotope effect in the thermal decomposition of               O3.  He proposes to resolve this mechanism as it is of importance               to general isotopic fractionation processes and chemical                        reactions.  (4) A variable 17O/18O ratio in atmospheric CO2 has                 been measured, which the PI has demonstrated is removed by CO2-                 H2O exchange.  Determination of the source of the variable                      17O/18O and exploration of applications as a quantitative measure               of the lifetime of CO2-H2O exchange and general mixing, e.g.                    stratospheric-tropospheric exchange are planned (5) High                        precision 18O tropospheric O2 measurements will be maintained                   specifically to verify 18O variations in Santa Ana conditions and               measure stratospheric O2 samples.",
