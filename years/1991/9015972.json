 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Rudolph A.                  Abramovitch will study the synthesis and chemistry of                           five-membered heterocyclic nitrenium ions. These species are                    highly reactive intermediates whose chemical reactivity is of                   interest to physical organic chemists and to theoretical                        chemists. In addition to their inherent theoretical interest,                   these species are of potential importance as a new class of                     electrophilic primary aminating agents that are of interest to                  synthetic organic chemists as well.                                                                                                                             Of particular interest is the potential ability of these                        species to undergo isomerization to other cationic systems.                     The generation and trapping of these heterocyclic sigma-cations                 by nucleophiles will be studied via ion cyclotron resonance                     mass spectrometry in an effort to obtain information concerning                 the operation of pi-to-sigma \"electronic isomerizations\" in the                 nitrenium ions. Trapping experiments will also be performed in                  solution with the same objective in mind. Detailed analysis of                  the various reaction products thereby obtained is expected to                   afford insight into the nature of the reactive intermediate(s)                  present in each case.",
