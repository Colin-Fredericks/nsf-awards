 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory:  This                         laboratory is used as an engineering core laboratory to                         mechanical and civil engineering students to provide a basic                    understanding of material properties.  Additional laboratories in               these departments provide added study in the strength and                       properties of materials.  Through a sequence of laboratory                      exercises students are introduced to material property                          determination and stress analysis using both experimental and                   theoretical models.  However, there is a need to improve the                    laboratory facilities which experimentally reinforce the                        principles learned in the lectures courses.  The objective of                   this project is the acquisition of undergraduate laboratory                     equipment in the materials and properties analyses area to                      develop a more complete undergraduate introduction to material                  properties and stress analysis.  The improved laboratory                        facilities will enable students to become more knowledgeable in                 the various methods of materials and structural analysis.",
