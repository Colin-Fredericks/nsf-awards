 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Pembroke                  State University is updating and upgrading the computer                         equipment available for use in its courses for preservice                       teachers.  Preservice teachers need to learn how and when to                    use the computer as a tool in their classrooms, especially                      prospective science and mathematics teachers.  The computer                     tools they use during their education must be up to date.                       These tools should be similar to those they might expect to                     encounter as new teachers but preferably somewhat better.  Two                  important aspects of modern educational computing are computer                  networking and multimedia use of the computer.  The new                         equipment is networked and has multimedia capability to allow                   the inclusion of these topics in the curriculum.  The equipment                 is also used to make improvements in the general introductory                   course for non-majors.",
