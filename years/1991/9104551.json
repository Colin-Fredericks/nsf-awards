 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elicitor treatment of bean or soybean cell suspension cultures                  causes rapid cross-linking of preexisting structural proteins in                the plant cell wall, following a burst of oxidative metabolism and              generation of hydrogen peroxide at the plant cell surface.                      Oxidative cross-linking is also under developmental control                     associated with cellular maturation, eg., during hypocotyl growth,              and in tissues subject to mechanical stress, eg., the stem-petiole              junction.  Stimulus-dependent oxidative cross-linking of pre-                   existing structural proteins in the plant cell wall is a novel site             of cellular regulation, with potentially important functions in                 the flexible realization of the final functional architecture of                cell walls during plant development, and rapid toughening of walls              in the initial stages of microbial attack or related stresses.                  Moreover, the rapid response to defined elicitors, which is                     initiated within 1-2 minutes and complete within 5-10 minutes,                  provides the basis for functional dissection of the initial steps               in the perception and transduction of elicitor signals.  The                    present proposal seeks to explore the regulation of oxidative                   cross-linking, underlying signal mechanisms and the impact of                   cross-linking on cell wall properties.//",
