 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will analyze the relationship between firm                location decisions, geographic concentration, and trade patterns                by developing several related theoretical models and empirically                testing the results.  The foundations will consist of an imperfect              competition model of firm location, in which learning spillovers                from direct contact with suppliers and customers provide an impetus             for concentration.  The model will be extended to analyze the                   evolution of firm location and trade patterns over the product life             cycle.  A second extension will consider the effect of government               intervention on industry location.  The research will conclude with             empirical tests of the relationship posited by the model between                comparative advantage and concentration of related industries and               consumer density, as against competing hypotheses emphasizing                   factor supplies and transport costs.                                                                                                                            The Research Planning Grant would be used to review related                     literature, to develop a working paper version of the model                     illustrating the core relationships, to assess the evidence on                  relevant government policies, and to identify and tap data sources              for the empirical component.  It would lead to the submission of                a full research proposal to the NSF at the end of one year.",
