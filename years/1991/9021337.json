Probably as a result of                the disuse of Chiwere as an every-day form of communication for                 more than a generation, all present-day speakers of Chiwere, even               fluent ones, exhibit some gaps in their knowledge of the                        language.  These inadequacies appear to be patterned.  This                     project addresses the problem of integration of divergent and                   partial knowledge toward recovering a complete grammatical                      system.                                                                              Accommodation theory, a theory most usually applied to gain                understanding of dialect variation and shift in synchronic                      settings, appears to offer a guide to integrating these various                 less-than-perfect competencies into something resembling a                      relatively complete picture of Chiwere as it was in its full                    vibrancy of life.  The specific goals for this project are (1) to               develop this method for recovery of the complete linguistic                     system from several incomplete models, thus enhancing the                       description of Chiwere; (2) to devise an explanatory model of                   language change in Chiwere that may be more generally applicable                for the whole of the Great Plains languages; (3) to reconstruct                 the paths of language death, i.e., to make a case histroy of                    language death in Chiwere; (4) to test hypothese suggested by                   accommodation theory about the pattern of decline in Chiwere and                its relevance for indicating important features of the language.",
