 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for partial support for a conference in                   hadron spectroscopy and a one week school in the subject,                       aimed at graduate students and postdoctoral associates, to be                   held the week immediately before the conference.  The proposed                  venue for both events is the University of Maryland at College                  Park.  The conference is fourth in a biennial series that                       began at the University of Maryland in 1985, and was supported                  by NSF in that year.  It has since circulated through KEK in                    Japan in 1987, Ajjacio (Corsica) in 1989 and is now proposed                    for Maryland in 1991.  Broadly interpreted, in the sense of                     including both light and heavy quark hadron states, the                         subject is of direct interest to all experimental and most                      theoretical physicists.  The focus of the proposed conference                   is likely to be somewhat more on the light quark states where                   interest is still quite widespread.  At the present time, it                    appears that at least one hundred persons have expressed an                     interest in attending the conference.  The school is also                       likely to be well attended at the level proposed of about 20                    students.",
