 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, sponsored by East Tennessee State University,                     will provide a six-week summer program for each of three                        years for 28 teachers and 7 principals.  The participants                       will be selected in teams of two middle school science                          teachers, two high school science teachers and one                              principal all from the same school district.  The summer                        program will teach an integrated science curriculum                             emphasizing hands-on-science and problem solving as                             required by the new Tennessee State curriculum guideline.                       The participants will return to the schools to carryout                         leadership activities in the schools.  Altogether it is                         expected that 100 teachers will be served by the project                        each year.  The project will be coordinated with a previous                     K-6 project and thus a coordinated K-12 science curriculum                      will be developed in the target schools.  The NSF grant is                      being matched by local funds in an amount equivalent to                         about 30%.",
