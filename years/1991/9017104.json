 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goals of this research are to understand the cellular             and molecular basis for host defense reactions in selected                      invertebrate systems.  These systems offer relative simplicity and              may represent a paradigm for vertebrate blood cells.  This proposal             deals with defining which of two cell types is involved in the                  formation of a large multicellular syncytium that functions in a                host encapsulation response in echinoderms.  Two distinct subsets               of coelomocytes will be separated from other coelomic fluid                     components, the subsets will be marked and their fate during fusion             will be followed.  The ultrastructure of apparent syncitia will be              studied to establish whether cell-cell interaction results in the               formation of true synsytia, and cytoskeletal linear elements that               may orient cortical flow and/or influence the formation of the                  cellular aggregate will be identified.  The relationship between                cytoskeletal motility and cell fusion events will be determined                 using high resolution, digitally enhanced video microscopy.                     Cortical motility of cells that do and do not fuse will be                      compared, and patterns of cortical motility in cells after fusion               will be studied.                                                                                                                                                In sea urchins migratory phagocytic cells known as coelomocytes                 play important roles in the organisms' defense mechanisms such as               engulfing foreign micro-organisms, wound repair, and blood                      clotting.  Some aspects of the defense reactions in these animals               involve the ability of the phagocytic cells to fuse with each                   other, which may be related to their ability to encapsulate                     invading parasitic organisms or to their clot forming ability.                  Very little research on the cell biology of these important defense             reactions in invertebrates has been done taking advantage of modern             techniques.  The results of this project will provide a detailed                analysis of the cellular events underlying the process of                       coelomocyte fusion and will lay the groundwork for further analysis             of the function of defense responses in these organisms.",
