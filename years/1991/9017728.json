 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is increasing evidence that the geomagnetic dipole                   moment was less than one half of its present value prior to                     15,000 B.P.  This would lead to an increase in 10Be and 14C                     production by 40%.  Short term variations in the cosmic ray flux                are also thought to have occurred.  For example, two spikes in                  10Be concentrations in the Vostok ice core from Antarctica have                 been found.  It seems unlikely that they were formed due to a                   change in climatic conditions.  The increase of 10Be is probably                due to an increase in production of 10Be due to increased cosmic                ray activity in the atmosphere induced by supernovae or                         geomagnetic excursions.  A hemipelagic sediment core from the                   Blake Outer Ridge and a varved sediment core from the Gulf of                   California offer a good opportunity to observe variations in 10Be               and 14C production during the last 100,000 years because of                     continuous, constant, and high rate of sedimentation on the                     cores.  Ocean sediments should provide an important archive of                  data concerning changes in 10Be production.  Unlike the ice                     cores, the ca. 300-year residence time of 10Be in the sea                       minimizes local variations due to climate.  Correlation of 10Be                 \"events\" between both cores should establish whether the events                 are of worldwide or local origin.  In addition, paleomagnetic                   data have already been measured in the cores making correlation                 possible with the 10Be production curve.  Sedimant samples are to               be analyzed for 10Be and 14C at the TAMS facility at the                        University of Arizona.  9Be will be measured by atomic absorption               spectrophotometry.  Reservoir models will be evaluated to define                the nature of the event.",
