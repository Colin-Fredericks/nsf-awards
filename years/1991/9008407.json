Yet changes               on these time scales are hard to predict because we have yet to                 isolate climate forcing factors in this frequency range.  Project               ARRCC aims to evaluate past variations in climate on annual to                  century time scales in order to develop a better understanding of               the types and magnitude of the changes observed as well as to                   evaluate two potential causes: changes in solar activity and the                effects of volcanic aerosol input into the atmosphere. Project                  ARRCC will produce detailed time series of climate variations for               the last 500 years, an interval which includes the Little Ice                   Age.  During this interval there was also a significant reduction               in the number of sunspots (the Maunder Minimum) leading many                    researchers to suggest some causal relationship.  The PIs in                    Project ARRCC will synthesize the quantitative paleoclimate data                for this time interval and compare the results to model                         simulations which vary the intensity of incoming solar radiation                and the reflectivity of the atmosphere because of changes in                    volcanic aerosol concentration.  This research is important for                 three reasons: 1) it will be the first synthesis of this                        important paleoclimate event; 2) it will produce a rigorous,                    global data base of past climate for use by other researchers;                  and 3) it will be the first rigorous attempt to quantify the                    effects of solar radiation and volcanic activity on climate                     change.  This research is a high-priorty for the US Global Change               Research Program.",
