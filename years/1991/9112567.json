Professors John H. Frederick and                      Kent M. Ervin, Department of Chemistry, University of Nevada,                   Reno, are the U.S. organizers and their counterparts in Japan                   are Professors Yoshiyasu Matsumoto, Koichi Yamashita, and                       Hrvoje Petek of the Institute for Molecular Sciences (IMS)                      in Okazaki, Japan.  The workshop will encourage and facilitate                  the initiation of research collaboration among early career                     scientists from the United States and Japan in the area of                      theoretical and experimental molecular spectroscopy and                         dynamics.  Panel discussions will be featured on the following                  topics:  i) gas-surface interactions  ii) spectroscopy of                       clusters/solulte-solvent interactions  iii) intermolecular                      dynamics of highly excited molecules and  iv) spectroscopy of                   the transition state/reaction dynamics.  These topics share a                   number of common challenges and concerns, among them the                        characterization and modeling of intermolecular forces, the                     nature of pre-and post-bond dissociation dynamics in highly                     excited molecular species, the role of an external bath (or                     solvent) in relaxation and accommodation processes, and the                     relationship between spectroscopic observations and the                         underlying molecular dynamics.                                                                                                                                  The twelve participants from both countries will each deliver                   a seminar on their research area which will be followed by                      group discussion.  They will also participate in guest                          lectures covering specific areas of molecular dynamics,                         discussions on future direction and challenge, and a visit to                   the laboratories of the Institute for Molecular Sciences.                       This Institute (IMS) is the ideal host for the workshop since                   one of its objectives is to promote international exchanges                     between Japan and other countries.  Because the participants                    are drawn from early-career scientists, the collaborations                      formed as a result of this workshop expect to affect the                        future direction of research in both countries, over a long                     period of time, to the mutual benefit of both the U.S. and                      Japan.",
