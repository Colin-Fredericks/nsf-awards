 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pheromones are chemical substances that individuals release into                the external environment that affect the behavior and/or                        physiological states of other individuals of the same species.                  It is one of the major forms of communication.  Although a number               of pheromones have been identified in insects and are now being                 use as a non-invasive form of pest control, little is known about               precise neural, endocrine and evolutionary bases of pheromone                   function in vertebrates.  Dr. Sorensen reports that fish have                   evolved a highly-developed chemosensory and pheromonal signalling               system which play fundamental roles in mediating reproduction and               other behavior interactions.  He has described two hormonal                     pheromones, one of which is comprised of unknown metabolites of F               prostaglandin.  These results are particularly intriguing since                 prostaglandins are thought to mediate reproduction in many fish.                                                                                                Dr. Sorensen has teamed with Dr. Goetz, an endocrinologist, and                 Dr. Brash, a prostaglandin biochemist, to determine the chemical                identities, biological functions and hormonal origins of the F                  prostaglandin metabolites.  This research is of both scientific                 and practical importance.  First, the results will demonstrate                  for the first time in a vertebrate the intimate link between                    hormones, pheromones, olfactory function and behavior.  Thus, the               findings have broad implications about fundamental mechanisms                   underlying the neuroendocrine basis of sex pheromone function in                vertebrates.  Second, the intimate relationships between hormones               and pheromones revealed by this work should have direct carryover               into improved aquacultural practices that require controlled                                                                                                    maturation and synchronous spawning.  The application of                        pheromones have enormous potential among both wild and cultured                 fish that are experiencing reproductive failure and for which                   direct hormone manipulations is too difficult, stressful or                     costly.  Conversely, as is presently the case with bio-control of               insects, pheromones may be used to control undesirable exotic                   fish such as the lamprey by attracting them to traps, repelling                 them, or confounding their reproductive behaviors.",
