 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the renovation and                    repair of the Ralph M. Parsons Laboratory for Water Resources and               Environmental Engineering which houses the environmental science                and engineering research and research training activities of the                Civil Engineering Department.  This building was constructed in                 1950 and last renovated in 1969.  The ARFMP grant of $700,000 and               $859,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to                modernize these research and research training facilities.  This                project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure by (a) refurbishing the environmental chemistry and              biology laboratories so that state-of-the-art research can be                   performed and modern research equipment can be most effectively                 used in them; (b) consolidating the hydrodynamics facilities to                 enhance their utility; and (c) making more efficient use of the                 space so that a new environmental microbiology laboratory can be                added, the capacity of computer work stations can be expanded, and              growth in the population of student research assistants can be                  achieved.  The benefits that accrue from this renovation can be                 expected not only to improve the cleanliness and safety of the                  research environment but also to enhance the efficiency of                      research, the capacity to address environmental engineering and                 science problems involving very hazardous substances and samples                containing only trace quantities of chemicals of interest, the                  ability to blend modern microbiology with the currently predominant             physical and chemical environmental research activities, and the                ability to train more students.                                                                                                                                 This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                   graduate students in a department with a strong commitment to the               recruitment of minority and women students.",
