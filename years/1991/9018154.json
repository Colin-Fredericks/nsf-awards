 "awd_abstract_narration": "The activity of the tomato the tomato fruit pectin-hydrolyzing                  enzyme polygalacturonase (PG) increases dramatically during                     ripening due to the presence of three closely related isoforms,                 PG1, PG2A and PG2B.  The Pg2 isoforms are composed of single                    catalytic PG polypeptides while PG1 is a heterodimer consisting of              one PG2 polypeptide in tight association with an ancillary                      glycoprotein, the PG converter.  The involvement of each isoform                in pectin degradation and other aspects of fruit ripening remain                unclear.  The PG isoform levels in planta appear to be determined               by the level of converter protein.  In order to increase our                    understanding of the biosynthesis, assembly and biological activity             of cell wall enzymes such as PG, the levels of individual PG                    isoforms will be manipulated in vivo by altering the levels of                  converter protein in transgenic wild-type plants.  To accomplish                this the converter protein will be purified, cloned and its                     structure and expression during wild-type fruit ripening studied.               Converter protein levels will be manipulated by expressing a                    converter cDNA in sense and antisense orientations in transgenic                wild-type tomato plants presumably resulting in accumulation of                 only PG1 or PG2.  These studies will increase our knowledge of the              effect of individual PG isoforms on polyuronide degradation and                 other physiological parameters associated with fruit ripening.                                                                                                  Several enzymes and structural proteins are secreted from plant                 cells into the cell wall.  The activities of these proteins are                 essential for normal growth and development as well as specialized              functions such as fruit ripening and plant defense.  An important               question is how the activities of such important proteins is                    controlled when they are secreted from the cell and not subject to              the normal mechanisms associated with the regulation of cytoplasmic             enzymes.  This proposal describes an interesting approach to                    studying the processing and function of an extracellular enzyme,                polygalacturonase, which degrades polyuronides in the cell wall                 during fruit ripening.  //",
