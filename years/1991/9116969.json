 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies of welfare recipients in the United States                       have found that most of them remain on welfare for only                         short periods of time.  However, the evidence also shows                        that a small number of recipients are highly dependent on                       public support and have long welfare careers.  These long                       term recipients are also responsible for the largest portion                    of welfare expenditures.  Although much has been learned                        about this important phenomenon, a wide range of issues                         related to the process and patterns of welfare dependence                       remain to be investigated.                                                                                                                                      This project proposes to study the patterns and determinants                    of welfare use and dependency in the Deep South, an area                        which has a higher concentration of poverty, larger numbers                     of poorly educated people, and a higher concentration of low                    wage employment than other parts of the country.  Due to                        these factors, among others, the Deep South region provides                     particularly suitable conditions for testing hypotheses                         related to welfare dependency.  One of these, on which                          attention is centered, is the so-called culture of poverty                      hypothesis.  This states that high concentrations of                            poverty, existing over many years, may lead to the emergence                    of a welfare culture which translates into long term welfare                    use and to inter-generational transmission of welfare                           dependency.                                                                                                                                                     The study will investigate empirically individual, social,                      cultural, labor market, and institutional factors that lead                     to long term welfare use.  The main thrust will be to                           specify lifetime models permitting the estimation of the                        duration of time on welfare.  In addition, the study will                       focus on labor market models incorporating job search,                          unemployment durations, and wage determination as they                          relate to welfare use and dependency.  Survey data of AFDC                      recipients from the state of Tennessee and from the Survey                      of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) will be utilized.                                                                                                    The investigator is asking very important policy-related                        questions, the answers to which promise to provide                              information crucial to welfare reform.  The empirical work                      involved marks one of the first SIPP analyses of the problem                    of welfare dependence.  The new evidence will enable                            valuable comparisons with earlier studies based on PSID and                     NLSY surveys.",
