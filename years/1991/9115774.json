 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent evidence shows that epidermal browning of tall-                     stemmed, long-lived cacti is related to total time of sun                       exposure.  Epidermal browning is much greater on the southern                   exposures of such cacti in the Northern Hemisphere and on                       northern exposures of similar species in the Southern Hemisphere.               This surface browning leads to death of individual cacti.  An                   evaluation of authentic photographs of saguaro cacti an Arizona                 for the past 90 years shows that epidermal browning has                         increased by about 4% per decade, the same percentage increase in               ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure in the United States over the               past three decades.  The increase in ultraviolet light exposure                 has been shown to be related to the depletion of the ozone layer                in the stratosphere.  The data base (473 cacti) of saguaros has                 been able to show the sequence of steps during epidermal                        browning.   The purpose of the proposed research is to make the                 same series of phenological and physiological measurements on                   several species of cacti in Chile and Argentina, to determine if                the sequence of steps of epidermal browning is similar to those                 of saguaros.  If the sequence of steps is similar among all these               cacti (both Northern and Southern hemispheres), the basis for                   further investigation of a possible mechanism for UV-indeed                     injury would be strengthened.",
