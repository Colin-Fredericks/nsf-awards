 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award.  The long-term              goal of Dr. Brodl's research is to understand the cell biology of               higher plant responses to environmental stress.  The model system               for investigation is the heat shock response of the aleurone layer              of barley grains.  The cells of this tissue are normally dedicated              to protein secretion; however, heat shock dramatically redirects                their cellular activities.  The synthesis of secretory proteins is              abruptly arrested when the tissue is subjected to heat shock, yet               the synthesis of nonsecretory proteins continues.  This is                      accomplished by the selective destabilization of otherwise stable               secretory protein mRNAs.  Heat shock also causes the loss of                    endoplasmic reticulum lamellar structures upon which secretory                  protein mRNAs are translated; only small fragments of ER remain.                This appears to provide the discriminatory mechanism for                        selectively stopping the synthesis of secretory proteins, as                    nonsecretory protein mRNAs are not translated by ER-bound                       ribosomes.  Dr. Brodl will continue and extend his studies of the               molecular and cellular basis for these heat shock-induced events.                                                                                               This research program should provide insights into the cell biology             of ER, as well as reveal mechanisms for regulating protein                      expression during heat shock.  These efforts will ultimately build              a better understanding of how plants respond and adapt to stress.",
