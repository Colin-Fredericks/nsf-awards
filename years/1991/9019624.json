 "awd_abstract_narration": "Direct development is an evolutionarily derived life history mode               in vertebrates and invertebrates in which the free living,                      aquatic larval stage is lost. This project examines the pattern                 and mechanisms of cranial development in direct developing                      anurans, and how these differ from those in metamorphosing taxa.                Experimental and descriptive methods include immunohistochemistry               (to localize the embryonic distribution of type II collagen and                 visualize the initial skeletal pattern); scanning electron                      microscopy (to document neural crest morphology and migration);                 heterospecific transplantation of premigratory cranial neural                   crest and cranial ectoderm (to examine inductive tissue                         interactions that underlie the development, and loss, of cranial                tissues); in vivo administration of thyroid hormone and TH-                     blocking agents; TH radioimmunoassay (to measure the contribution               of TH from maternal and embryonic sources); and conventional                    histology. Analyses will focus on Eleutherodactylus coqui                       (Leptodactylidae), whose ontogeny is among the most derived of                  any direct developing anuran with respect to the ancestral                      metamorphic pattern of cranial development. Reference data                      concerning the ancestral pattern will be obtained from several                  phylogenetically diverse species,including Bombina orientalis                   (Discoglossidae), Xenopus laevis (Pipidae), and Rana pipiens                    (Ranidae). Results will contribute to our understanding of the                  basis of direct development in amphibians and how this important                life history mode has evolved. They also will be used to address                a series of issues in developmental and systematic biology,                     concerning the relation between development and morphological                   evolution. These include the evolutionary implication of                        mechanisms of cranial pattern formation; the importance of                      ontogenetic repatterning vs. heterochrony; the role of inductive                tissue interactions; and the hormonal mediation of embryonic                    development. finally, they will allow comparison of direct                      development in amphibians with that in other groups with complex                life cycles.",
