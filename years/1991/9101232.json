 "awd_abstract_narration": "Machine-readable dictionaries (MRD's) contain knowledge about                   language and the world essential for large-scale tasks in natural               language processing (NLP).  This knowledge, however, collected                  and recorded by lexicographers for human readers, in not                        presented in a principled enough manner for MRD's to be used                    directly as tools for NLP tasks.  What the NLP research community               needs is machine tractable dictionaries (MTD's); that is MRD's                  transformed into a format for NLP tasks.  Previous work has                     developed a range of tools for extracting information from MRD's                for NLP tasks in general.  This work will combine these methods                 based on their respective strengths.  It will define the SPIRAL                 methodology which combines various elements of the three methods                into a single coherent procedure.  Different forms of knowledge                 are derived from each individual method and each is incomplete in               certain respects; yet the combination of the three yields better                results than could any individual method.  In particular, the                   goal is to construct an MTD as a data-base of lexical facts,                    together with a network of statistically-related word sense.  The               MTD will support the automatic construction of lexicons for many                types of NLP systems, form those using traditional methods based                on syntax and semantics to those based wholly on statistical                    methods.",
