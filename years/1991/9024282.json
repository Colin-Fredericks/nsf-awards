 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award in petrology and geochemistry will                          support collaborative research between Dr. Emi Ito of the                       University of Minnesota and Dr. Brian Bell of the                               University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland.  The objective                        of the proposed project is to generate a new set of                             stable isotopic, structural, petrochemical, and petro-                          graphic data on the Cuillin Complex, a classic, volcanic                        region located on the Isle of Skye, Northwest Scotland.                         The data will be used to quantitatively characterize the                        hydrothermal fluid flow and mass transfer in relation to                        the cooling history of the region.                                                                                                                              The Cuillin Complex consists of multiple concentric                             igneous intrusions separated by significant geological                          time gaps.  Recent isotopic studies suggest two or more                         phases of fluid flow.  Ito's previous research in this                          area suggest that a channelized flow through fractures                          may have been important and in this project she and Bell                        propose to investigate this question further.  The                              investigation will describe the fluid flow and mass                             transfer by detailed mapping of the geometry, the                               distribution of the veins, abundance of minerals, changes                       in rock compositions.  Fieldwork and  sampling will be                          conducted jointly.  The laboratory analysis will be                             handled in both Scotland and the U.S.  Dr. Bell's group                         in Glasgow will generate the petrochemical data, determine                      the mineral composition of the samples using electron                           microprobe analyzer.  Dr. Ito will perform the stable                           isotope analysis of the separated mineral samples and                           whole rocks.                                                                                                                                                    This research combines the complementary expertise of Ito                       and Bell and is expected to advance understanding of the                        interactions of thermal, mechanical and chemical processes                      during the cooling of magmas (molten materials) in the                          earth's crust.",
