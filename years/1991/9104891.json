 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the subgroup structure of                   finite and algebraic groups of Lie type.  The principal                         investigator will consider general reductive overgroups and                     the minimal connected overgroup of arbitrary unipotent                          elements.  She will also examine certain triples of                             quasisimple groups of Lie type in an effort to classify the                     maximal subgroups of the finite classical groups.  Finally she                  will work on extending a homomorphism of finite groups of Lie                   type to a morphism of suitable algebraic groups.                                     A group is an algebraic object with a single operation                     defined on it.  Groups occur naturally in many different areas                  of mathematics, as well as, physics and chemistry.  During the                  last decade, many researchers have worked on determining the                    subgroup structure of finite simple groups of Lie type.  The                    approach used in this project is to view the question on                        finite groups in the context of algebraic groups.",
