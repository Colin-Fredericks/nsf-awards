 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to improve the quality of undergraduate                        education in statistical methods, experimental psychology, and                  honors research by providing high-quality research and analysis                 tools for student lab exercises and projects.  Nine                             microcomputers, one laser printer, 12 copies of a statistical                   software package, 10 copies of a run version of experimental                    psychology software, and three copies of a meta-analysis                        software package will be added to existing equipment and                        organized into four types of units: (a) 12 statistical analysis                 stations for sophisticated univariate and multivariate                          analyses; (b) one experiment development unit with 26 prepared                  experiments and the capacity to create a wide range of                          experiments; (c) 12 experiment run stations for collecting data                 from experiments created on the development unit; and (d) three                 meta-analysis units for quantitative literature reviews.  The                   equipment would raise the quality of student activity in                        several courses, improve students' graduate training prospects,                 and compensate for meager institutional computing resources.                    The department's success in attracting a large number of majors                 (9%) and preparing almost half of them for graduate school                      (45%), in addition to the university's substantial percentages                  of women (64%) and minorities (30%; hispanics 17%), make this                   project very valuable.",
