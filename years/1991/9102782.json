 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies several mathematical aspects of fluid                 mechanics.  Computational tests will be conducted for numerical                 methods, known as vortex methods, for time-dependent, inviscid,                 incompressible fluid flow.  The test problems used are vortex                   rings with swirl; they can be computed reliably by other                        researchers using variational methods.  The results may serve as                a guide in the application of vortex methods and may suggest                    possible improvements in the methods.  An analysis of the errors                in related methods for fluid interfaces will be initiated, in the               hope of better understanding their design.  In such cases a                     moving interface is tracked, along with information determining                 its velocity.  A convergence proof will be attempted along the                  lines of earlier analysis for vortex methods.  Work on the                      construction of exact solutions for the equations of                            three-dimensional water waves, representing interacting                         long waves, of the type modeled by the Korteweg-de Vries                        equation, will be continued.  Near-resonances with waves in the                 usual scaling have led to delicate analysis.  Finally, the                      relationship between the equations describing large-scale                       atmospheric and oceanic motions and their singular limiting form,               the quasi-geostrophic equations, will be investigated.  The                     nature of this approximation is closely related to the generation               of unwanted small scales in time or space in the solutions of                   the full system.                                                                     In many situations where the nature of fluid flow is                       of practical importance, such as the flow past an object or                     combustion, quantitative prediction is difficult because of                     the large number of variables involved.  The development of                     reliable methods for numerical simulation of realistic flows                    offers the hope that a greater number of test cases could be                    studied with less effort than through experiments alone.                        Vortex methods are a special class of methods which have                        particular advantages in important but difficult cases.                         An interface occurs where one kind of fluid motion meets                        another.  Analysis and numerical simulation can predict                         whether or not desired configurations can be maintained.                        The proposed work might suggest improvements in the numerical                   methods used for these special problems.  Nonlinear waves                       of the type described in the third topic have been found                        to be remarkably stable in water and in other physical                          settings; they are completely different from the waves                          occurring in linear theory.  Little is known about                              their fully nonlinear interaction.  The last topic is                           a mathematical investigation of the fundamental and                             long-standing question of how the equations for large-scale                     circulating flow in the atmosphere or oceans can be                             reduced to a simpler system.  One cannot hope to solve                          the full system accurately, and much effort has been                            devoted to finding ways to predict the main features                            by calculating a smaller number of variables.",
