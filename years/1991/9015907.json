 "awd_abstract_narration": "The molecular order in thin films of surfactant solutions on                    solid surfaces will differ from that in bulk solutions.  The                    unique features of the ordering may include the self-assembly                   of monolayers on the bounding interfaces, the induction of new                  liquid crystalline order in the film, and the ordering of                       macromolecular assemblies such as micelles within the film.                     Such structures will affect the stability and dynamics of                       these films and will control the wetting and spreading of bulk                  fluid bodies attached to them.  Although the subject of a                       number of earlier investigations, questions remain open                         concerning the arrangement of surfactant molecules in thin                      films on solid surfaces.  Direct measurement of this molecular                  ordering will clarify some of these outstanding issues,                         providing new understanding of the influence of interfaces on                   self-assembly and impacting on a number of technologies which                   involves interfacial properties and spreading of surfactant                     solutions.  X-ray and neutron reflectometry are rapidly                         evolving techniques which can probe the molecular arrangements                  in such films.  Using these techniques, the nature of the                       molecular monolayers on the bounding interfaces of thin films                   on solid surfaces and the ordering of the surfactant molecules                  within the films is explored.",
