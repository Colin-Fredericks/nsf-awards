 "awd_abstract_narration": "Points in scene, when illuminated, reflect light not only in                    the direction of the sensor but also between themselves.  These                 interreflections can appreciably alter the appearance of the                    scene.  Existing vision sensors and algorithms do not account for               the effects of interreflections and hence often produce erroneous               results.  An initial investigation studied the effects of                       interreflections on shape information recovered by shape-from-                  intensity methods (e.g. photometric stereo).  It was discovered                 that, for Lambertian surfaces, the erroneous (pseudo) shape                     recovered in the presence of interreflections is unique and can                 be mathematically related to the actual shape.  An algorithm has                been developed that uses a physical interreflection model to                    recover the actual shape of the surface from the psuedo shape.                  The research will be extended in the following directions.                      (1) The analysis of non-Lambertian (e.g. specular)                              interreflections.  This entails the development of mathematical                 models for non-Lambertian interreflections as well as their                     application to the problem of recovering accurate shape in the                  presence of interreflections.  (2) The detection and correction                 of errors produced by existing vision sensors (spot scanners,                   light stripe range finders, stereo systems) as a result of                      interreflections.  For each sensor, a sensor model is used to                   obtain physical constraints that aid the analysis of                            interreflections.  All analytical results will be verified by                   laboratory experiments.  This research should achieve (a)                       fundamental advances in the analysis of interreflections and (b)                substantial improvements in vision sensing technology.",
