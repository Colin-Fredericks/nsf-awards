 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conservation and management of species whose habitats are                       diminishing require an understanding of endocrinological and                    behavioral factors that lead to successful reproduction.                        Since 1983, Dr. Boersma has been studying such a species in                     Argentina and has identified some 5,000 individuals.  She has                   found that when two individuals establish a long-term pair bond,                their reproductive success is significantly greater.  Little is                 understood about how this increased success is achieved.  With                  the help of her graduate student, Mr. Fowler, and Dr. Wingfield,                a world renown field endocrinologist, hormone changes will be                   determined across two full breeding seasons.  They will examine                 the relationship between age, pair-status, hormone profile, and                 how these factors interact to influence reproductive success.                   Utilizing these behavioral and endocrinological techniques will                 help to understand the mechanisms whereby established pairs of a                long-lived species produce a higher number of offspring.  These                 data will not only fill a significant gap in our knowledge of                   physiology but has the enormous potential of directly influencing               the management programs underlying conservation and restoration                 of biological diversity.",
