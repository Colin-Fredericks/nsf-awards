 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is basic research in the                          development of an intelligent learning sensor model.  Intelligent               control systems provide functions beyond conventional control                   systems, including learning and expert decision making.  Each                   intelligent sensor, within a control system, will possess those                 aspects of intelligence appropriate to its function, and this                   intelligence will operate only on information available to the                  sensor.  Intelligent sensors will be modeled as objects in an                   object oriented programming environment, where properties and                   functions of generic intelligent sensors are inherited by more                  specific sensor objects.  The object oriented approach provides a               means of isolating sensor specific code in the object                           representing that sensor and a knowledge base that can make the                 sensor self educated and self organized.  The model of the                      intelligent sensor will be created, in first instance, as an                    empty structure where the various aspects that define the model                 will be filled as the work progresses.  The research will                       specifically develop the aspect of learning as an essential                     functional characteristic of the intelligent sensor.  Two other                 characteristics, interpretation and estimation, have been                       extensively researched and will be directly implemented as part                 of the model.  Models of intelligent ultrasonic and temperature                 sensors will be created for experimental verification. //",
