 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapidly oscillating patterns of electrical potentials from nerve                cells have been recently reported to be synchronized across                     multiple regions of the visual cortex of the brain.  The origins                and function of the oscillations are unknown, but their                         specificity to certain stimuli and synchrony across regions                     suggest they may relate to some fundamental visual or cognitive                 function.                                                                                                                                                       This project will test whether the synchronized oscillation in                  visual cortex is related to visual perception.  Specifically, it                will test the novel idea that the synchronous neural activity                   across a region of cortex reflects a cohesive visual image                      assembled from visual stimuli that move together in a \"coherent\"                way.  Single nerve cells in the cortex are known to handle                      specific properties of visual images, such as location,                         orientation, color, and temporal features.  These experiments                   will record from single neurons at multiple sites in visual                     cortex while presenting visual stimuli that are either                          independent, or connected into a coherently moving object.  This                test will determine if the coherent oscillation appears only with               coherent movement of stimulus pieces.  If so, further experiments               will explore how the coherence may be related to perception.                    There is a risk that if not, the excitement about such                          oscillations may considerably diminish.  The impact of this                     limited study of this novel idea will be very high on visual                    science and neuroscience in general, and if the outcome is                      positive, the impact will extend to cognitive science as well.",
