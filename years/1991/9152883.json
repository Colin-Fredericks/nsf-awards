 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fields of computer engineering and digital data                             communications are becoming interwoven rapidly. Examples of                     systems where the disciplines overlap are the telephone                         network, computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) systems and                    the various local area networks (LANs) serving commerce and                     education.The computer engineer should understand the                           principles of digital data communications. The B.S.Co.E.                        computer engineering program at the New Jersey Institute of                     Technology includes a two course sequence in the senior year,                   communications theory and lab. Also, electrical engineering                     students wishing to specialize in communications, one of the                    senior year options in the B.S.E.E. program at NJIT, need to                    increase their understanding of digital data communications                     through a stronger lab experience. The educational experience                   of both sets of students is being strengthened considerably by                  the development of this multidisciplinary laboratory.  The                      equipment being obtained comprises combined pattern generator,                  pattern detection equipment to measure the bit error rate in                    data communications systems, multiplexer/ demultiplexer                         equipment to experiment with the mixing of several data sources                 on a single medium, and distortion analyzers which can measure                  the signal/noise ratio and distortion level of transmitted                      signals.",
