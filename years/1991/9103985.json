 "awd_abstract_narration": "The northern Apennines, Italy, have excellent exposures of                 these two types of basins in close proximity and is the type area               of piggy-back basins.  Rock type and geometry; distribution of                  cements and pores with respect to bedding planes, faults, and                   shales; sandstone/shale ratio; and burial and tectonic history are              major features that will be compared.  Diagenetic features will be              studied using polarized light, scanning electron microscopy,                    cathodoluminescence, electron probe microanalysis, fluid                        inclusions, stable isotope geochemistry, heavy mineral composition,             vitrinite reflectance, apatite fission-track data in addition to                outcrop relations.                                                                   The purpose of this project is to compare and contrast                     cementation and other diagenetic aspects of age-equivalent                      sandstones from two different types of sedimentary basins, piggy-               back and foreland, in order to isolate causes and effects and to                identify the relative importance of the many variables controlling              diagenesis.  Understanding sandstone diagenesis in sedimentary                  basins has an important applied use in assessing hydrocarbon and                water reservoir quality of sandstones and in assessing the role of              rock-water interactions in sandstones used for toxic waste                      disposal.  Understanding diagenesis in sandstones also is essential             to interpreting the post-depositional history of sandstones, the                sources and sinks of chemical components, and interpreting the                  provenance of sandstones.                                                            This is a cooperative study involving four Italian sedimentary             geologists (Universities of Modena and Bologna) and four                        sedimentary geologists from the University of Texas at Austin.  The             reasons for doing the study in the northern Apennines are: 1) there             are excellent exposures of coeval rocks deposited in two different              types of basins in a small geographic area (200 x 150 km), 2) the               stratigraphy and sedimentology of the rocks and structural history              are known, and 3) opportunity for international cooperation on a                project for which the Italian team has obtained support.",
