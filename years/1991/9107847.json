 "awd_abstract_narration": "An online problem is one in which an algorithm must handle a sequence           of requests, processing each request without knowledge of the future            requests.  Online problems are encountered frequently in computer               science.  They are especially common in computer systems and data               structures.  The standard method for evaluating an online algorithm is          called competitive analysis.                                                    This project has three parts.  The first is to investigate specific             online problems, principally from the competitive viewpoint.  These             problems include some well studied problems that have remained open             and some new problems identified in this proposal.  The second is to            understand the role of randomness, especially in finding simpler or             more efficient algorithms.  Finally, it has been observed that in               several applications, algorithms designed to be competitive are out-            performed by other, equally competitive, and sometimes non-                     competitive, algorithms.  To explain this behavior, the third part of           this project is to find a new metric for the evaluation of online               algorithms.  Such a metric is likely to be a refinement of competitive          analysis.",
