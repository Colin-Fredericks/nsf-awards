 "awd_abstract_narration": "In addressing the need for a technologically literate public and                for technically trained people sensitive to the social context,                 it would be useful to have information about the values and                     knowledge already had by people who are to be further educated.                 There is scarcely any empirical data about the values and                       relevant knowledge with which undergraduates enter courses, such                as STS courses, intended to foster these kinds of literacy.  The                courses, therefore, derive from a synthesis formed by specialists               and instructors and, at best, superficial generalizations about                 the starting points at which students find themselves.  This                    research project addresses the need for empirical data about the                understanding of STS issues with which both humanities and                      engineering undergraduates come into these courses.  By                         interviewing undergraduates from engineering and the humanities                 and also specialists in STS studies, the researchers will gather                data to begin to shed light on the needs of students in STS                     courses.  The findings will also be valuable for gaining a                      clearer understanding of how to go about studying these issues in               a more comprehensive way, less burdened by untested assumptions.                The findings will be disseminated to those who can make use of                  them in STS and engineering courses, and to wider audiences as                  well.                                                                                                                                                           The investigators are very well qualified; the institutional                    resources are very good; the issues are important; results will                 be appropriately disseminated.  The project is meritorious and                  recommended for award.",
