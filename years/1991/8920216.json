 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California, Davis, will establish a Science and               Technology Center for Engineering Plants for Resistance Against                 Pathogens.  The Director of the Center will be Professor George E.              Bruening.                                                                                                                                                       The goal of the center is to develop an integrated molecular and                biochemical understanding of plant responses to diverse pathogens.              The tomato will be developed as a model organism for these studies.             Participants will include faculty from the University of                        California, Davis and Berkeley campuses, Cornell University,                    Washington University, and scientists from Calgene, Inc.                                                                                                        The Center has three major research objectives:                                 1.  Genes and molecules that mediate recognition of pathogens by                plants will be characterized.  The types of molecules involved in               the early determinative phases of plant-parasite interactions will              be identified and used to demonstrate the recognition capabilities              of the plants' defense mechanisms.                                              2.  Molecular characterization of susceptible and resistant host                responses will be accomplished by identifying the genes and                     molecules that are differentially regulated during susceptible and              resistant responses.  Signal-transduction pathways and regulatory               mechanisms will be dissected genetically and biochemically.  Genes              that potentially mediate susceptible or resistant responses will                be functionally analyzed in transgenic plants.                                  3.  Novel strategies for interfering with pathogen increase,                    movement, or transmission will be developed.  The initial focus                 will be on the mechanisms of viral replication and transmission.                The efficacy of satellite and defective interfering RNAs,                       transgenic plants expressing viral coat protein, and transgenic                 plants expressing defective transmission proteins will be                       investigated.                                                                                                                                                   The molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions is one of the                 major unknowns in plant biology.  Successful completion of the                  basic aspects of this work should lead to the development of novel              means to control plant disease in a variety of crops.  This would               in turn reduce the amount of chemical fungicides and pesticides                 required for crop protection, thereby reducing both production                  costs and environmental contamination.                                                                                                                          The center will stimulate enhanced interdisciplinary training in                the plant sciences and the development of human resources.",
