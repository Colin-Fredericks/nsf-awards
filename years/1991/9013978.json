 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the possible exception of the Sun, pulsating white dwarfs show             the greatest potential for probing the interior structures of stars             by experimental means.  A rich variety of vibrating waves, visible              at the surface by their change in the star's luminosity, are                    excited in these stars that interfere with one another throughout               the star's interior.  The pattern of interferences can be used to               infer the amount of material each wave travels through, and hence               the distribution of material through the star can ultimately be                 determined.  These principles, similar to those used for decades                by seismologists on the Earth, are now being applied to distant                 stars for the first time.  The white dwarf stars are the best                   candidates not only because they exhibit so many vibrations but                 because their periods are short enough that many wave cycles can                be followed by observing the stars' light variations.  The                      Principal Investigator has spent most of his research career                    designing and building photometric instrumentation to make accurate             light measurements.  In a previous NSF award, the PI and his                    collaborators found that a prototype three-channel photometer they              had constructed (one channel for the program star, one for a                    constant \"standard\", and one for a starless \"sky\") increases the                amount of time during a night that an astronomer can spent actually             collecting data.  The new award will permit the PI to construct two             portable duplicates of this prototype.  These instruments will be               transported by his colleagues to observing sites around the world.              As part of an \"observing campaign\", target stars will then be                   observed in tandem by each of these observers as the Earth rotates.             Following this campaign the data will be combined and a continuous              several day-long string produced that is necessary for the analysis             of interior properties of white dwarf stars.",
