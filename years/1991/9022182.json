 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sociolegal scholars have devoted considerable attention to research             in the area of eyewitness evidence and identification in recent                 years.  Although significant advances have been made in the                     scientific identification from lineups and photospreads, all                    progress has been of one form, namely reducing the likelihood of                false identification without affecting adversely the likelihood of              correct identifications (hits).  The selection of distracters so                as to meet functional or effective-size requirements has been a                 major tool for reducing false identification rates.  This project               follows on the recent theoretical argument that, depending on the               strategy used to select distracters, two lineups of equal                       functional or effective size can have different amounts of                      propitious (beneficial) heterogeneity with the result of having                 strikingly different hit rates.  It is argued from theory and pilot             data that implementing ways of maximizing the variance between the              suspect and the distractors can improve the hit rates so that                   witnesses are more likely to correctly identify the suspect.                                                                                                    Three experiments are designed to fully test the propitious                     heterogeneity idea for improving hit rates without inflating false              identification rates.  The experiments follow a basic format in                 which crimes are staged for unsuspecting witnesses who later are                presented with a lineup and asked to identify the culprit.                      Comparisons are made between lineups that include distracters who               were chosen to (a) resemble the suspect, (b) match the eyewitness's             description of the culprit, or (c) match the description plus                   maximize the propitious variance.  A confidence-accuracy relation               will be assessed in each experiment with the expectation that the               relation will be stronger when propitious variance is high.                                                                                                     This research has theoretical value in advancing basic                          understanding of the process of eyewitness identification.  From                a practical standpoint, such knowledge about the dynamics of lineup             procedures could lead to increased quality and efficiency by which              justice is administered in criminal cases.   Finally, in the area               of cognitive psychology, the study will illuminate theoretical                  issues associated with recognition memory.",
