 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of photoaffinity immobilization of specific binding                 proteins has been patented and reduced to practice with antibody                on glass by this company. The development of additional reagents                and reaction procedures is proposed for the affinity coupling                   (covalent) of receptor molecules (especially antibodies) to the                 activated surface of passivated (by hydrophilic spacer coating)                 silicon-based sensors. Additional trifunctional photoreactive                   reagents will be synthesized and coupled to the sensor surface                  for the specific covalent binding of monoclonal antibody (using                 one of the two antibody binding sites), leaving the remaining                   stabilized antibody binding site available for functional                       exchange between surface-immobilized analyte and free analyte                   molecules in the test sample. The specific, one-step                            purification-covalent immobilization of the antibody through a                  long, hydrophilic, flexible tether adjacent to the short-spacer                 immobilized analyte group, is expected to provide cost efficient                production of stabilized immunosensors with improved performance                (faster response and regeneration, as well as increased                         sensitivity, particularly where rapid analyses are required). The               system proposed will detect toluene and/or related aromatic                     hydrocarbon derivatives. Demonstrating laboratory feasibility                   with this immobilized, stabilized immunosensor system with this                 type of analyte will support the utility of this technology for                 sensitive, rapid, and selective sensing and monitoring of                       biologically active agents. The sensor device will reversibly                   recognize and quantitate analyte content in batch or continuous                 sampling situations and transduce the signal with electronic                    recording and transmission of data. Such a device would offer a                 broad  range of applicability for periodic sample analysis and                  real time, on line monitoring of fluids (air, water) as well as                 dosimetry measurements in air and physiological fluids.",
