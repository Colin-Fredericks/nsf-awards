 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is known that the freezing of saline soils or of soils                       saturated with herbicides, fertilizers or various contaminants                  may result in the exclusion and concentration of the solute or                  contaminant at the freezing front.  Solidification of                           industrial coatings and ingots is also associated with                          segregation at the freezing front, dendritic crystal growth,                    the formation of a mushy zone, and density-driven convection,                   suggesting that an analogy exist between the freezing of                        saline soils and the solidification of castings.  In castings,                  the redistribution of the solute by the interdendritic liquid                   flow causes nonuniformities (segregation) in alloy composition                  and affects the physical and mechanical properties.                                                                                                             This research proposal outlines a fundamental study of flow                     and heat transfer processes in a system involving the                           solidification of salt solutions in a porous medium.  A                         rectangular test cell containing an aqueous salt solution and                   metallic or nonmetallic spheres with solidification beginning                   at one vertical wall would be studied.  Specifically this                       research project will 1) record the transient and spatial                       variation of temperature within the system, 2)                                  photographically record the freezing process to provide                         qualitative and quantitative information, 3) develop a                          mathematical/numerical model of the solidification process in                   the presence of double-diffusive convection and 4) compare the                  predictions of the model with the corresponding experimental                    data.                                                                                                                                                           An understanding of the role of interdendritic liquid flow in                   the porous media can aid in predicting segregation processes                    in freezing soils, and also in the control of the quality of                    castings.",
