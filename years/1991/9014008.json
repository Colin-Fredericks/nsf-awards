 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop on spatial and temporal aspects of ecological                   scaling as they relate to exchanges of water, carbon, and energy                in terrestrial ecosystems will be conducted at Snowbird, Utah from              December 2-5, 1990.  It will focus on scaling between leaf-level                ecophysiological processes, the whole plant, the community, the                 ecosystem, and the globe.  Issues of scale dominate and constrain               the contributions of ecophysiology to global change research.  Yet              it is evident that ecophysiologists, whose primary interests lie                in mechanistic, process-level studies, have not adequately                      considered linkages between their disciplines and others interested             in the ramifications of these processes at broader geographical and             longer temporal scales.  This workshop will bring together                      ecophysiologists, ecologists, biometeorologists, ecosystem                      ecologists, and remote sensing specialists interested in the                    challenge of scaling to meet the critical need of linking process-              level and global scale interests.  In content and format, this                  workshop will be geared toward formulating the paradigms and                    facilitating the contacts necessary to establish the role of                    ecophysiology in the emerging field of earth system science.",
