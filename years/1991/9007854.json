 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first step in chemical process design is simulation of the                  systems, whether they be individual units (such as reactors,                    heat exchangers, distillation columns, etc.), groups of units,                  or sometimes the whole plant.  These simulations yield                          equations which are usually nonlinear, and numerical methods                    of varying complexity have been devised to solve them.  Such                    methods usually begin with some initial educated guess of the                   unknown parameters and then some iterative method using the                     equations of the physical system is used to improve these                       values, such as direct substitution, accelerated direct                         substitution, various Newton-like methods, etc.  These are                      called fixed-point methods.  This research is concerned with                    building an understanding of:  (1) the fundamentals of the                      chaotic (such as period doubling, period tripling, strange                      attractors, etc.) behavior of fixed-point methods for steady-                   state process simulation, and (2) the relationship between the                  chaotic behavior of fixed-point methods for the steady-state                    simulation of processes and the chaotic behavior of processes                   as nonlinear, dynamical systems.                                                                                                                                Specific tasks under these two areas of work are as follows.                    To build a better understanding of chaos the PIs will: (a)                      conduct a numerical investigation and study of the practical                    implication of the geometric (or topological) structure (i.e.,                                                                                                  basins of attraction, basin boundaries, Julia sets,  the                        Mandelbrot set, etc.) in the complex domain, (b) study the                      qualitative effects of stabilization procedures (i.e., step                     bounding, trust regions, continuation) on geometric structure,                                                                                                  and auxiliary implications regarding automatic initialization                                                                                                   procedures, and (c) use established and/or develop new                          analysis tools (from differential topology and geometry) to                     build a fundamental theoretical understanding and                               classification of routes to chaos that are relevant to process                                                                                                  simulation.  To determine if there is an observable                             signature(s) of the chaotic evolution of unsteady-state                         processes that manifests itself in the steady-state equation                    solving task they will:  (a) conduct parallel steady- and                       unsteady-state numerical experiments in the complex domain to                                                                                                   determine if signatures of chaotic process dynamics are                         present in the associated steady-state equation-solving task,                                                                                                   and if so, determine the intrinsic properties of those                          signatures, (b) study the relationship between the geometric                    structure (i.e., basins of attraction, basin boundaries, Julia                                                                                                  sets, etc.) associated with the chaotic behavior of fixed-                      point methods for steady-state simulation and the geometric                     structure associated with the chaotic evolution of unsteady-                    state chemical processes, and (c) build a fundamental                           theoretical understanding of the signature process in an                        effort to characterize the chaotic time evolution of chemical                   processes directly from steady-state models.  All of their                      calculations will be in the complex domain.",
