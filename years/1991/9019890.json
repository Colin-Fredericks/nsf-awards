 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                      useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.                                                                                                 This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                      North Carolina at Chapel Hill acquire a 300 MHz spectrometer                    which will be used in research investigations in the following                  areas of chemistry.                                                                                                                                             1.
