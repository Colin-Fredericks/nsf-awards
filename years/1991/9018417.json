 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neutrophil activation in response to chemotactic agents, phagocytic             stimuli, and other endogenous regulators is a complex process                   involving migration, phagocytosis, degranulation and generation of              toxic oxygen metabolites.  Modulation of the neutrophil response                by intracellular second messengers, especially cGMP has been                    proposed, but no mechanism of action of cGMP has emerged over the               past two decades despite intensive investigation.  Dr. Pryzwansky               in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Lincoln has recently obtained                  evidence that the major cellular receptor for cGMP, the cGMP-                   dependent protein kinase (G-kinase) is present in neutrophils at                low concentrations, and may be compartmentalized to specific                    intracellular structures during cell activation.  To further define             the role of cGMP and G-kinase in neutrophil functions, the goals                of this research are: 1) to identify the intracellular compartments             or structure(s) associated with G-kinase by immunocytochemistry,                and to correlate its localization with cell function (motility and              degranulation),  2) to investigate the physiologic role of cGMP and             G-kinase by monitoring cGMP levels in response to chemoattractants              and other modulators, by identifying specific cellular protein                  substrates for the kinase, and by studying the effects on                       neutrophil function of antibodies to G-kinase introduced into                   neutrophils by electroporation.                                                                                                                                 Neutrophils play a vital role in host defense against                           microorganisms.  These specialized cells move in response to a                  chemotactic gradient and phagocytose and kill foreign                           microorganisms.  Although the regulatory mechanisms which control               neutrophil activities have been the topic of investigation for a                century, important gaps still remain in our understanding of how                these physiologic processes are regulated.  One area of potential               importance, but uncertainty is the physiologic role of the small                molecule, cyclic-GMP (cGMP), as a second messenger in controlling               neutrophil functions.  The combined cellular and biochemical                    approach proposed here should, for the first time, define the role              of cGMP in neutrophils. An important key to understanding this                  pathway of cellular signal transduction may be to understand the                subcellular distribution of the molecules involved.  A unique                   feature of this project will be the use of state of the art                     techniques of light and electron microscopy to study the                        subcellular localization of key signaling molecules within                      neutrophils in various functional states.",
