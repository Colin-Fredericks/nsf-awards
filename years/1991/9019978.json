 "awd_abstract_narration": "This a planning grant to develop a full-scale proposal                     for the support of a community-based network of technology                      learning centers.  The Playing to Win Network will address                      the question of how to make science, and math, and technology                   issues relevant to the undeserved.  Over the past 8 years                       the Playing to Win training center has provided training to                     teens and young adults in the predominantly minority                            community of Harlem (New York City) who need familiarity with                   math, science, and technology in order to keep a job.  The                      goals of the grant are (1) to identify communities to serve                     as pilot sites of the network, (2) to develop collaborations                    to support the larger network structure, and (3) to study                       existing network models, financial structures, and to develop                   a business plan.  Once the network is in place, further                         research into teaching and training techniques for minorities                   will be pursued.",
