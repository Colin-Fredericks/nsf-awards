 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor George Gruner of UCLA and a                       graduate student to collaborate with Dr. Karlheinz Seeger and                   other of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Solid State                         Physics and the University of Vienna, Austria.  They share an                   interest in the nonlinear ac response of the charge density                     wave (CDW) ground state.  By combining the experimental                         techniques available at the two institutions, they will                         explore a range of nonlinear frequency dependent phenomena of                   solids.  They will extend their previous collaboration on                       CDW's to the low temperature (or type II) CDW dynamics,                         which has properties fundamentally different from the high                      temperature dynamics.  In addition, they will begin new                         studies of the nonlinear ac response of high temperature                        superconductors, with experiments conducted as the function                     of both temperature and external magnetic fields.  They have                    previously studied the small amplitude ac response of the high                  temperature superconductors in the micro- and millimeter wave                   spectral range.  This work, which will be continued, is                         essential in interpreting nonlinear response.  Austrian                         scientists will come to UCLA to conduct the small amplitude                     (low field) ac response experiments on various single                           crystal and thin film specimens.  The same specimens will                       then be investigated for ac harmonic mixing at the Ludwig                       Boltzmann Institute in Vienna.                                                                                                                                  High temperature superconductivity is the focus of very great                   current interest.  Charge density wave research is also a                       very active area in solid state physics.  For both charge                       density waves and the superconductors in the vortex state,                      certain responses are fundamentally determined by lattice                       irregularities.  Thus there are significant variations from                     specimen to specimen, and the same key set of responses must                    be measured on each specimen.  The collaborating U.S. and                       Austrian research groups bring a unique combination of                          capabilities to bear on these problems.  Complementary                          experimental methods and measurement facilities at the two                      laboratories allow the comprehensive investigation of linear                    and nonlinear response phenomena in the micro-and millimeter                    wave spectral range.  The small amplitude ac response can be                    monitored at UCLA over a substantial spectral range, while                      the nonlinear ac response is measured at Vienna at selected                     frequency.",
