The meeting will include the following                       areas: robot control, kinematics and dynamics, grasping,                        vision, sensing, sensor fusion, distributed processing,                         neural networks, task planning, mobile robots, unmanned                         vehicles, architecture for intelligent robots, robot                            programming languages, computational algebra and geometry,                      and applications of intelligent robots.  Several plennary                       sessions are planned, in addition to concurrent sessions                        for contributed and invited papers.                                                                                                                             Scope:  The meeting is sponsored by the Centre for                              Artificial Intelligence & Robotics of the Government of                         India, in cooperation with the Institute of Electrical and                      Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the Automation and Systems,                        Man and Cybernetics Societies, and the International                            Federation of Automatic Control.  Speakers and participants                     are expected from Japan, several European countries,                            Canada, Singapore in addition to the U.S. and India.  It is                     highly likely that the exchange of information will be                          useful to the U.S. and Indian scientists and that future                        cooperative research will result.",
