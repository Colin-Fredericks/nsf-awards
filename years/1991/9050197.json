 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project will develop nine unit (or approximately                ninety weeks) of supplementary science material target for grades               7-9 and organized around telecommunications-based, collaborative                student research.  The project involves coordinated curriculum                  and software development, formative and sumative research,                      dissemination and teacher training.  The work will be performed                 by TERC in collaboration with the National Geographic Society.                  NGS will match the NSF funding and act as co-developer, producer                and publisher.  Additional support for the inclusion of                         microcomputer-based lab material will come from IBM.                                                                                                            Each unit requires students to gather date, share these data over               a telecommunications network with students in other school                      districts and analyze the collected data.  This allows students                 to perform like scientists.  Before gathering the data, students                study the underlying science content and learn the experimental                 skills required to perform appropriate measurement.  Following                  the data collection, students apply data analysis techniques and                reflect on the social significance of the problem addressed in                  the study.  Study areas proposed include: Conditions for Growth,                Trees, Student Fitness, Acid Deposition, Recycling and                          Composting, Radon, Alternative Energy sources, Automobile                       Accidents, and Greenhouse Gasses.  Each unit will be carefully                  tried and tested in typical classrooms.                                                                                                                         User software will be developed that will improve upon that                     developed for the elementary NGS Kids Network, significantly                    extending the analysis possible using some database-like                        functions.  Host software will also be developed that simplifies                and speeds up the collection of data.",
