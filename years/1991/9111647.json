 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic analysis of trade policy has usually sought to explain                 trade intervention in terms of domestic objectives.  Tariffs and                quotas, for example, have been seen primarily as a response to                  protectionist pressures emerging directly from domestic groups                  perceiving themselves as benefiting from them.  But trade policy                is increasingly seen as a mechanism for enforcing international                 economic and environmental agreements.  For example, trade                      sanctions have been threatened as a means of enforcing                          international debt contracts and punishing nations that violate                 international environmental protocols.  This project rigorously                 analyzes the ability of national governments to use trade policy                as a way of influencing the policies of other sovereign nations.                                                                                                The ability of a government to exert external influence is                      investigated in the context of theories of dynamic strategic                    interaction.  The focus is not on the development of theoretical                methods per se, but on their application to the international                   economic order.  The project assesses the ability of existing                   multilateral and unilateral arrangements, such as GATT and U.S.                 trade law, and alternative arrangements to achieve objectives in                global environmental protection, trade policy, protection of                    intellectual property, and international banking.  Two specific                 questions are addressed: (1)  Does the cost, in terms of reduced                flexibility, of laws constraining the executive's pursuit of                    foreign policy outweigh any improved commitment vis-a-vis foreign               governments that such laws might impart?  (2)  In the presence of               asymmetric information about the national and global costs and                  benefits of environmental protection, should national                           environmental protection be rewarded, or should sanctions be                    imposed against polluters?",
