 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits the Center for American Archaeology (CAA) to                 improve the accessibility and condition of approximately one-                   quarter million documents, photographs and maps produced and                    acquired by them during archaeological investigations conducted                 from 1958-1977.  This large archive, housed at the CAA center in                Kampsville, Illinois, is widely used by archaeologists who work                 in the region and it has never been properly archived.                          Therefore, materials can be difficult to find and are subject to                deterioration through use.  With the assistance of two                          professional archivists, an initial records survey will be                      conducted.  Materials will be arranged and described by record                  type; indices and inventories will be produced.  The condition of               all records will be assessed and conservation measures carried                  out.  Documents and maps will be copied onto microfilm and                      microfiche and these working copies will greatly extend the                     lifespan of original records.                                                                                                                                   Over the last several decades, extensive archaeological research                has been conducted in the upper midwestern U.S. and the CAA has                 played a prominent role in this.  The prehistory of the region                  covers a span of ca. 12,000 years and shows how human societies                 adapted at different levels of technology to a changing post-                   glacial environment.  Within this area, early experiments in                    plant domestication took place and Native American chiefdoms                    arose.  For these reasons, the excellent CAA data base is of                    interest to large numbers of archaeologists.  Because of storage                and conservation conditions, however, the archive is difficult to               use and in danger of further deterioration.  This NSF award will                remedy these conditions.                                                                                                                                        This project is important because it will preserve important                    scientific data - much of it collected with U.S. government funds               - and make it available to the scientific community.",
