 "awd_abstract_narration": "The places where one stream flows into another are important               points in stream systems.  Abrupt changes in the velocity and direction         of water flow and in the shape and character of streambeds alter the            character of the streams and create distinctive ecological niches               within which certain species thrive and others are repelled.  Most              research on the geomorphic and ecological dynamics of stream                    confluences has been conducted in laboratories using flume experiments          or on computers using mathematical models.  Some field observations             have been made, but measurements usually have been limited to a few             variables.  This project will explore geomorphic and ecological                 processes empirically by taking detailed measurements of a wide range           of variables at the confluence of two streams of roughly equivalent             size in central Illinois.  These measurements will be used to determine         how temporal variations in the different rates of velocity for the two          merging streams affect interactions among flows, streambed morphology,          and sediment transport.  A related set of measurements of biotic                phenomena will be used to assess habitat conditions and to determine            how geomorphic characteristics of the confluence influence the                  structure and function of aquatic communities upstream and downstream           from the confluence.  Some members of the investigative team engaged in         field observations and data analysis will be undergraduate students             funded through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program.                  This research project is an intensive case study at a single site,         but the measurements collected at that site will provide a coherent             test of qualitative and mathematic models that have been developed in           laboratory and theoretical settings.  In addition to providing                  empirical tests of these models, the project also will contribute to            evaluation of the efficacy of methods to obtain detailed measurements           in settings like this.  The addition of the undergraduate students to           the project's research team will enhance the study and will provide             valuable experience for promising undergraduats.",
