 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fine, ultrapure, spherical particles are desirable starting                     materials for producing high performance afvanced ceramic                       products.  AeroChem has a unique flame synthesis process for                    preparing such high quality powders, including silicon                          nitride.  This process differs from the usual combustion                        synthesis in that no oxygen is used:  the particle-producing                    reactants also support the flame.  For silicon nitride,                         silane, ammonia, hydrazine, and nitrogen are burned on a flat                   flame burner.  A high quality powder is produced of which a                     sample, without additives, was successfully subjected to hot                    isostatic pressing.  However, the use of hydrazine makes the                    process commercially unacceptable because of the cost,                          explosive nature, and toxicity of hydrazine.  While                             thermodynamic and other considerations indicate that ammonia                    should support a flame without hydrazine present, we have not                   been able to operate without some hydrazine.  A computer                        modeling study is proposed to understand why the                                ammonia/silane system does not support a flame under the                        conditions which have been employed, and to define the                          conditions under which a flame could be supported.                              Experiments will then be performed to determine the practical                   feasibility of operating under the defined conditions.                          Successful completion of this program would make available for                                                                                                  advanced ceramic manufacture a higher quality powder than is                    currently available.                                                                                                                                            The final product of the proposed research would be an                          economical process for the preparation of a high quality                        silicon nitride powder for use in advanced ceramics.  Present                   progress in advanced ceramics is limited by the unavailability                                                                                                  of a US made high quality powder.",
