 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project attempts to expand our understanding of social and                 economic behavior in environments with imperfect information.  The              project consists of two main parts.  The first part of the project              examines clustering, while the second studies incomplete                        contracting.                                                                                                                                                    \"Clustering\" refers to situations in which people act similarly,                even though their preferences are different.  Examples include herd             behavior (for example, the formation of cultural or sub-cultural                standards of behavior), the common practice of dividing estates                 equally among heirs, and the proliferation of \"me too\" political                candidates.  This project explores a theory of clustering based on              two key assumptions: decision-makers desire popularity or esteem,               and actions are observable but true characteristics are not.  In                a class of mathematical models, these assumptions produce                       clustering of choices, even when true characteristics are not                   clustered.  This part of the study will lead to novel predictions               about consumption behavior in various markets.                                                                                                                  \"Incomplete contracting\" refers to the fact that contracts often                fail to cover many contingencies.  This project explores a theory               of incomplete contracts based on two assumptions: certain actions               are not observable by those who enforce contracts (for example,                 courts or arbitrators), and parties to a contract will interact                 again in the future.  In a class of mathematical models, these                  assumptions imply that parties to an explicit contract may leave                some provisions ambiguous in order to improve the implicit aspects              of their agreement.  This part of the study will provide insights               concerning why contracts leave out certain contingencies even when              including them does not seem very costly.",
