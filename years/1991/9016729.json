 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides partial support for 10                      U.S. scientists to participate in an International Workshop                     on Lasers in Science and Technology, scheduled to be held                       in Amman, Jordan, in October 1991.  The topics will involve                     laser radiation, and include: basic atomic, molecular and                       optical physics; atomic spectroscopy and applications;                          molecular spectroscopy of systems that are of importance to                     physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and biochemistry;                      laser-induced reactive and non-reactive chemistry, and                          photochemical processes; laser chemical analysis, and laser                     induced ionization and fluorescence; laser-produced                             plasmas; laser-surface interaction; small accelerator                           physics; and biomedical applications of lasers.  In                             addition to contributed scientific and technological                            papers, there will be a small number of talks of general                        character to suit the interdisciplinary audience.                               Participants are expected from the U.S., several European                       countries, India, Pakistan, China, the USSR, and all Arab                       countries as well as Iran and Turkey.  Proceedings of the                       workshop will be published.                                                                                                                                     Scope: The aims of the workshop include: (1) providing a                        forum for scientists and researchers from the region to                         present the results of their research and to hear from                          active foreign researchers about their recent work. (2)                         working by Arab and other Middle East scientists to plan                        for a laser research center with help from the expertise of                     U.S. and European participants. and (3) planning for                            collaboration between the U.S. and Middle East countries.                       These aims are well within the goals of the Science in                          Developing Countries Program.",
