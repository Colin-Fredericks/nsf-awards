 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves further investigation in the area of                 generation of test cases for NP-hard problems.  This area has to do             with the design of efficient algorithms to produce instances of NP-             hard problems with known answers, in such a way that the sets of                instances produced are useful for the empirical testing of                      approximation algorithms for these problems.                                         Previous work consisted of theoretical results concerning the              existence of different types of test case generators, and the design            of test case construction algorithms for certain NP-hard graph                  problems.  For the proposed research the overall goals are to improve           on the generation procedures, to expand their applicability, and to             gain more insight into the relationship between the instances                   generated by the procedures and the problem or application instances.           The project will include consideration of construction algorithms for           problems in different application areas; and the investigation,                 through both analytical and empirical means, of the effect of well-             known approximation algorithms on sets of generated instances.",
