 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for Dr. Bernard Bauer through the              National Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Program.          The objective of this program is to provide research support for some           of the nation's most outstanding and promising young science and                engineering faculty members.  The awards are intended to improve the            capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand for           highly qualified scientists and engineers for academic and industrial           research and teaching.                                                               This award will allow Dr. Bauer to continue his research in                geomorphic processes, especially the mechanisms by which fluids sculpt          landforms.  The investigator has been a leader in adapting models and           analytic techniques originally developed in coastal studies for use in          analyses of streams.  He will continue this synthetic research through          detailed explorations of the influence of wave-like fluid oscillations          within streams on stream banks, expanding on the unidirectional flow            models that currently form the basis for most models of channel                 morphology.  This research will include a series of experimental and            empirical analyses that focus on application to stream-channel erosion          and deposition of beach-equilibrium models, which include measurements          of wave height, steepness, skewness, and orbital velocity.  Time-series         analyses of data gathered by electromagnetic current meters and                 submersible pressure sensors will provide more accurate estimates of            the relative significance of oscillatory motions and unidirectional             flows on stream-channel erosion and deposition.  In addition to                 enhancing general understandings of fluid dynamics and channel                  morphology, this research will provide practical information for                analyses of the differential impacts of alternate discharge regimes             when stream flow is regulated by dams or other flow-control structures.",
