 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Wisconsin Madison for the renovation and repair of                facilities in two wings of the Engineering Building which house                 the research and research training activities of the Department of              Chemical Engineering.  These wings were constructed in 1953 and                 1962 and no major renovations have since been carried out.  The                 ARFMP grant of $600,000 and $950,620 provided by the grantee as                 cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve             the current research infrastructure in terms of health and safety               as well as of quality, quantity, and diversity of research that can             be performed by upgrading the fume hood/ventilation system.  This               renovation is essential to licensing that will permit the continued             use of radioactive materials which are involved in a great deal of              the chemical research conducted in the Chemical Engineering                     laboratories.                                                                                                                                                   This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                   graduate students.  The Department of Chemical Engineering at the               University of Wisconsin Madison is one of the world's foremost                  programs in this discipline, and it is one of the important                     producers of the nation's chemical engineers.",
