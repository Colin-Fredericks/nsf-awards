 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rare and endemic species provide unique opportunities to study                  the principles and processes of speciation.  The Streptanthus                   glandulosus complex (Cruciferae) is a group of serpentine                       endemics, most of which are rare or threatened.  This complex                   represents a particularly striking example of the role of                       substrate in the divergence of populations and taxa.  These                     annual plants occur on serpentine soils in disjunct populations                 in the Coast Ranges of California from Tehama County to San Luis                Obispo County, isolated by intervening regions of unsuitable,                   non-serpentine habitat.  this isolation, accompanied by                         inbreeding, may have resulted in the many different phenotypes                  identifiable among populations within each species.  The                        phylogeny of the group is unknown and taxonomic delimitations are               disputed: from three varieties of one species to 13 distinct                    species have been recognized.  Thus, the S. glandulosus complex                 not only requires systematic study but it also offers an                        excellent forum in which to study speciation processes in                       serpentine endemics.  Based on interpopulational crossing                       experiments, Kruckeberg (1957) showed a negative correlation                    between interfertility of populations of the complex and the                    distance by which they were separated.  We propose to build on                  Kruckeberg's classic studies of isolation by distance using a                   combination of enzyme electrophoresis and restriction site                      analysis of chloroplast DNA to examine genetic divergence,                      systematic relationships, and evolutionary processes.  The                      specific objectives are : (1) assess allozymic and cpDNA                        divergence among populations and correlate genetic divergence                   with geographic patterns; (2) construct a phylogeny of the                      complex using cpDNA restriction site data and use the phylogeny                 to evaluate putative examples of paleoendemism and neoendemism,                 recent derivation of restricted taxa from more widespread ones,                 and recurrent adaptation of serpentine tolerance; (3) estimate                  levels of interpopulational gene flow using allozymic data; and                 (4) compare levels of allozyme variability in restricted and                    widespread taxa.  The integration of interfertility, allozymic,                 and restriction site analyses of the S. glandulosus complex                     offers an almost unparalleled venus from which to study                         speciation processes, and will provide the information necessary                for sound management of the complex.",
