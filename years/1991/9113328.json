 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in Positive Political Economy.  The faculty group                is composed of 12 distinguished Political Scientists and                        Economists from the Government and Economics Departments and the                Kennedy School at Harvard University and from the Political                     Science and Economics Departments of the Massachusetts Institute                of Technology.  The funds will provide stipends for graduate                    students and postdoctoral trainees, purchase computers needed for               trainee research, aid with costs of trainee recruitment and                     provide part-time secretarial assistance.  Institutional                        commitments will aid in purchase of equipment and in other                      aspects of the group's                                                          efforts.                                                                                                                                                        Addressing issues and problems at the interface of political                    science and of economics, research in positive political                        economics shows, in general, how observed differences among                     institutions affect political and economic outcomes in various                  social, economic, and political systems, and how the institutions               themselves change and develop in response to individual and                     collective beliefs.  More rigorous than traditional political                   science and more concerned with nonmarket institutions than                     traditional economics, positive political economics focuses on                  how political and economic institutions constrain, direct and                   reflect individual behavior in attempting to explain social                     outcomes such as production, resource allocation and public                     policy.",
