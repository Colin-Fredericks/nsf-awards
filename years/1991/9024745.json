 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lope-Okanda Game Reserve, in central Gabon, is set in one of                the most species-rich tropical rainforests in the world, yet the                Reserve, in which is located the Station d'Etude des Gorilles et                Chimpanzes (SEGC), is virtually unknown botanically.  A knowledge               of the flora of this Reserve is important to the research on                    gorillas and chimpanzees and to general conservation work in the                Reserve.  This project will produce a checklist of the plants of                the area.  The project involves intensive collecting in the Reserve             during four periods of three months over two years.  This strategy              will ensure coverage of all phenological periods.  Because of the               network of roads within and near the Reserve, activity would be                 concentrated in two portions of the Reserve; along the western side             on the many roads and trails associated with the SOFORGA lumber                 company's work, and along the trail system radiating from the SEGC              research station near the northeastern corner of the Reserve.                   Field-collected specimens would be dried at the National Herbarium              of Gabon in Libreville and identified there as well as at the                   herbaria of the Missouri Botanical Garden and the Laboratoire de                Phanerogamie, Paris.  Information obtained from the Reserve                     specimens will be added to the TROPICOS botanical database at the               Missouri Botanical Garden, and a checklist will subsequently be                 derived.  The database, the checklist, and associated specimens                 will be of particular value in the production of Flore du Gabon,                commenced in 1961 by the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle,                  Paris, and now only one-third complete.",
