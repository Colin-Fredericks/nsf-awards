 "awd_abstract_narration": "The time-averaged (climatological) extra-tropical                          atmospheric flow shows a definite spatial arrangement of areas of               locally maximum variance (\"storm tracks\") located east of                       equatorward extending meanders (pressure trough) in the                         climatological jet-stream.  Van den Dool and Cai propose to study               the temporal variations of the flow which underlie this climatic                feature.  They posit a complementary inter-relationship between                 slowly-varying (\"low frequency\") planetary-scale waves and                      rapidly changing (\"high-frequency\") synoptic scale eddies.  This                would suggest that there exist traveling storm track regions                    downstream of traveling low-frequency waves, which are obscured                 in the time average.  In fact, they report on a pilot study which               demonstrates the existence of such regions in the mid-                          troposphere.  They used a novel analysis technique, which records               high-frequency activity in a frame which follows an identifiable                feature of the low-frequency flow as it travels about the mid-                  latitudes.  Having demonstrated the existence of traveling storm                tracks, they now propose extended analyses to elucidate the                     three-dimensional structures of both the low-frequency and high-                frequency features as seen in this moving (\"phase-transformed\")                 frame, and the symbiotic relationship between them.  The results                of the proposed study will form the basis of future attempts to                 extend detailed day-to-day weather forecasts out to ranges that                 exceed a week.",
