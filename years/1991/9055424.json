 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal offers a plan to enhance teacher content                          background and teaching strategy using an approach involving                    issues oriented science teaching and learning project.  There                   are four teacher enhancement units and four content                             enhancement units proposed for development and testing during                   the project.  The content enhancement units consist of topics                   such as, chemical reactions, toxicology for teachers, risk                      assessment and communication, and toxic waste.  In addition                     to the development and testing units, Leadership Enhancement                    Conferences will be held at the Lawrence Hall of Science                        during the summers of 1991, 1992, and 1993.                                                                                                                     Over a period of 31 months the project will provide 13 days                     of direct teacher development and leadership training to 70                     middle school teachers and one week of leadership training to                   35 instructional leaders associated with those teachers.                                                                                                        The goal of the project is to develop a system that can                         contribute to changing the way teachers teach science.  The                     project has the following objectives: (1) Develop, test,                        revise, produce, and disseminate a set of issue-oriented                        science teacher enhancement materials; (2) Establish, test,                     and revise a model that encourages leadership teams trained                     by the project to carry out substantive teacher enhancement                     activities related to the project's goals in their local                        districts; and (3) Help support and expand the impact of the                    project by attracting significant public and private sector                     funding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Cost sharing is equivalent to 20% of the NSF award.//",
