 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenomenon of earthquake fault rupture                                      propagation through overlying soils is quite                                    complex and is not well understood at this                                      time.  An improved understanding would assist                                   in siting and in designing critical facilities                                  constructed in regions where soils overlie                                      potentially active faults.  For example, a                                      number of earth dams have been constructed                                      over potentially active faults.  Furthermore,                                   significant ground movements can occur on                                       subsidiary fault planes several miles from the                                  main fault rupture.                                                                                                                                             The objective of this project is to develop                                     improved models and analytical procedures,                                      suitable for use by practicing engineers                                        investigating the effects of a boundary                                         displacement on overlying particulate media.                                    This investigation integrates knowledge in the                                  fields of geology, seismicity, numerical methods,                               physical modelling and geomechanics.                                                                                                                            Well-documented fault rupture case histories,                                   and the results from small-scale model tests,                                   can provide physical evidence of the                                            mechanism whereby a soil mass responds to an                                    underlying tectonic movement.  The aim is to                                    develop soil models, incorporating both pre-                                    failure and post-failure soil behavior, for                                     implementation within computational methods.                                    This includes the development of three-                                         dimensional procedures - which can be                                           validated by the three-dimensional physical                                     model tests - to study strike-slip fault                                        movements.  Given the inherent shortcomings                                     in applying a continuum-based approach to the                                   analysis of failure in a soil mass, discrete                                    element techniques require further                                              development.  Another goal is to support the                                    analytical procedures through an exploration of                                 methods for characterizing critical soil                                        properties, such as the hydraulic conductivity                                  along newly-formed shear fractures in earth                                     materials.",
