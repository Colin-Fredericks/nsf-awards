 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Zilm is supported by a grant for exploratory                       research from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to                    develop the NMR methods which would take advantage of the newly                 discovered optical polarization techniques for producing nearly                 perfectly spin-polarized Xe-129 nuclei in xenon gas.  In                        principle, the transfer of this polarization to nuclei in a                     molecule in a solid xenon matrix can be achieved for                            enhancement of the NMR signals by up to four orders of                          magnitude.  These novel experiments are expected to have high                   impact on the detection of orders of magnitude smaller                          concentrations of molecules in xenon matrix isolation.  This                    would mean that reactive species which are created in very                      small steady state quantities in a chemical reaction could be                   detected with NMR, providing detailed structural information.                   This would also mean that low sensitivity nuclei, such as                       naturally abundant carbon-13 and silicon-29 could be observed                   even at these low concentrations.                                               %%%                                                                             This exploratory research project will make use of the just                     discovered method of completely polarizing the nuclear spins in                 xenon by using the xenon to transfer polarization to other                      nuclei, thus enhancing their nuclear magnetic resonance spectra                 by ten thousand fold.  The preliminary experiments will                         determine the conditions that are necessary for the efficient                   polarization transfer. The xenon could be used as a solid                       matrix for the detection of very small amounts of reactive                      molecules and molecule fragments.  The xenon can also be laid                   down on a surface to allow the detection of only surface atoms.",
