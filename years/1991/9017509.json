 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurements of acoustic wave propagation beneath the seafloor                  provide critical data for understanding the physical properties                 of marine sediments and crustal rock. Such information can be                   used to examine the composition and alteration of such material.                Historically, most studies investigating the acoustic properties                have used either seismic or laboratory techniques. Although                     useful, such data is often inaccurate for extrapolating to                      significant depth in the sea-floor. With the advent of sonic                    logging in the Ocean Drilling Program, some high-resolution                     acoustic data has become available. Because of the complexity of                lithology, structure, geometry and available equipment, most                    measurements have only been able to determine compressional wave                variations.                                                                                                                                                     The present project would adapt and modify for use on the JOIDES                Resolution available industry equipment for measuring shear wave                velocities and waveforms. This in situ data can be combined with                routinely measured compressional velocities to completely                       characterize the acoustic properties of drilled sediments. The                  principal investigator is a promising young scientist who is                    fully qualified to undertake the proposed project. This award                   represents his first NSF research support.",
