 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate influences vegetation through its effects on fire                  regimes.  In order to understand how future climate changes will                alter global vegetation patterns, we must understand the role of                fire during times of rapid climate and vegetation change.  In                   this study, Dr. Clark will be determining the frequency of fires                at these times of rapid climate and vegetation change.  He will                 be coring lake sediments that contain fossil charcoal produced by               these fires.  Annual laminations in the sediments allow the                     investigator to determine in the age of this charcoal and to                    reconstruct the frequency of fires at these times.  These                       reconstructed fire regimes will be compared with vegetation and                 climate changes known from fossil pollen and other data.  These                 patterns will then be mapped across eastern North America to                    establish the spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence                  that prevailed when the climate was changing rapidly.  These                    results will help us to interpret the potential role of fire as                 climate changes in the near future.",
