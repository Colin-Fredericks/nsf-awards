 "awd_abstract_narration": "Profound economic and social changes over the past two decades have             put enormous pressures on American cities and led to reorganization             of local political arrangements.  Except for a few large cities,                however, these changes are uncharted and not well understood.                   Among the trends that have contributed to the crisis in urban                   governance are: 1) the decline in public money available for local              development projects, 2) the consequent erosion of regulations                  supporting representation of minority and neighborhood interests                in development activities, 3) the rise of a variety of new social               movements (e.g. environmentalism) based on shared values rather                 than ethnic or neighborhood identities, and 4) the shift of                     development decisions to non-electoral area.                                                                                                                    This research examines the interplay of these trend in eight                    little-studies American cities since 1980.  The research is framed              and interpreted in terms of urban regime theory and focuses of                  differences in the nature, extent, and scope of interest                        representation across different policy areas in these different                 cities over time.  Aggregate statistics will be supplemented with               intensive interviews with political elites and the leaders of local             interest groups and associations.                                                                                                                               When completed this research will provide a better understanding                of contemporary patterns of representation in American cities and               help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of alternative models             of urban governance.",
