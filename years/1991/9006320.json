 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will expand previous work on nest predation and               nest placement as influences on habitat selection, coexistence of               species, and reproductive investment.  Nest placement and nest                  predation have received relatively little attention in such                     topics and, thus, can increase our understanding of these topics                areas.  Plus, knowledge of ecological constraints on nesting                    success in critical to conservation of species because of the                   importance of reproductive success to population maintenance.                   Data on nesting success and associated habitat for more than 350                nest will be collected during two additional years under this                   renewal.  These data will be used to test hypotheses and                        predictions on nest patch choice and differences among coexisting               species.  Artifical nest will be used to conduct experimental                   tests of invasibility of communities as a function of evolved                   nest placement traits.  Researchers will study Hermit Thrushes                  nesting in the same substrate in two different habitats to                      examine effects of evolved nest placement on local nesting                      success (e.g.. \"source - sink\" effects).  Variability in nest                   placement will be examined within and among years and relative to               nest predation.                                                                 Effects of nest placement on nest attendance by females, feeding                and guarding of females by males, and feeding nestlings will be                 monitored.  Finally, differences among the coexisting species                   based on their foraging sites versus nesting sites will be                      compared.                                                                       Results will contribute to the basic ecology of avian communities               and to conservation biology of birds.                                                                                                                              //",
