 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oxygen is necessary for life on earth because it drives                    crucial aerobic life processes.  Ostensibly, oxygen also imposes                universal toxicity as its reactions in living cells generate                    hydrogen peroxide and highly reactive free radicals of oxygen.                  These toxic by-products of oxygen metabolism are responsible for                many deleterious processes such as peroxidation of essential                    lipids, alterations in genes, impaired protein synthesis and                    enzyme inactivation, aging and decrease in energy productions.                  Mammalian toxicologists have shown that several antioxidant                     enzymes are crucial for cell viability and organismal health,                   because they efficiently remove toxic oxygen products.                               Herbivorous insects constitute about half of the three-                    quarters of a million described species, and they are subject to                both endogenous and exogenous sources of oxygen toxicity.  The                  sources for exogenous oxygen toxicity are the pro-oxidant plant-                defensive compounds called allelochemicals.  A unique pattern of                antioxidant enzymes has been discovered in recent years in                      insects.  The proposed studies are designed to elucidate the role               of these enzymes in protecting insects against oxygen toxicity                  derived from pro-oxidant allelochemicals.  The long-term goal of                this research is to gain the necessary basic information on the                 interaction of insects with plants, such that environmentally                   compatible insect pest control techniques can be developed.",
