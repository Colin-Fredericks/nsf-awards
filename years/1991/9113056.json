Results of the workshop should help                         determine spatial extent and variations in environmental                        degradation and may prove useful in understanding                               effects on public health and economic productivity.                             Participants will also examine related governance and                           policy concerns along with issues of relevant research                          methodology and data adequacy for future joint efforts.                                                                                                         This cooperative geography workshop fulfills the program                        objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Central Europe                         to combine complementary talents and pool research                              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                                competence.",
