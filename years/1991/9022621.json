 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will research bifurcation of multiparameter                   families of nonlinear differential equations.  The primary  focus               is the analysis of bifurcations to periodic solutions.  In the                  autonomous case the bifurcation of limit cycles from centers and                from one parameter families of periodic solutions is considered                 while in the autonomous case bifurcation of subharmonic solutions               is studied.  A major goal is to develop an analysis that goes                   beyond the usual first order methods by being able to treat the                 response to a nonlinear perturbation to all orders.  This will                  allow for a complete understanding of the bifurcation diagram of                the multiparameter system by detecting periodic solutions which                 are invisible to first order methods and by mixing a priori                     information on the minimum order to which the perturbation                      analysis must be carried so as to exhaust the possibility of                    finding additional perturbed periodic solutions.  The methods                   employed include geometric analysis of nonlinear dynamics,                      perturbation theory, \"Andronov-Melnikov\" theory, and algebraic                  geometric ideal theory.  There is also an important computational               component especially integration of differential equations,                     computer graphics and computer algebra.                                              Applications of the theory are found wherever physical                     systems are modeled by nonlinear ordinary differential equations                depending on parameters and, in particular, when determining the                possible response of a nonlinear system to external stimuli.  A                 typical application is illustrated in the project by the analysis               of a wind oscillation problem.",
