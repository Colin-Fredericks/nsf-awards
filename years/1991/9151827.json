 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics is an important                    part of the undergraduate physics laboratory experience. AMO                    physics has the advantage over many other fields of current                     research of being accessible to undergraduates both                             theoretically and experimentally. The objective of the program                  here is to establish an undergraduate laboratory in this                        field.To develop a strong undergraduate laboratory program in                   AMO physics, several pieces of capital equipment and ancillary                  hardware are used.  The first major piece of equipment is a                     one-meter monochrometer, a device with innumerable uses in                      classical spectroscopy. It is used to introduce students to                     classical spectroscopic measurements. Second, two laser systems                 are used, one a pulsed laser system based on Nd:YAG pumped dye                  lasers, and the other a continuous wave semiconductor diode                     laser for use in modern atomic and molecular spectroscopy.                      Students can investigate both pulsed and cw spectroscopy to                     determine the fundamental relationship between the time and                     frequency domains.The spectroscopy equipment provides students                  with an opportunity to learn general principles of                              experimentation as well as introduce them to specific atomic                    phenomena.",
