The meeting will bring together                                   mathematicians from both countries who have made                                leading contributions to some of the most promising                             aspects of algebraic group theory for the purpose                               of fostering further progress through new long-                                 range cooperative research projects.  The Soviet                                Union and the United States are among the world                                 leaders in this important branch of mathematics.                                                                                                                This project fulfills the program objective of                                  advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                              researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to                            combine complementary efforts and capabilities in                               areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the                           field of basic scientific research on the basis of                              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
