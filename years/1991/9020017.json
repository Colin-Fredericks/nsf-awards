The researchers intend to                          concentrate upon maps between classifying spaces of                             compact Lie groups which are central to many branches of                        mathematics and play a fundamental role in theoretical                          physics. There is already considerable cooperation                              amongst the various participants involved in this                               proposal and number of joint publications have been                             produced.  Their continued efforts should yield further                         detailed information on the properties of the classifying                       spaces of compact Lie groups and the various algebraic                          structures associated with them.                                                                                                                                This project in mathematics research fulfills the                               program objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by                         enabling leading experts in the United States and                               Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                        research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                           and competence.",
