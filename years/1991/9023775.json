 "awd_abstract_narration": "For a few decades after Robert Oppenheimer's 1939 announcement of               the probable existence of \"neutron stars\", the field of neutron                 star astronomy was arguably held back by a lack of understanding                of what such objects would look like if astronomers on Earth looked             in their direction.   Studies have found that nonmagnetic neutron               stars reveal their presence by emitting high energy radiation in                response to primarily matter falling onto them from an orbiting                 companion star.  The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes a series              of theoretical investigations that would predict the radiation                  emitted a matter-accretion process.  He suspects that the response              is reponsible for the pulses of x-ray and gamma ray radiation                   recently detected by balloon and space-borne high energy                        experiments.  The PI hopes to confirm or refute this idea by his                modeling of what these \"signatures\" of a brief radiation-driven                 wind would look like.  He anticipates further that these events can             be used to estimate the masses and radii of neutron stars directly,             which has not been possible up to now.  In addition, he points out              that a knowledge of high energy signatures from accretion events                may be essential in the interpretation of data from several x- and              gamma-ray space missions now being planned.  Finally, the PI wishes             to examine the spiralling in of neutron stars in decaying orbits                around one another.  This process would proceed so fast (within                 seconds) that it can be fairly described as a \"neutron star                     collision\".  Much of the gravitational energy liberated in a                    collision would be emitted in a brief burst of gravitational                    radiation.  It is possible that such events could be a major source             of any gravitational radiation detected on Earth.  ***//",
