 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to determine the causes               and consequences of the shift by a plant parasitic fungus to new                plant species that it could not infect previously.  The                         investigator will conduct several experiments designed to                       determine whether the shift to new host species resulted from                   genetic changes in the fungi or the plants, or whether the shift                occurred independently of genetic changes.  Preliminary results                 suggests that genetic changes in the fungi allow them to infect                 additional host species.  In addition, he will investigate how                  the new fungal/plant combinations are adapting to each other                    compared with the old combinations, particularly whether the                    fungus differs in its pathogenicity on the new host species.                         This research has important basic and applied significance.                Most previous research on host/parasite interactions has                        considered association that are historically ancient.  Little                   research has considered biological interactions between host and                parasite in the early establishment of the relationship when                    important evolutionary changes are likely to occur.  This                       research will provide significant information about this early                  stage.  The research will also have important applied                           significance in understanding how disease organisms gain the                    ability to infect new host species that previously were                         resistant to infection.  The movement of the AIDS virus from                    primates to humans is an example of how significant this process                can be.  Because the host plants in this study are grasses, our                 most important group of agricultural plants, this research will                 aid in understanding and perhaps preventing disease epidemics in                crop grasses like corn, rice, and wheat.",
