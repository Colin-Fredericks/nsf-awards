 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Minority Research Initiation award supports the                       research in algebraic geometry of Professor Ronald Biggers of                   Kennesaw College.  Dr. Bigger's project is to make a computer-                  aided attack on a number of basic problems in the theory of                     moduli of algebraic curves.  The results that he aims for are of                considerable interest and importance in themselves, but a                       byproduct of his work will be a package of routines for computing               in group theory that will be of use to other mathematicians as                  well.                                                                                This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one that has had a                  revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                    origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field                makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical computer science and in robotics.",
