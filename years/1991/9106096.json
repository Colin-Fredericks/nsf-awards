 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to expand research                          capabilities and opportunities in physiology, including                         neuroscience, at Meharry Medical College.  This expansion                       will center on a multifaceted research and training program                     organized along the theme of cellular communication.  The                       proposed research-centered program will focus on fundamental                    questions associated with communication within and among                        cells.  The proposed program aims to accomplish the                             following:  1) To enhance the development of a core                             neurochemistry laboratory equipped to handle such                               neurochemical procedures as cellular/subcellular                                fractionations and in vivo sampling, neuroactive substance                      delivery, and sensitive quantitative analysis; 2) To                            contribute to the improvement of a research environment                         conducive to effective collaborative interactions; and 3) To                    provide additional training opportunities for minority                          graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  Four detailed                      projects are presented as core cellular communication                           projects.  These core projects will be heavily served by the                    expanded core neurochemistry laboratory.  Additional brief                      project descriptions are included as further examples of                        research to be served by the expanded core neurochemistry                       laboratory.",
