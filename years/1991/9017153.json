 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the distribution, use, and extension of a               new neural network simulation tool, referred to as GENESIS                      (General NEural SImulation System).  GENESIS has been developed                 by the principal investigator to build realistic models of                      biological neural systems.  The large interest in using                         simulations to studying the nervous system also makes it more                   important that the system be supported, enhanced and extended.                  One approach to this support is the design of GENESIS based                     tutorials that both demonstrate the use of the simulation system                and, at the same time, provide educational tools for                            understanding how neural simulations are structured and                         constructed.  This is an important aspect of the current award.                 From a technical point of view, because GENESIS makes use of                    state of the art approaches to computer simulation platforms and                graphics interfaces, further software development will provide                  exciting opportunities for expansion of the systems capabilities.               This award will support the porting of the software system to                   parallel computers which have the potential to provide                          significant increases in the computing power for simulations.                   This award will also support the development of broadly based                   GENESIS users group communicating over computer networks.  With                 this capability, researchers will be able to interact even in                   real-time while developing simulations and associated tools.                    Taken together, this award will provide the support necessary for               the distribution and extension of a valuable tool for                           computational neurobiology.  It will support general education in               the use of simulation techniques as well as the development of                  communication between different research groups interested in                   computational approaches to understanding the nervous system.",
