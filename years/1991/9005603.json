 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1987, under the directorship of Dr. John Stachel, Princeton                  University Press produced volume one of The Collected Papers of                 Albert Einstein,\" including the Einstein's writings and                         correspondence from 1879 to 1902.  This volume was especially                   important because of the discovery and publication of the                       correspondence between the young Einstein and his fellow student                and first wife, Mileva Maric.  Volume two, begun under Dr. Stachel,             was published in 1990 under the editorship of Dr. Martin Klein.                 This volume included Einstein's publications from 1901 to 1909,                 among them a number of works that were absolutely crucial in the                development of 20th century science. Both volumes were accompanied              by an English translation produced under the direction of Dr. Peter             Havas.                                                                                                                                                          With this three year grant, Dr. Martin Klein, with Drs. Jurgen Renn             and Robert Schulmann, will complete the preparation of volumes 3                through 7 of the Collected Papers.  Volumes 3, 4, 6 & 7 will                    present Einstein's writings from 1910 to 1922.   These papers                   include Einstein's work on his General Theory of Relativity.                    Volume 5 will present Einstein's correspondence from 1902 to 1914.              This grant will also support the preparation of the accompanying                English translation of these volumes.  Dr. Klein is assuming                    responsibility for the translation as well as the edition.                                                                                                      At the end of the three year period, it is the hope of the                      Princeton University Press to have raised an endowment to complete              the publication of 29 volumes of Einstein papers.  This project                 will continue well into the second decade of the next century.                  In the meantime, researchers will be actively working on these                  papers.  NSF is pursuing additional ways of expediting this                     research.",
