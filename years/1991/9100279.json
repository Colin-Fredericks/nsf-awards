 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards supports the research of Professor G. Kempf to                 work in algebraic geometry.  He will study the syzygies of                      homogeneous coordinate rings, matrices on Picard bundles of                     algebraic curves, and moduli of Abelian varieties.                                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the             oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the              point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have             stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures defined in the             plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.  Today, the             field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis                and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those                    fields.  Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse              as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding                  theory and robotics.",
