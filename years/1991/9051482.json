 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Computer-Integrated Process Engineering Laboratory is                         established that uniquely incorporates computer integrated                      engineering concepts into the undergraduate curriculum by                       providing 'hands on' experience with modern instrumentation and                 control systems, databases statistical analysis methods and                     computer-aided engineering tools as they apply to the operation,                analysis and design of industrial processes.  A networked cluster               of engineering workstations and realtime database servers                       interfaced with on-campus utility systems serves as a generic                   platform for studying the application of computer integrated                    manufacturing concepts in the process industries.  The real-                    world, on-campus utility data base coupled with state-of-the-art                computer software/hardware tools is an effective environment for                studying approaches to defining and solving problems in product                 quality and process productivity improvement.  Additional utility               and  relevance of the laboratory include: focusing attention on                 problem areas of national technical and economic importance -                   energy and competitiveness; being readily reproducible - almost                 all campuses have utility systems; and, potentially providing                   direct economic benefits to universities utility cost reductions.",
