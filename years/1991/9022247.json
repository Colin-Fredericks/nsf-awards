 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation (NSF) support, Drs. Edward                     Schortman, Patricia Urban and their colleagues have conducted                   archaeological survey and excavation in the Naco Valley in                      Honduras.  This work has revealed the presence of a complex                     prehistoric polity which flourished during the first millennium                 A.D.  The central site of La Sierra contains large numbers of                   both monumental platforms as well as smaller constructions.  The                surrounding region also has many of sites, all significantly                    smaller than La Sierra itself.  This suggests that La Sierra                    represents the capital of a state level polity which encompasses                the entire Naco valley and possibly extends beyond these                        physiographic limits.                                                                                                                                           Continuing NSF support will permit the team to analyze the wide                 range of materials recovered.  The goal is to examine the floral                and faunal remains, the ceramic and other cultural objects as                   well as other skeletal material to gain insight into the                        political mechanisms which permitted stratification and                         centralization to develop.  The investigators believe that the                  economic system was controlled by the elite and organized in such               a way to maintain this domination.  This, it appears, extended                  both to local craft production as well as importation of                        specialized commodities.                                                                                                                                        The research is important for several reasons.  First, it will                  increase our understanding of how complex societies develop, are                maintained and eventually collapse.  The project will also                      provide data from a relatively unknown area and these will be of                interest to a large number of archaeologists.  Finally, because                 the research is based at an undergraduate institution and                       students will be taken into the field, it will provide a                        firsthand introduction to how science is conducted and hopefully                encourage these individuals to pursue careers in this area.",
