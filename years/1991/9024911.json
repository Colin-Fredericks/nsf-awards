The                 program is targeted at minority students, faculty, and                          professionals with interest in aquatic sciences as well as                      at majority faculty working at Historically Minority Colleges and               Universities (HMCUs).                                                                The proposed activities include: free membership in ASLO                   and support to attend annual meetings for three years;                          pre-meeting workshop to prepare attendees for active                            participation in the meeting; and special sessions during the                   meetings for HMCU representatives to make presentations.                             The combined efforts of an HMCU and a professional                         society should provide an effective mechanism to attract                        minority students and get them actively interested and involved                 in scientific research and in professional society activities.",
