 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microprocessors in mechanical engineering education are ready to                move beyond personal computer based control and data acquisition                to mechatronics:  a blend of mechanical design and electronics                  which stresses breadboard design of microprocessors and support                 chips.  The logical niche for mechanical engineers is the                       microcontroller or microcomputer-on-a-chip.  These chips are the                basis for modular control in product design:  automobiles,                      appliances, cameras, etc.                                                                                                                                       The purpose of this project is to establish a microcontroller                   laboratory concurrent with a required course on microprocessors.                The present laboratory uses microprocessor board designs which                  concentrate on bus oriented wiring.  Microcontrollers have memory               and I/O onboard.  Wiring problems are reduced to peripherals.                   This allows the additional time to teach computer assembly of                   microcontroller programs, to strengthen the peripheral designs                  but with microcontrollers, and to place more course emphasis on                 interfacing stepper and DC motors.                                                                                                                              The laboratory equipment would consist of twelve work stations.                 Each student would have a microcontroller development board to                  interface a personal computer for program assembly, software                    simulation, and program downloading to the microcontroller.  Six                oscilloscopes and three logic analyzers would provide for                       hardware and software debugging.",
