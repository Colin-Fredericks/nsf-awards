 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new Materials Research Group is established to investigate the                chemical and michromechanical processes that control crack growth               at elevated temperatures, and to quantify the stochastic aspects                of the crack growth response.  The goal of the investigation is                 to provide fundamental scientific understanding of the                          microstructural mechanisms for growth of cracks at elevated                     temperatures.  Polycrystalline nickel-iron-chromium ternary                     alloys with varying carbon content are being used for the                       experimental studies.  The role of grain boundary carbide or                    carbon concentration, as well as grain boundary orientation and                 structure upon cavitation segregation and crack growth kinetics                 are being determined.  The specimens are being grown by vacuum                  melting, forging, rolling of single heats of each alloy.                        Bicrystals of the same alloys are being grown by a modified                     Bridgeman method for the purpose of producing high angle grain                  boundaries of known orientation.  Materials characterization is                 being accomplished using analytical transmission electron                       microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, x-ray microprobe                       analysis, Laue back-reflection x-ray, and optical microscopy.                   Mechanical testing includes constant-load, tensile creep tests in               vacuum or high purity argon on polycrystalline and bicrystalline                specimens as a function of stress and environment (e.g.,                        temperature, hydrogen, water vapor, methane, and oxygen).  The                  steady-state creep deformation is being modeled as a function of                stress, strain, and temperature.  The models are addressing the                 mechanistic aspects of deformation (e.g., dislocation glide vs.                 climb, grain boundary sliding vs climb).  The kinetics of                       chemical reactions and transport processes are being determined                 their effects upon the enhancement of cavitation and creep crack                growth in these alloys.  The micromechanical model is being                     integrated with the chemically-based model to form a predictive                 model for environmentally-assisted creep crack growth.  In                      addition to the deterministic model, stochastic modeling of the                 factors that are probabilistic in nature are being incorporated                 to formulate a comprehensive model.  Factors being considered in                the probabilistic portions are cavity spacing, cavity growth                    rate, sintering and coalescence of cavities, grain boundary                     orientation, distribution of carbide precipitates.",
