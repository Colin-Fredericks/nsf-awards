 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to support a summer REU program to be                 held in the Department of Biomedical Sciences (BMS) of the State                University of New York at Albany's School of Public Health.  The                participating faculty members in this department are also                       Research Scientists within the Wadsworth Center for Laboratories                and Research (WCL&R) of the New York State Health Department.                   The WCL&R is a unique laboratory with state-of-the-art                          facilities, in which basic research programs have developed                     alongside mission-oriented public health laboratories.  The                     research interests of the participating BMS faculty cover a broad               range, with emphasis in molecular genetics and structural                       biology.  Ten undergraduate students interested in research                     careers will be recruited from colleges in the Northeast and from               historically Black colleges in the South.  Recruitment of under-                represented minority students will be assisted by the Director of               the Office of Minority Affairs, as part of this University's                    ongoing initiative in the area of minority graduate education.                  Laboratory projects in basic biological research topics will be                 chosen that are interesting, likely to yield results within the                 time-frame of the program, and allow for some degree of student                 development and independence.  Weekly group meetings will be used               to discuss science- and career-related issues and to monitor                    student progress.  The students will be asked to make both                      written and oral presentations to stress the importance of                      communication skills within science.",
