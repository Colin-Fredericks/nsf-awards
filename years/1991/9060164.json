 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paradigm Development Group, Ltd. has developed a                           software package that incorporates the most successful and                      widely accepted techniques of structured decision making.                       This software uses an integrative graphical model, which is                     intially expanded (problem structuring) and then contracted                     (analytical structuring) prior to analysis via quantitative                     models.  This decision aiding process will logically and                        rationally assist the decision-maker in examining all aspects                   of complex, ill-structured or partially defined problems.                            This research will test the problem structuring elements                   of this package by presenting it, in various forms, to four                     groups of small business people.  These business people share                   a common complex problem and need to develop strategic and                      operational plans to address this problem.  One group will                      receive the basic problem definition capability of the                          software (textual queries and compilation of problem                            constructs).  A second group will receive brainstorming                         support in addition to the problem definition support.                          Cognitive mapping and related queries (e.g., repertory grid)                    plus problem definition support will be provided to the third                   group.  The fourth group will complete the task with pencil                     and paper.  The results will be based on a weighted                             evaluation of the number of options generated by each group.                    Previous research has shown that the value of such support                      depends on its content and format.  The results of this                         research will be useful to Paradigm Development Group and all                   other researchers in devising decision support softwware.                       This prototype research will lead to a refined problem                          structuring software package available for the personal                         computer.  This product will provide the small business                         person and individual decision maker in industry and                            government with a competitive advantage in the marketplace.",
