 "awd_abstract_narration": "A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) with a mass                       selective detector is to be purchased with this equipment                       grant.  This will compliment and enhance existing analytical                    capabilities within the chemical engineering department, with                   specific applications to research on the combustion of                          chlorinated liquid and solid fuels aimed at gaining an                          understanding of the formation and destruction of intermediate                  products including dioxins and furans.  The specific                            objectives are to acquire kinetic data on PCDD/PCDFs in                         spouted-bed and fixed-bed reactors in order to understand                       accepted formation mechanisms better; to elucidate the role of                  temperature residence time, precursor partial pressure, and                     particle size on rates and yields; to model these processes;                    and to identify the steps and parameters that require more                      intensive study.                                                                                                                                                The GC/MS will greatly improve the ability to provide                           quantitative analyses of many samples.  This in turn will                       enhance the likelihood that relationships to probable                           precursors can be better understood, and from that knowledge                    the role of certain operation and design parameters on                          products of incomplete combustion in actual incinerators can                    be addressed.",
