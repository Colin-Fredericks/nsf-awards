 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award allows the investigator to pursue her research spanning              the areas of interpersonal conflict, decision making, groups and                social memory.  She combines central ideas from cognitive                       psychology and social cognition into the study of interpersonal                 conflict to create a new perspective in conflict research.  In her              work, Dr. Thompson addresses why negotiators often enter disputes               assuming:                                                                       (1) the payoffs to different parties are zero-sum, and                          (2) that the other party's interests are incompatible with their                    own.                                                                        Wrongly assuming that the sum of all the gains plus all the losses              is zero, negotiators can end up with sub-optimal outcomes.  This                award will support Dr.Thompson in carrying out laboratory studies               on negotiation behavior, and community-based research to establish              the external validity of laboratory research findings and to                    explore methods for producing more effective conflict resolution                in real social groups.  Dr. Thompson's work has been and will                   continue to be very effective in developing theory and insights                 for the pervasive and important problem of improving interpersonal              conflict resolution.",
