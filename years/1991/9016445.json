 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation improvement award is for a project to test                    effects of fish predation on the structure of benthic                           invertebrate communities in streams.  Direct and indirect effects               of predatory fish on invertebrate behavior and on dispersal are                 the major components of this research.                                                                                                                          Field sampling will provide background information on                           relationships between the distributions of fish, drifting and                   benthic invertebrates.  Field manipulation of fish density in                   enclosed sections of stream will test effects of fish on drift                  behaviour and dispersal.  A further manipulation will test the                  effect of fish on benthic community composition in the absence of               replenishment by drift from upstream.                                                                                                                           Experiments in a laboratory stream will test hypotheses about                   behavioural interactions between fish and invertebrates.  These                 interactions will be filmed and recorded on video cassette for                  analysis.  Researchers will investigate details of the predatory                behaviour of fishes in the context of their effect on                           invertebrate behaviour.  In addition, the research will test                    behavioural responses of invertebrates in the benthos and drift                 to fish and the cues used by invertebrates to detest the presence               of fish.  The research will contribute to the conceptual basis of               stream ecology and to the information base useful in stream                     fisheries management.",
