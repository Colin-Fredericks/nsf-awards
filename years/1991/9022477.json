 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the acquisition of a high performance                    spectrum analyzer. The analyzer will be used for interdisciplinary              projects at UCSD involving lightwave components and system                      research, including in particular (a) massively parallel                        architectures for terabit packet switched photonic communication                networks, (b) high frequency RF optical links (c) study of high                 frequency optoelectronic sample and hold circuits (c) planar,                   monolithic, and array integration of high performance photonic                  devices. These research projects, based on a synergy between                    optoelectronic device and network architectures, will lead to                   higher performance fiber optic communication networks.                               As the demands on networks and communications become ever                  greater with the advent of new applications such as animated                    visualizations and the necessity for the transfer of large amounts              of data over networks arising from supercomputer outputs, it is                 becoming necessary to vastly increase the capacity to transmit and              receive information. A particularly attractive transmission media               is light which has an enormous capacity for transmitting data. The              research supported by the acquisition of the high performance                   spectrum analyzer is in areas necessary for the realization of                  networks transmitting and receiving information at rates more than              1,000 billion bits/second. It includes both combined                            electrical/optical circuit research and research on protocols for               routing packets of information through the network.",
