 "awd_abstract_narration": "Field work in the last decade has led to the discovery of Plio-                 Quaternary eruptions of potassium- and water-rich basic lavas in                the fore-arc region of the western Mexican Volcanic belt (Fig.                  (Fig. 2), contemporary with the main calc-alkaline andesitic                    central volcanoes.  The association of this volcanism with                      rifting, both within and at the margin of the Jalisco block                     (Fig. 2), may have general implications for the magmatic and                    tectonic regimes along a continental convergent margin.  This                   project will investigate the relationships between tectonism,                   distribution of volcanic centers, magma output rates, and                       compositional diversity in order to gain a better understanding                 of the extent and scale of the heterogeneity of magma source                    regions, as well as the factors which influence the ascent and                  eruption of magma.  The proposed field work will focus on                       volcanism in a 50,000 km2 region in central Mexico, particularly                the Valley of Mexico.  This region contains over 400 monogenetic                cones, flows, and other eruptive centers about which little is                  known.  A comprehensive study of the temporal and spatial                       distribution of this volcanism is a crucial constraint on models                of magma genesis and diversification.  This region is also one                  of the most densely populated in Mexico so that the assessment of               volcanic hazards, which the P.I.s will conduct in collaboration                 with Mexican scientists at UNAM, will contribute to its                         significance.",
