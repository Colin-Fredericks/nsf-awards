 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on a concept for                           removing organic contaminants from soil using                                   microorganisms with natural ability to attack the organic                       compounds adsorbed on soil particles and to determine                           whether biological degradation could be enhanced by                             presence of surfactants.  The investigator plans on                             establishing a defined model system consisting of a                             naphthalene saturated soil and an organism known to                             efficiently degrade this compound.  He then plans to                            evaluate the effects of synthetic surfactants on their                          ability to degrade this compound and to determine whether                       bacteria known to produce surfactants could be utilized in                      place of the synthetic surfactants to accomplish the same                       end result more efficiently and effectively.                                                                                                                    This proposal was submitted in response to Program                              Announcement NSF 88-99, Research Initiation Awards.                             Results are expected to improve the engineering design of                       biologically-based remediation, potentially coupled to                          chemical and/or physical systems for removing contaminants                      from soil that are likely contaminants of groundwater.",
