 "awd_abstract_narration": "A combination of field, petrographic, and isotopic work has                identified 2 horizons in Precambrian carbonate strata (800 m.yr.                Beck Spring Dolomite, CA. and 1200 m.yr. Mescal Limestone, AZ)                  which were silicified during Precambrian erosion events.                        Microfossils have been discovered in chert samples from these                   horizons by R Horodyski and represent the first fossil record of                organisms that inhabited the Precambrian land surface.  Carbon                  isotope measurements in the associated carbonate reveal that the                land surface was extensively occupied by a terrestrial                          photosynthesizing community.  The microfossils in the chert are                 therefore probably not isolated examples but are elements of this               extensive community.  An attempt will be made to establish the                  first paleontologic record for the Precambrian terrestrial                      environment.                                                                         Field, isotopic, and petrographic work will establish the                  paleoenvironmental conditions of the paleokarst horizons and will               establish, in detail, which silica phases formed during Precambrian             weathering as opposed to those which formed during early diagenesis             of the original marine carbonates.  Cherts with strong textural and             geochemical characteristics indicative of subaerial formation will              be examined in thick petrographic sections for the presence of                  microfossils.  The biogenicity of microstructures will be                       evaluated, and an effort will be made to establish biologic                     affinities for any microfossils found.  Particular attention will               be given to comparing microfossils associated with the exposure                 surfaces with those in the underlying marine cherts to establish                that the microfossils found associated with the exposure surfaces               truly represent microorganisms that were living in a terrestrial                setting.",
