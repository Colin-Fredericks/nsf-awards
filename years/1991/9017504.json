 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three-year experimental, theoretical and field study of               convective instability and its role in solute mixing during mass                transport.  Instabilities can develop at different scales under a               variety of geologic and hydrogeologic situations when more dense                groundwater overlies less dense groundwater.  The process mixes                 the two waters to reduce the density stratification.  The                       specific objectives of the study are to describe the dynamics of                instability development both conceptually and mathematically and                to evaluate the potential for instability development to                        influence the chemical evolution of groundwater in large flow                   systems.  The study includes both experiments and the evaluation                of an actual groundwater system, the Milk River artesian aquifer,               in which unstable mixing has a significant potential for                        influencing the chemical evolution of the water.  The laboratory                work will involve a series of precisely controlled and monitored                flow tank studies designed to describe the dynamics of the mixing               process.  The field study will involve a detailed                               characterization of the geology and hydrogeology of the Milk                    River aquifer, followed by an evaluation with a variable density                model.  This study will contribute basic knowledge about a                      relatively unknown and poorly understood process.  Previous                     studies show that mixing due to instability development can be                  more important than commonly realized.  The work is of practical                and academic importance to problems of solvent-enhanced oil                     recovery, chemical mixing in sedimentary basins and contaminant                 migration.",
