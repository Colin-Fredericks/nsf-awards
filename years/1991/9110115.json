 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore the role of the context provided by                  one sentence in recognition of the words in the following                       sentence during silent reading.  The experiments will investigate               specific characteristics of the preceeding sentence context that                might influence the recognition of individual words during                      reading.  Skilled adult readers will read simple sentences                      presented on a computer screen, and their eye movements will be                 recorded as they read.  The research will use information from                  their eye movements and the time they take to name each word to                 determine the influence of the context in which a word occurs on                the identification of that word.  The purpose of the research is                to develop a more complete model of how words are identified                    during skilled reading and to further our understanding of the                  reading process in general.  By understanding skilled reading, we               will be better equipped to evaluate reading disability, to assist               dyslexic and disabled readers trying to cope with their reading                 problems, and to design methods of reading instruction and                      remediation.",
