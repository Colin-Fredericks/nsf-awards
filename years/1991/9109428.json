 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reliable information about the in-place early-age strength of                   concrete can be used to improve the safety and economy of concrete              construction.  For example, reliable measurements of in-place                   concrete strength can be used to determine when adequate strength               has been obtained to allow removal of shoring, transfer of                      prestressing, application of post-tensioning, and termination of                curing.  In-place strength information allows each of these                     operations to proceed safely and at the earliest possible time,                 leading to more economical construction. The objective of the                   proposed research is to continue development of a new test method,              the impact-echo method, for measuring in-place early age concrete               strength.  In this study, the impact-echo method will be                        established between P-wave velocity and concrete strength.  This                correlation relationship will be established using cylindrical                  concrete specimens is applicable to plate-like concrete structural              elements such as slabs and walls.  This work represents an                      advancement towards the development of a standardized test for                  measuring the in-place strength of concrete using the impact-echo               method.",
