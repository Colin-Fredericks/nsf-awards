 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) project is located at the              Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre in England.  This award                  from the Division of Chemistry, Office of Special Projects will                 provide approximately 25 percent of the support for access to this              database by U.S. scientists from the academic, government, and                  not-for-profit research communities.  This contribution will be                 transferred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as the                   Foundation becomes a co-supporter of the CSD.  The U.S. has over                1600 crystallographers who are potential users of this database.                                                                                                The CSD contains the most comprehensive collection of evaluated                 crystallographic data in the world.  Data for about 80,000 organic              and organometallic crystal structures  were included in the CSD as              of January, 1991.  Atomic coordinates, chemical connectivity                    tables, bibliographic data fields including reference sources for               the data, and coordinates for chemical structure diagrams for each              molecule are part of the system.  Software for search, retrieval,               and analysis of the data will be supplied as well as any                        improvements and updates of the software.  About 8000 new crystal               structures will be added to the data base yearly.  Thus this                    international resource will remain accessible to crystallographic               community and other users in the U.S. through the joint support of              NSF and NIH.",
