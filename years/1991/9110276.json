 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies the feasibility of using free-space optics                to interconnect large, monolithic arrays of electronic processing               elements (PEs), fabricated at or near the wafer scale, into                     topologies that are commonly characterized as having \"high wire                 area\".  Two long-standing problems are addressed in this project.               (1) Conventional approaches to wafer-scale integration must forfeit             considerable area to provide defect tolerance in the form of                    redundant or programmable interconnects and a sufficient density                of spare PEs.  (2) The poor performance of cross-wafer electrical               interconnects and the dominance of wire area in the 2-D layout of               highly connected topologies strongly favor mesh-like, essentially               two-dimensional, locally connected networks.                                                                                                                    In this research, electronic PEs are provided with optical inputs               for all signals entering or leaving the PE.  Light signals emitted              perpendicularly from the substrate constitute the input to an                   imaging system which, by virtue of specifically designed                        diffractive elements, realizes a mapping from the optical source                locations to the detector locations that implements the desired                 interconnect.  Because inter-PE connection are optical, the                     additional complexity required to support defect tolerance is                   absorbed into the imaging system instead of the circuitry.  Areas               of investigation include systems and architectural aspects of                   optically interconnected parallel machines, optimal design                      procedures and fabrication technology for diffractive elements,                 technology for light modulators on silicon, and imaging system                  engineering.  A prototype system comprising a butterfly machine for             computing fast transforms will serve as an experimental vehicle for             investigation of technological and systems aspect of optically                  interconnected wafer-scale processor arrays.",
