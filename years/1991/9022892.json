 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors Douglas K. Lilly and John M.                     Lewis of the Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological                 Studies (CIMMS), University of Oklahoma, to collaborate with                    Dr. Hartmut Kapitza and others of the GKSS National Research                    Center, in Geesthacht, Germany.  The objective of their                         collaboration is to apply the principles of optimal control to                  improve the modelling of mesoscale phenomena and to improve the                 manner in which models and data are matched.  In particular,                    they will work on extending a promising new technique called                    the \"adjoint\" method, that was originally developed by Dr.                      Karpita.  He and his colleagues at GKSS have special expertise                  in modeling that is well matched by the U.S. group's expertise                  in the use of data from new observational systems being                         introduced in the U.S. that include sophisticated ground-based                  remote sensing techniques.  The U.S. group will be able to help                 scientists at the GKSS to introduce realistic mesoscale data                    into the model, while research in data assimilation at CIMMS                    will benefit greatly from the opportunity to use the model and                  its adjoint on a variety of mesoscale meteorological problems.                                                                                                  Deterministic models used in mesoscale meteorology are among                    the most complicated used in science today.  The physical                       scales that must be included in the models range from the                       larger scale ageostrophic circulation around fronts to the                      microphysics of precipitation processes.  This is further                       complicated by the need to interface with large scale models and                to obtain boundary conditions.  The observational demands of                    such systems are substantial, and the compilation and analysis                  challenge is extraordinary.  The University of Oklahoma now has                 an NSF-funded Science and Technology Center, called \"Center for                 the Analysis and Prediction of Storms\" (CAPS.)  The kind of                     data assimilation work being advanced by Dr. Kapitza and the                    German center is now one of the principal foci of the CAPS                      program plan.",
