 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oxidation of water to molecular oxygen is a characteristic                  reaction associated with photosynthesis in higher plants and                    cyanobacteria.  Light quanta producing excitation of the                        photosystem results in the transfer of electrons one at a time                  until four electrons are removed from two water molecules to                    produce O2.  Drs. Sauer and Klein are investing the chemical                    intermediates involved in this transfer of electrons and in the                 storing of the oxidizing equivalents needed to yield O2.                        Manganese is involved in the water-splitting enzyme, and they                   are using X-ray absorption spectroscopy to determine the                        oxidation states, ligation and local structure around the Mn.                   Together with studies using EPR spectroscopy, their results                     have verified the direct participation of Mn oxidation state                    changes in the water-splitting process.  This proposal aims to                  characterize further the structure of the quartet of Mn atoms                   involved, the essential cofactors, inhibitors and protein                       ligands through the use of X-ray absorption spectroscopy,                       electron-nuclear and electron-electron double resonance                         spectroscopies.  They hope to learn, most importantly, how                      water becomes incorporated into the water-splitting enzyme                      prior to the final formation and release of O2.  Knowledge of                   this process will be most useful in development artificial                      systems whereby solar energy can be used to convert water into                  molecular oxygen and hydrogen fuel.",
