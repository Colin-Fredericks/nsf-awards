 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research             project in theoretical organic chemistry between Nenad Trinajstic of            the Rudjer Boskovic Institute and Douglas J. Klein of Texas A&M                 University at Galveston is to investigate the electronic structure              and properties of novel molecular systems by applying quantum                   chemical models.  The investigators will extend their conceptual                models in graph theory to elemental carbon clusters, high spin                  hydrocarbons, polymers and high temperature superconductors                     (inorganic perovskites).  The collaborative effort combines the                 complementary expertise of Dr. Trinajstic in chemical graph theory              and theoretical organic chemistry and Dr. Klein's expertise in                  quantum and computational chemistry.                                                                                                                            This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The award,                except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav             institution.  NSF's goal of advancing scientific knowledge is                   promoted through the joint efforts of the Yugoslav and U.S.                     scientists.",
