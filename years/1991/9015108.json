 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most studies of the Sun require observations over time.  Thus a                 variety of monitoring stations have been set around the world to                study solar phenomena on a variety of timescales.  An                           important source of solar observations in the U.S. is the 150-foot              \"solar tower\" telescope, located on Mount Wilson in California.                 This facility has been used on virtually every clear day for the                last 23 years to study large and medium scale velocity and magnetic             features on the surface of the Sun.  In addition, its sister 90-                foot tower is used daily to make sunspot drawings.  These drawings              are transmitted to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric                         Administration which make forecasts of solar flare events and                   assesses their impact on the Earth's magnetosphere.  The Principal              Investigator (PI) proposes to continue these observations over the              next three years.  During the new grant period a variety of large               solar projects or spacecraft will be launched, such as the Solar                Orbiting Helio-Observatory, the \"MAX 91\" solar-activity maximum                 campaign, and the Global Oscillation Network Group network, which               will utilize solar oscillations to infer the interior rotation and              density structure of the Sun.  The Mt. Wilson observations will                 directly support these enterprises every clear day by providing an              extensive, homogenous dataset of magnetic activity and gas flows                on the solar surface.",
