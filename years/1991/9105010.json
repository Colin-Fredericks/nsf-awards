 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of massive replacement dolomite remains one of the              major unresolved problems of sedimentology.  Presently favored                  interpretations for the origin of massive dolomites have centered               on \"early\" low temperature processes involving surface or near-                 surface waters, and alternative processes such as \"late\" burial                 dolomitization have been overlooked by all but a few workers.  The              recent development of theoretical and computer models of                        groundwater flow systems in sedimentary basins makes the time ripe              for a new look at burial dolomitization.  Fluid flow is the one new             factor of major significance that needs to be added to our attempts             to resolve the dolomite problem.  This is a study of the dolomite               of the Jurassic Vajont Oolite of the Venetian Alps in northern                  Italy where preliminary field and geochemical work indicates that               dolomitization occurred at elevated temperatures under burial                   conditions.  The approach will be to integrate fieldwork,                       petrography, isotope and fluid inclusion data, and hydrologic                   modeling.  The Vajont Oolite offers several special features that               make such a study worthwhile:  (1) it is massively but not                      completely dolomitized so that dolomitization fronts that give                  direct clues to the subsurface pathways of the dolomitizing fluids              can be mapped (see Newton, Hardie and Phillips, 1990); (2) it                   consists of shallow water ooids that were resedimented in deep                  water by slope processes before alteration, thus shallow water                  dolomitization processes are ruled out; (3) the ooids and their                 intergranular cements are well preserved in the undolomitized parts             of the Vajont sot hat it is possible to document in detail their                pre-dolomitization petrography and isotope geochemistry; thus, the              changes produced by dolomitization can be identified and measured;              (4) exposures of partly but massively dolomitized Vajont in                     roadcuts reveal that dolomitization fluid pathways were controlled              by fracture and fault planes of Late Tertiary age (Alpine orogeny),             indication unequivocally that the dolomitization was of \"late\"                  burial origin.                                                                       The results of the study could shed new light on the role of               deeply circulated subsurface fluids in the origin of massive                    dolomites, particularly those that act as reservoirs to oil, gas,               and hydrothermal ores.",
