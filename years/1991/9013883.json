 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the response of stream ecosystems                to nutrient limitation and the response of nutrient-limited stream              ecosystems to different types of environmental disturbances.                    Specific objectives are to (1) determine the role of in-place                   recycling of a limiting nutrient within the benthic boundary region             of natural stream reaches, (2) determine the spatial variation in               recycling both among streams and longitudinally within a stream,                and whether recycling varies in a predictable way, and (3) test                 some theoretical predictions about the relationship between                     ecosystem resilience/resistance and in-place nutrient recycling in              natural streams, including the effect of longitudinal                           nonuniformities in nutrient availability and recycling due to                   spatial heterogeneity in nutrient input and within-stream nutrient              uptake.  The overall goal is to better understand the factors                   regulating the structure and productivity of benthic communities                in lotic ecosystems, including their resistance and resistance to               disturbances that include scouring, toxicant pulses, and changes                in nutrient input.  The proposed work will be achieved by combining             theoretical analyses using mathematical models with empirical                   studies using both natural and laboratory streams that can be                   experimentally manipulated and to which releases of radiotracers                can be made to quantify nutrient cycling processes under ambient                conditions.  The network of large-scale laboratory streams and the              ability to use radiotracers in natural streams are unique                       capabilities for conducting stream ecosystem research at Oak Ridge              National Laboratory.",
