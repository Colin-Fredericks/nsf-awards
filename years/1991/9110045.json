 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arginine vasotocin and angiotensin II are antidiuretic                     hormones that influence water balance in many vertebrates.  Since               water is critical for survival, understanding how these hormones                enhance water-absorption is critical.  While most vertebrates                   have a regular and predictable water supply, desert animals live                in harsh conditions in which survival is dependent upon the                     ability to find, obtain and conserve water.  These species have                 evolved mechanisms of water retention which allows them to                      survive under these uncharitable conditions.  Dr. Propper has                   selected two species that differ in genetic background but live                 within the same austere environment.  She will employ a                         combination of behavioral, neuroanatomical and endocrine                        techniques to determine how these two neuropeptides influence                   water balance in two distinct desert species.  Dr. Propper will                 define the behavioral responses to arginine vasotocin and                       angiotensin 11, localize the neural binding of these                            neuropeptides; and then determine how environmental changes                     influence the brain and plasma concentrations.  By comparing the                hormonal effects species that differ in their genetic background,               she can determine whether similar neuroendocrine mechanisms are                 employed to manage water balance in vertebrates in general.",
