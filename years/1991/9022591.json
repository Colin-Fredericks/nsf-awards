 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to define the roles of separate                    components of the yeast transcriptional silencer at HMR E. Two                  components of the silencer at HMR E are binding sites for                       proteins that act else where as gene activators.  A third                       components exhibits properties of an origin of DNA replication.                 This research will address the issue of how these components                    combine to create a silencer by answering the following question.               Are gene activator function and DNA replication directly involved               in silencing, or are these properties of the parts of the                       silencer incidental to its function as a whole? The approach                    taken in this proposal is aimed at systematically identifying the               minimum constituents needed to generate a silencing effect on                   test minichromosomes defining the interactions of these                         constituents using primarily genetic techniques.  The experiments               described here will help characterize classes of protein and                    protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions generally employed                 to create compound regulatory elements.  Due to the nature of the               structure of the silencer the proposed experiments will not only                yield information on mechanisms of transcriptional repression and               hierarchies of chromosome organization, but will also open new                  avenues for addressing the function of gene activators and                      origins of DNA replication.  Investigations of these issues in                  yeast will have general applicability and will accelerate the                   analysis of these same problems in higher eukaryotes",
