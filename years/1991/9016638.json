 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on plasma processing                   of semi conductors as a collaborative research program                          between Santosh Srivastava of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, G.                     G. B. deSouza and A. C. de A. e Souza of the Federal University                 of Rio de Janeiro and I. Iga, of the Federal University of                      Sao Carlos (UFSCar), Brazil.  The three groups will generate                    complementary data on the electron impact collision cross                       section for molecules of interest in the low temperature                        plasma deposition an etching of semi-conducting materials.                      The technique of low density plasma deposition and etching is                   used in the field of micro-electronics.  Typically, gas                         pressures in these plasmas are such that number densities of                    molecules vary from 10.9 to 10.12 cm-3 and electron energies                    range from  1 ev to 10 3v.  They are highly non-thermal and                     mainly the electron collision processes determine their                         character.  Therefore, for modeling these plasmas an accurate                   knowledge of several different types of electron collision                      and photo-absorption cross section is important.                                                                                                                In order to characterize all important physical properties                      related to ion formation by electron impact on molecules of                     present interest one has to know all three aspects of ion                       formation discussed in the previous section i.e. i) absolute                    values of cross sections for the ion formation by electron                      impact ii) photoionization cross sections and ion-ion                           coincidences, and iii) kinetic energy spectrum of fragment                      ions.  At JPL the proposer has expertise and instrumentation                    for the measurement of absolute values of cross sections in                     the electron impact energy range from threshold to 1 KeV.  At                   UFRJ Drs. G. G. B. deSouza and A. C. de A. e Souza have                         established techniques and instrumentation for the study of                     the second aspect.  At UFSCar Drs. Ione Iga, Lee Mu Tao, and                    Jose Carlos Nogueira have instrumentation for the measurement                   of the kinetic energy of the fragment ions.  Thus, the work                     performed by the three groups will be complimentary.  A                         collaborative effort has already generated important data                       concerning molecules of present interest and will continue to                   do so in the future.",
