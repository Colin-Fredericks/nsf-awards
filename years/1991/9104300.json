Increasingly refined conodont biostratigraphic control has                      corrected several miscorrelations of stratigraphic units along                  outcrop, and has produced detailed correlations with the cyclic                 sequences in Texas and Illinois.  NSF funds will support one of 3               interactive projects within this research program: detailed study               of a biostratigraphically constrained coeval paleosol interval from             Texas and Nebraska to the Appalachians, to determine both the                   geographic patterns of climate during a sea-level low-stand and the             succession of climate changes related to minor sea-level                        fluctuations during this time of low stand.  This work is designed              to lead to delineation of the geographic and temporal patterns of               climate change during lower stands of sea level.",
