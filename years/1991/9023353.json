 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is part of an ongoing project on the economics of                    airline hub-and-spoke networks. To date, work has focused on how                airline fares in an individual city-pair market are related to the              characteristics of the hub-and-spoke network serving the market.                Empirical findings suggest that, by allowing airlines to exploit                economies of traffic density, networks reduce airlines costs and                thereby lower the fares charged to passengers.                                                                                                                  Several extensions of this work are pursued in this project. A                  version of the model will be estimated where spoke traffic levels               replace network characteristics in the regression equation. With                economies of density, high traffic levels on the spokes connecting              the cities in a given market should lead to low fares. Spoke                    traffic levels, however, must be treated as endogenous, being                   determined in part by network characteristics, Second, a structural             model of network traffic determination will be estimated that                   allows the parameters of the airlines cost function to be                       identified. The estimates should indicate the actual magnitude of               economies of traffic density. Finally, the impact of the TWA-Ozark              and Northwest-Republic mergers on the fares paid by connecting                  passengers at the St. Louis and Minneapolis hubs will be estimated.             Simulations based on previous empirical estimates suggest that                  these fares should have fallen in response to the mergers.",
