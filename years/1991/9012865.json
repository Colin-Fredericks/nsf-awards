 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Bernstein is analyzing major issues involving scientists              (mostly physicists) and nuclear-weapons policy.  These issues                   include radiological weapons, 1941-54; the development of tactical              nuclear weapons, 1943-54; and the quest for the H-bomb, 1942-54,                including the establishment of Livermore Lab and the 1952 and 1954              efforts to secure a test-ban.  In this study, Professor Bernstein               is examining the roles of leading scientists in weapons and defense             policy:  their thinking about the development, deployment, and use              of weapons; their efforts to slow, redirect, or propel the buildup              of the nuclear arsenal; their actual influence on weapons policy;               their relationship to the military and AEC funding; and these                   scientists' beliefs about the ethical responsibilities of                       scientists.  This research is partly an effort to understand the                rise of the defense scientists by studying their activities, in                 depth, in the development of these weapons.                                                                                                                     This research has grown out of Professor Bernstein's earlier work               on World War II and postwar policy.  The study is based heavily on              archival research in over 45 collections, and also on use of oral               histories and on interviews or correspondence with over 20                      scientists.",
