 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to establish a Scanning                                         Tunnel/Atomic Force Microscopy (STM/AFM)                                        program at Appalachian State University.  This                                  program will be used as a teaching tool for                                     undergraduates and will provide research                                        opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate                               students in Applied Physics.                                                    The research projects will focus on the surface                                 characterization of materials provided by Dr. Phil                              Russell as a collaborative effort between ASU and                               the Precision Engineering Center at North Carolina                              State University.  The STM will be used to study                                three specific areas:  surface roughness of metal                               overlayers, optical component quality, and                                      nanometer metallization.                                                        The STM is a surface analysis tool which is limited                             to the study of conducting samples.  The surface                                roughness of thin metal overlayers on insulators will                           be examined in an attempt to find materials which:                              form a uniform overlayer; can be studied with the                               STM; and preserve the insulator surface                                         topography. Surface roughness studies can also be                               used to provide insight into the processing of high                             quality optical insight into the processing of high                             quality optical components, which often requires                                surface features to be less than a few atomic units.                            Lastly, nanometer metallization of silicon will be                              explored by using a low energy (-10eV) beam from                                the STM to dissociate PD from Pd-Ac thin films.",
