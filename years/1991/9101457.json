 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with development and evaluation              of algorithms for signal processing and analysis that exploit                   higher order statistics of signals in addition to, or in lieu of,               the usual second order statistics.  Whereas the second order                    statistics of signals are a function of only the underlying system              transfer function magnitude, higher order statistics depend upon                both the system transfer function magnitude as well as its phase.               Both time series (only system output is observed) and system                    identification (both input and output are observed) formulations                are being considered.  Several aspects of the problem including                 inverse and direct modeling, deconvolution and parameter                        estimation, are being investigated.  Emphasis in this project is                on optimization of an appropriately defined fourth cumulant                     criterion in conjunction with, or in lieu of, the usual second                  order error criterion, thereby obviating the need for explicit data             cumulant matching.  Among the applications being investigated are               1) time delay estimation in unknown spatially uncorrelated Gaussian             noise, 2) blind deconvolution with unknown, possibly nonminimum                 phase, channels, and 3) system identification with noisy inputs.",
