 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr Eckman and collaborators will develop some general,                     quantitative models designed to assess the relative roles of                    transport, turbulent mixing and shear, larval development and                   larval behavior in producing spatial and temporal variability in                rates of settlement of planktonic larvae of benthic                             invertebrates.  The focus will be largely, but not exclusively,                 on unique problems faced by planktonic larvae of benthic                        existence.  These investigators will begin by creating simple,                  steady, 1-dimensional models that should enable us to evaluate                  selected larval flux conditions at the boundary, and to assess                  the relative influence of many important scaling variables on                   settlement rate.  Variables studied in 1-D models will include                  the scale and density of bottom roughness features, boundary                    shear velocity (including lift and drag forces exerted on                       larvae), turbulent mixing, larval swimming, substrate                           selectivity by larvae, and the degree of larval competence to                   settle.  The development and evaluation of these models will                    include laboratory studies of larval behavior and settlement to                 ensure accuracy.  The models will indicate which scaling                        variables must be incorporated, and which can reasonably be                     deleted, from more complex models that more closely mimic field                 situations.  Dr. Eckman et al. will build and evaluate a series                 of more complex, ideal models, which have broader ecological                    relevance.  These models will include time-dependent flows that                 account for wind-wave or tidal forcing, and 2-dimensional, steady               flows that incorporate horizontal gradients in bottom roughness                 or depth.  Thus, the research will incorporate physical dynamics,               biological development and behavior into quantitative formulae.                 This work will generate predictions of variability in rates of                  larval settlement in space and time for several ecologically                    relevant situations.  For each case, the models will indicate the               relative sensitivity of larval settlement rates to a suite of                   potentially important hydrodynamic and biological process.  The                 research proposed includes conceptual studies of simplification                 and predictability, and prototype investigations of biological                  processes in idealized flow fields - two categories of research                 targeted for support under GLOBEC's modelling program.",
