 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will address the regulation of cell form and the                  segregation of surface domains in a model unicellular system,                   Euglena.  In Euglena, cell form is maintained by a peripheral                   membrane skeleton that is bound to the plasma membrane by an                    integral membrane protein, IP39.  The interactions between IP39                 and the two major membrane skeletal proteins (articulins) will be               dissected by isolating the binding region, evaluating the                       significance of phosphorylation of that site, and determining its               amino acid sequence with a combination of partial peptide                       sequencing and deduction of amino acid sequences from cDNA clones.              The 80 and 86 kD membrane skeletal proteins (articulins) will be                radiolabeled and fragmented to identify their binding domains to                each other and to IP39.  Partial peptide sequencing will be                     correlated with the deduced amino acid sequences now available from             the cDNA clones of both proteins.  A genomic library will be                    constructed and the cDNAs will be used to identify clones with 80               and 86 kD encoding regions.  Regions 5' (upstream) to the cDNAs                 will be of particular interest as they may contain sequences                    specific for regulating the synthesis of proteins of the cell                   surface.  A 205 kD protein associated with the membrane skeleton                will be further assessed, as it has immunoidentity and a size                   similar to the vertebrate membrane skeletal proteins.  C-DNA clones             for the 205 kD proteins will be selected and sequenced for                      comparative studies.  Targeting signals for flagellar specific                  components (mastigonemes and the paraxial rod) will be sought from              analysis of amino termini obtained from sequence analysis of cDNA               clones for paraxial rods and mastigoneme proteins.  Regions upsteam             to the cDNAs will be sequenced using clones from the proposed                   genomic library in order to identify regulatory signals specific                to flagella-localized proteins as distinguished from the cell                   surface restricted articulins and IP39.                                                                                                                         The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular              and biochemical bases for generating and maintaining cell form and              for targeting proteins to areas critical to generating cell form.",
