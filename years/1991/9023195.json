 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on elliptic variational problems,                     parabolic variational inequalities, equimeasurable convex                       symmetrization, variational integrals involving mappings of bounded             variation, and nonlinear potential theory.  Much of the proposer's              recent work in the area of elliptic variational problems has                    concentrated on problems involving the regularity of solutions to               variational inequalities that arise from both irregular and smooth              obstacles and that involve degenerate elliptic operators.  An                   approach has been developed that may yield more information about               the free boundary in the case of smooth obstacles and it may lead               also to another treatment in the case of elliptic systems.  These               questions and techniques lead to their parabolic counterparts in                parabolic variational inequalities where less is known and the                  difficulties are greater.  Many of the questions and techniques in              elliptic variational problems, and parabolic variational                        inequalities have considerable overlap with those in nonlinear                  potential theory.  The proposer finds the problems of                           equimeasurable convex symmetrization and variational integrals                  involving mappings of bounded variation especially compelling                   because of their interaction with geometric analysis and the                    promise of going further in the direction of applied areas.",
