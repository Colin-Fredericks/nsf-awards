 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year collaborative project between                Professor Martin H. Spalding, Department of Botany, Iowa State                  University, and Dr. Murray R. Badger, Australian National University,           Canberra, under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program.  The            scientists will study aspects of the photosynthetic process in the              unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  This and other                     unicellular algae are very efficient in their use of external                   inorganic carbon for photosynthesis, and exhibit additional                     interesting photosynthetic characteristics as well.  The cooperating            researchers believe these effects are the result of intracellular               carbon dioxide concentration levels in the algae which are                      significantly greater than in most higher plants.  A \"carbon                    dioxide-concentrating mechanism\" has been proposed by the                       investigators which involves energy-requiring transport of inorganic            carbon (as carbon dioxide or bicarbonate ion) into and within the               algal cells, followed by enzyme-catalyzed conversion of accumulated             bicarbonate ion to yield enhanced levels of carbon dioxide.  It is              the aim of this cooperative project to understand better the                    transport mechanism and to determine the location of the enzyme                 (carbonic anhydrase) within the cell.                                                                                                                           Both the U.S. and Australian groups have been active in this area of            research, using complementary approaches and techniques.  Professor             Spalding and his colleagues have emphasized molecular genetic                   studies of the CO2-concentrating mechanism in microalgae, while Dr.             Badger and his group in Australia have focused their related efforts            on cyanobacteria, and have developed special mass spectrometric and             centrifugation techniques to aid in the analyses.  The cooperative              project will build upon the strengths of both groups, and will                  involve exchanges by the principal investigators as well as by                  their postdoctoral associates.",
