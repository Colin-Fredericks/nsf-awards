 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Voytek, together with Canadian and Yugoslovian                         collaborators, will conduct exploratory excavations at four early               Neolithic archaeological sites located the Dalmatia region of                   Yugoslovia. These sites, which were discovered in a previous                    survey of the region, are known by surface indications to contain               cultural material from this period but more detailed information                is necessary before a comprehensive research plan can be devised.               For this purpose small scale excavation is necessary. The testing               of the four sites will focus on basic but important questions:                  When were the sites occupied?  Under what cultural and later                    geological conditions did they form?  How well are materials -                  especially delicate floral and faunal remains - preserved?  What                is the range of economic data recoverable?  Does further                        investigation seem warranted?  Approximately one week will be                   spent conducting test excavations at each site and recovered                    materials materials will be analyzed.  Based on the results,                    funding will be sought for a longer term large-scale excavation                 of one of the sites.  The goal will be to explore in greater                    detail the questions surrounding the early history of agriculture               in this region.                                                                                                                                                      While archaeologists know that plants and animals were first               domesticated in the Near East about 10,000 years ago and then                   spread though Europe, the details of this process are still                     unknown.  Some believe that this expansion took place through the               direct movement of people who, moving from east to west, brought                the domesticated sheep, goat, cow, as well as grain crops with                  them.  According to this scenario, local hunters and gatherers                  were either displaced or absorbed by the newcomers.  Others,                    however, argue that it was the traits themselves rather than                    peoples which moved; local hunters and gatherers thus obtained                  new items from others and then adapted and integrated them into                 their own cultures.  Unfortunately, the data are not available                  which would allow selection between these alternatives.  Because                very little work has been done in the Dalmatian region and                      because it lies near the point of origin, the information                       provided by Dr. Voytek and her colleagues will help to answer                   this question.                                                                                                                                                       This project is important for several reasons.  First, it                  will increase our understanding of how important culture traits                 are transmitted and how cultures change.  Second, it will provide               new data on a poorly known region.  Finally, it will hopefully                  set the stage for a larger subsequent project.",
