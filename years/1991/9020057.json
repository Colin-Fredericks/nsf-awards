 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many traits of primary interest in plant and animal                        improvement programs and in conservation biology are affected by                a large number of genes with relatively small individual effects.               This often means that relatively large germ plasm banks must be                 maintained at considerable cost to insure that all potentially                  useful alleles are maintained in a population or species.                       Theoretical work of W.G. Hill at the University of Edinburgh                    raises the question of whether this is a necessary practice or                  whether, alternatively, new mutations can be counted on to supply               genetic variation needed for future change.                                          This project is designed to focus on two aspects of the Hill               work using a laboratory organism (the flour beetle) to test the                 ideas.  Selection for a quantitative trait (body size) will be                  used to determine the amount of useful variation that is                        generated by new mutation.  Much of the existing dogma suggest                  that most mutational variation is likely to be deleterious                      rather than helpful.  The second aspect of the work will evaluate               how important it is to apply constant selection pressure to                     utilize any new mutational variation that might otherwise be                    immediately lost since the new mutations will be at a low                       frequency in the population.  The importance of population size                 in capitalizing on the effects of new mutations will also receive               considerable attention.",
