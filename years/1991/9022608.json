 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a monocular observer moves in a 3D world, the parts which can                be seen and their geometry change with the observer's vantage                   point.  This project undertakes to quantitatively describe and                  model the relationships between motion and the induced change in                the appearance of 3D shape.  Because motion is such an integral                 part of this information gathering and processing process, the                  investigators are developing a uniform spatiotemporal approach to               3D object representation and intermediate-level motion                          description for dynamic model-based 3D object recognition.  To                  model explicitly the dynamic appearance of objects as the                       viewpoint moves, the approach uses \"aspect space\" which is the                  cross product of the image plane and viewpoint space.  New 3D                   object representations are being developed in this                              multidimensional space, including the asp and the rim appearance                representation.  These representations describe how visible,                    geometric features of projected shape can change over time due to               egomotion or object motion.  Complementing this work on dynamic                 viewer-centered representations, the research will also derive                  intermediate-level motion descriptions from the motion of                       features in spatiotemporal image volumes prior to object                        recognition and description.  Methods will be developed for                     intermediate-level motion description including spatiotemporal                  surface flow and flow line detection, segmentation of                           spatiotemporal surfaces, and the detection of properties such as                cyclic motion and T-junction motion.",
