 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economies of scale achieved through mass production of a limited                number of products has been the cornerstone of successful                       manufacturing throughout this century.  For most industries, this               strategy is rapidly becoming obsolete as the competitive emphasis               shifts to producing an enormous variety of products at costs                    approaching the efficiency of mass production.  This trend to                   variety competition is driven by many factors.  This proposal                   describes a program of research to develop models and algorithms                for designing the products in a product line and for designing and              managing the production process in an environment of high product               variety.  The first component of our research is concerned with                 developing detailed sequencing models and algorithms appropriate                for managing the mixed-model transfer lines that will soon become               the dominant production process for automobiles.  The second                    component is developing strategic planning models and algorithms                that integrate product planning, technology choice and design of                production lines.",
