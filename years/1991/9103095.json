 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in separation science are critical to future U.S.                 economic competitiveness in the industries and the I/UCRC Program.              The objectives of the Center for Separations Using Thin Films at                the University of Colorado, Boulder are to:  (a) conduct basic                  research and related development activities for the use of thin                 film technology in separation processes and b) provide rapid                    technology transfer between Center research projects and industrial             participants.  Thin films such as ceramics and polymers offer new               separation possibilities with a resulting impact on the capital,                operating costs, and energy consumption in industries that can use              the technology such as the chemical, petro chemical and gas                     separation industries.                                                               The proposed center plans to work on acid/gas separation using             ion-exchange membranes and separation of olefin isomers using novel             transport membranes.  It will also focus on membrane fouling in                 liquid phase cross-filtration, modeling, and laboratory studies for             control of solvent-cast membrane morphology in gas separation                   applications, etc.                                                                   This Center is being cost-shared with the Separations and                  Purification Program of the Division of Chemical and Thermal                    Systems (E.I. Frances, Program Director).                                            The Program Director recommends that the University of                     Colorado, Boulder be awarded $60,000 per year for a five year                   continuing grant.                                                                    Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                   and/or the Director of the Engineering Center Division will review              the progress of the center on a number of criteria, including the               following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                     interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) The extent to                  which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                  robust research program is developing.  If the review is                        satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support of the                next period of this continuing grant.",
