 "awd_abstract_narration": "Life history characters such as fecundity and age at first                      reproduction, are closely related to the ultimate survival and                  reproductive ability of plants.  Life history traits are directly               affected by artificial and natural selection and are therefore of               particular concern for both plants breeders and evolutionary                    biologists alike.  The expression of these traits is thought to                 be the result of many genes of small effect (quantitative trait                 loci or QTLs).  Predictions about the rate and direction of                     evolutionary change depend on the number of segregating QTLs and                the magnitude of their effects.  The actual number of QTLs                      involved in quantitative variation, and the importance and                      prevalence of QTLs of large effect is still virtually unknown.                                                                                                  Methods based on statistical theory have been used to estimate                  the minimum number of QTLs influencing a trait, and the relative                magnitude of their effects, but these methods lack precision.  In               contrast, techniques of molecular biology and classical                         quantitative genetics provide a powerful means of estimating the                minimum number of QTLs and their relative effects.                                                                                                              This study will use genetic markers in Arabidopsis thaliana to                  answer the following questions: 1) How many QTLs control the                    timing of flowering? 2) Are there genes of large effect?  3) Do                 interactions between flowering time and other characters                        important to plant survival prevent genes of large effect from                  being important in the evolution of flowering time?  Arabidopsis                is the ideal organism for this study because the existing map is                extraordinarily complete.  The existence of naturally occurring                 inbred lines greatly simplifies statistical analyses.  These                    techniques have been used with success in marker-aided selection                programs for economically important traits in a few crop plants.                They are powerful tools in genetic improvement programs, as well                as for addressing fundamental evolutionary and genetic questions.               However, these techniques have not been applied to natural plant                populations.  This work will provide some of the first data on                  the number of genes and the magnitude of genetic effects within                 species.",
