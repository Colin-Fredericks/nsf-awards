 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support joint research between US and                           French researchers on the topic of multinational econometric                    policy analysis.  The US investigators are:  Dr. Robert F.                      Engle, Dr. Clive W. Granger, and Dr. Halbert L. White,                          University of California at San Diego. The collaborators                        in France are:  Dr. Michel Lubrano, Dr. Luc Bauwens and Dr.                     Russell Davidson, University of Aix-Marseille II and III.                       The objective of the project is to develop and apply                            statistical techniques to evaluate policy models.                                                                                                               Potentially one of the most important activities by                             econometricians and applied economists is the production of                     models to be used by policy makers to help them determine                       an appropriate policy.  However, these models have to pass                      not only standard specification tests and evaluation                            procedures, but they also have to show that they are                            relevant for policy purposes.  Testing procedures for these                     models are very preliminary and are in need of both further                     theoretical and empirical development.  In this project,                        the investigators will examine and apply econometric                            methods to study existing models.  Theoretical developments                     will be coupled with empirical studies, which examine the                       co-movements of output and asset prices across countries.                       Both the US and French groups have extensive experience in                      both the theory and practice of econometrics, as well as in                     the development and application of tests and testing                            procedures.  In particular, the French investigators bring                      to the project experience of testing procedures based on                        methods associated with the use of artificial regressions,                      as well as Bayesian specification testing.",
