 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phototransduction is the process whereby light energy is                        converted into an electrical signal in the photoreceptor                        membrane.  The goal of this research project is to gain insight                 into the mechanisms that underlie phototransduction in the                      photoreceptor cells of the eye.  Photoreceptor cells, isolated                  from the eye of the fruitfly, Drosophila, will be used as a model               system, since the phototransduction process in the fly retina is                similar to that in the vertebrate retina, including those of                    mammals.  When light strikes the eye, a cascade of biochemical                  events occur within the photoreceptor cells.  At the endpoint of                the cascade, an unknown intracellular messenger molecule causes                 \"light-sensitive\" ion channels in the photoreceptor membrane to                 open.  The opening of the ion channels causes the cell membrane                 to undergo a change in its electrical potential which is                        responsible for the transmission of visual information to the                   brain.  The study will focus on the role of ion channels in the                 phototransduction process and identify the intracellular                        messenger molecule which activates and modulates the activity of                light sensitive channels.  Experiments utilizing the                            electrophysiological technique of patching clamping will be used                to examine the role of ion channels in this process.  This                      technique will permit the Principal investigator to examine the                 function of all channels in the membrane acting in unison or                    examine single channels isolated in small membrane patches.                     Results gained from these studies will aid in understanding the                 function and regulation of ion channels involved in the visual                  system.",
