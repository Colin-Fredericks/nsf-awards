 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two objectives characterize the design of new                              telecommunications networks.  One is to support high bandwidth                  applications (such as digitized video and image communication) made             possible by the high capacity of fiber optics transmission systems;             the second is to provide a single communications system which                   supports all services in an integrated and unified fashion.  In                 response to these objectives, packet switching is emerging as the               appropriate switching technique.                                                     Several proposed architectural designs for fast packet                     switches have emerged in recent years.  There is a need to evaluate             and compare these proposals under various traffic scenarios with                respect to the performance of the switch as seen by network users.              The performance measures, which are typically expressed in terms of             packet loss and packet delay, must be tailored to be consistent                 with the specific requirement of the applications supported.  This              research will create a unified framework consisting of a precise                definition of the performance measures of interest and a                        characterization of the basic traffic patterns corresponding to the             various applications and their mixes to be supported by a fast                  packet switch.  Using this framework the research will examine the              performance of switches in two steps by 1) focusing on single                   module switches of the above mentioned types and 2) addressing the              case of large switches composed of several switching modules                    organized in multistage configurations.  Both mathematical analysis             and computer simulation will be used in this study.",
