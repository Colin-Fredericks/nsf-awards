 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Perrin will                 utilize nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to                        investigate five separate problems: (i) The stereochemistry of                  amidinate anions will be studied to complete previous                           investigations of proton exchange in amides and amidines. (ii)                  Stereoelectronic control phenomena will be studied by                           evaluating the effect on reactivity of having one or two lone                   electron pairs antiperiplanar to a leaving group or incoming                    nucleophile. (iii) The Method of Isotopic Perturbation of                       Equilibrium will be utilized as a means to investigate the                      symmetry of the hydrogen bond. (iv) The extent of solvation of                  ions in aqueous media will be probed by measuring the effect                    that these ions have upon bond rotation rates. (v) The                          phenomenon of large secondary kinetic isotope effects will be                   studied via examination of bond rotations in amides.                            %%%                                                                             Applications of modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                         techniques have led to increased understanding of molecular                     structure and reactivity. Dr. Perrin's research program is                      designed to take advantage of these new techniques in order to                  study two of the simplest structural elements in organic                        molecules, i.e., protons and electron pairs. Five projects will                 be undertaken in an effort to elucidate the nature of such                      fundamental phenomena as hydrogen bonding and                                   stuructural/conformational effects on reactivity. The results                   are likely to be of interest to physical-organic chemists,                      biochemists, and theoretical chemists.",
