 "awd_abstract_narration": "A local area network of graphic-oriented microcomputers, a                      database server machine, document scanning and printing                         devices, and software is being configured as a laboratory model                 of a small office system together with capabilities for                         software development.  The laboratory supports instruction of                   computer science in three areas: (i) office system development:                 hands-on experience using and developing systems for a \"real\"                   office environment; (ii) software engineering: use of graphic                   CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools including                      prototyping tools; and (iii) human-machine interaction:                         development of software using visual forms and direct-                          manipulation, input and processing of forms, pictures, and                      voice data, and use and development of systems for                              collaborative work.  The laboratory supports junior and senior                  level laboratory-oriented courses in the three subject areas                    for majors in computing and information sciences, and                           electrical and computer engineering.  Students in the office                    automation laboratory serve as \"users\" of software for the                      software development laboratories.  Office software includes                    desktop publishing, electronic messaging, and a shared                          information system for personnel and accounting data.  This                     laboratory provides undergraduate computing science experience                  from program development to information systems development.",
