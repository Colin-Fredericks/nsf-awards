 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this research is to understand the                        mechanisms by which ordered assemblies of biological                            macromolecules are formed.  These symmetrical structures are                    made up of molecules having specific, repeated interactions                     with each other.  They include both extended structures, such                   as cytoskeletal filaments and membrane photoreceptor arrays,                    and compact ones, such as nuclear pore complexes and viruses.                   They play crucial roles in cell morphology, motility, and other                 areas of cell function.  The question to be investigated is:                    how do such ordered structures assemble themselves, i.e. how                    do the component molecules find their way to, recognize, and                    attach to specific sites?                                                                                                                                       The more immediate aim is to apply the emerging technique of                    atomic force microscopy to a model self-assembling system, a                    three-dimensional protein crystal.  Besides constituting a                      simple case of ordered assembly crystallization is generally                    the rate-limiting step in determining protein structure by                      X-ray diffraction.  To develop rational guidelines for                          optimizing crystal growth, Dr. Durbin proposes to study the                     fundamental process of crystallization.  Protein crystals have                  unique advantages for developing and applying methods of atomic                 force microscopy to imaging biological molecules and                            structures.",
