 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical stage in the advanced evolution of stars like the Sun                occurs as they rapidly shed the mass of their envelopes to become               dying white dwarf stars.   Radiation from the hot white dwarf                   remnant star excites the ejected material as it slowly leaves the               vicinity.  The result is an object called a \"planetary nebula\",                 which is visible only in certain specific wavelengths.  The                     Principal Investigator will continue previous work in analyzing the             strengths of spectral \"emission lines\" to determine the chemical                abundances of the material in eight planetary nebulae in order to               understand the sequence of nuclear reactions that occurred in the               interior of their central stars prior to their creation by                      ejection.   The PI will make use of a modern solid-state array                  detector (CCD) with a new echelle spectrograph on the three-meter               telescope at Lick Observatory to enable him to measure many lines               too weak to be measured in previous studies.  Also, the PI will                 utilize up-to-date model atmosphere computations to permit him to               synthesize the abundance results from all these data into a self-               consistent picture of the element abundances.  This study will                  provide new information on the effects of density variations,                   geometry, and chemical abundance variations within the observed                 nebulae.",
