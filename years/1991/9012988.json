 "awd_abstract_narration": "The doctoral dissertation student, Ms. Nancy Robin Jaicks, is                   examining a case of local resistance to national science and                    medical policy in light of new scientific and medical practices.                                                                                                A truism of American political theory is that \"all politics is                  local.\"  A corollary to that truism may well be, if all politics                                                                                                is local, localities will differ greatly in acceptance or                       rejection of national policies which differ from local needs.                   When national politics too greatly differ from factors affecting                                                                                                citizens, the policy fails.  In the US, such was the case with                  national prohibition of consumption and sale of alcoholic                       beverages.  The \"law of the land\" prohibited alcoholic                          consumption and sale, yet this policy was widely ignored.  Ms.                  Jaicks is studying the relationship of national policy and local                                                                                                resistance in the context of its relationship to science and                    medical practice.  Specifically she is examining the case of                    science and medical practice in Lyon in 19th century France.                    What she finds, however, has enormous implications for our                      understanding of the factors that make for failed public policy                 in our times as well.                                                                                                                                           The 19th century was a period of major developments within                      science and medicine.  Embryology and reproductive physiology                   were making enormous advances.  The germ theory of disease was                  being developed, theories of antisepsis and discoveries of                      effective anesthesia made surgeries much safer.  For social,                    political and professional reasons, however, a very politicized                 physician class had pushed through extremely restrictive                        requirements for medical procedures.  These restrictions ignored                                                                                                the new scientific developments.  What Ms. Jaicks has found is                  that, despite a national policy, local communities such a Lyon,                 confronting there own set of local conditions, turned to the new                                                                                                developments in antisepsis, anesthesia and biological sciences                  and ignored the national policies.  Ms. Jaicks dissertation will                                                                                                examine how the federal policies were developed and how the local                                                                                               factors led to the failure of this federal public policy.",
