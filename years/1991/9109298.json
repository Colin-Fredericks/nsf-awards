 "awd_abstract_narration": "Direct implementation of the sensory-cognitive motor triad for                  intelligent robotic systems will generally place severe demands                 on the computing, communication, and memory resources of these                  systems.  One solution to this problem has been to distribute the               triad's functionality among various physical components of the                  robot.  The colony-style robot \u01311! and its predecessor \u01312!                      (subsummation architecture) represent related methods for                       achieving this functional distribution.  Colony-style robots use                a collection(ie., colony) of hierarchically inhibited agents to                 control the robot.  Existing colony-style robots suffer several                 disadvantages limiting their utility as autonomous system.  These               disadvantages involve problems in determining the robot's                       underlying control hierarchy and the inability of  existing                     systems to save and use prior experience.  This project uses                    multiagent processing paradigms called multiagent search                        strategies of MASS algorithms \u01313! to solve the deficiencies of                  current colony-style systems.  MASS algorithms ar inspired by                   recent work with competitively and cooperatively inhibited neural               networks \u01313!\u01314!.  It can be shown, using statistical mechanical                 arguments, that competitive MASS algorithms can form minimum                    entropy representations of density functions.  This project uses                that analytical formalism to develop MASS algorithms capable of                 learning the components and structure of the colony-style control               hierarchy.  The research also explores how \"cooperative\"  MASS                  can be used to realize fully discretized solution of Bellman's                  dynamic programming equation, and uses this capability to devise                a method for implementing long term memory and path planning                    capabilities in colony-style robots.  The project will fully                    develop, through simulation and analysis, the MASS algorithms                   needed to realize memory, learning, and planning in colony-style                robots.  The research will also investigate extensions of this                  approach to more complex systems such as flexible manufacturing                 systems.",
