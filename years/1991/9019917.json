 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organisms can become resistant to new diseases or utilize a                new food source as a result of diversity in their genetic                       material which serves as raw material for the evolutionary                      process.  Many mechanisms exist to increase or decrease the                     amounts of genetic diversity.  Inbreeding, a mating system where                closely related individuals mate to produce offspring, can reduce               genetic variation in natural populations by increasing the                      probability that genes are identical by descent.  In plants,                    inbreeding can lead to short-lived plants and reduced crop yields               when the identical genes are lethal genes.  As a  result, some                  plants have evolved a self-incompatibility mechanism that                       prevents self-fertilization and the harmful effects of                          inbreeding.                                                                          In many species of plants, the self-incompatibility function               is encoded by a single gene.  The self-incompatibility gene can                 not only increase genetic variation at the locus that encodes it                but may also increase diversity of genes located nearby.  The                   main objective of this research is to study variation of                        nucleotide sequences of the self-incompatibility locus of Solanum               carolinense, the horse nettle, in order to determine the impact                 that the self-incompatibility mechanism has on this unique                      genetic locus and on nearby nucleotide sites.",
