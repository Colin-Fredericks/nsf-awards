 "awd_abstract_narration": "The idea that ecological processes such as competition and                 predication influence assemblages of species has been a common                  theme ever since the scientific method was applied to ecological                systems.  Such factors have been posited as explanations for many               of the patterns seen in nature.  The P.I. will investigate                      competitive hierarchies (species A always beats species B and C,                and B always beats C) can be altered to such that an extent that                an intransitive relationship (i.e.,) species A beats species B,                 which beats species C, which beats species A) using several                     invasion sequences which resulted in a change in ordering of the                intransitivity.  The P.I. propose a series of experiments                       designed to explore competition for resources based on                          physiological, population, and community level factors.  The                    experimentation and theoretical analysis of this phenomenon                     promises to uncover ecological mechanics which may very well                    recast some of the current views of interspecific competition.",
