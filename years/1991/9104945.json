 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coal exploration models have vacillated from one spectrum                  extreme to another during the past 30 years.  When the Mississippi              delta was believed to be the stereotypical depositional regime for              thick peat accumulations (coal analogues), all attention was                    focused on the identification and delimitation of deltaic                       lithofacies.  When it was demonstrated that conditions in the                   Mississippi delta were not precursors to thick peat accumulation,               coastal models were generated in which thick peats were restricted              to coastal plain sites adjacent to one or more deltas.  No longer               were deltas the exploration target.  In modern peat accumulating                regimes of southeast Asia both extremes do occur but intermediate               conditions also prevail.  Previously, the PI has identified five                phytotaphonomic facies in the clastic-dominated, tide-influenced                Mahakam River delta of eastern Kalimantan, Indonesia.  In this                  system the only peat that has been encountered is detrital in                   origin, accumulating along the delta front.  The present project                is designed to test whether or not the same macrofloral biofacies               are characteristic of a contemporaneous delta, the Rajang River                 delta, Sarawak (on the opposite side of the island of Borneo), in               which ombrogenous peat swamps have formed.  The project is designed             to recover vibracores in the same clastic sedimentary environments              as was previously sampled in the Mahakam River delta in order to                determine if deltaic biofacies are applicable throughout the                    gradient of deltaic types occurring in the same climatic regime.                In addition, the project offers the opportunity to assess                       palynofacies and determine whether or not proportions of                        palynodebris actually can be used to differentiate sedimentary                  environments, or if the systematic affinities of pollen and spores              are necessary data to apply palynofacies characteristics as an aid              in environmental interpretation.  Additionally, macrofloral                     biofacies will be used to test whether the predisposition for                   autochthonous peat accumulation is based more on the vegetational               community succession (as reflected in differences in prevailing                 edaphic conditions) than on other physical parameters.",
