 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central feature of contracts is that they are necessarily                     incomplete.  It is a fact of life that contracts between parties                often require renegotiation and even legal intervention for                     definition, clarification, execution, and enforcement.  Yet, there              has been limited attention in the literature to either the process              of renegotiation or the effects of legal frameworks on contracting              and the anticipation of contracting opportunities.                                                                                                              Through formal modelling, Drs. Hermalin and Katz seek to assess the             relative efficiency of renegotiation and judicial interpretation                as ways of handling the incompleteness of contracts.  The work                  addresses three classes of contracts--sales contracts, debt or                  bankruptcy contracts, and a \"best effort\" service or franchise                  contract.  For each area, these investigators will examine (1) the              basic assumptions about the information structure of the parties                (including the judge), (2) the nature of the contracts that private             parties would reach in a given legal environment, and (3) the                   outcomes of handling incompleteness under alternative legal                     regimes.                                                                                                                                                        This research should produce results that will further our basic                understanding of contracting and the role of courts in contract                 enforcement.  As important, the project ties the developing                     economics literature on contracting closer to the empirical                     realities of law by focusing on the role of the contract                        enforcement and damage rules administered by the courts.  Also, the             work adds new sophistication to the law and economics literature                on contract damages by closely scrutinizing the information                     available to the parties and the conditions before them for                     renegotiation.  Finally, this effort--in particular, the emphasis               on renegotiation--could very well change our view of why contracts              are incomplete and what the courts can and should do to deal with               this incompleteness.",
