 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent experimental studies have shown that many                                extraordinary magnetic properties can be achieved                               in multilayer nanostructure polycrystalline thin                                films, e.g. high coercivities.  In this proposal, a                             computer modeling study is proposed to simulate                                 the microscopic magnetization processes and                                     structures in the multilayer nanostructure film.  The                           main objective of the study is to understand the                                mechanisms for those extraordinary magnetic                                     properties and to be able to suggest new film                                   nanostructures for developing more advanced                                     magnetic thin films.  Important physical quantities                             and intrinsic material properties, such as crystalline                          structure and interfacial properties are included in                            the model.  Ferromagnetic exchange and                                          magnetostatic interactions are included.                                        Microscopic magnetization configurations and their                              dynamic behavior are obtained by solving coupled                                Landau-Lifshitz equations.  In this study, small size                           magnetization structures are to be discovered and                               behavior of these structures which determines the                               film magnetic properties will be characterized.                                 Correlations between film magnetic properties and                               film nanostructures, intrinsic material properties,                             and interfacial properties will be obtained.                                    Superparamagnetic constraint on the film                                        microstructures will be investigated.  In this study,                           we will also search for optimum film structure and                              material properties in developing the film for ultra-                           high density magnetic storage applications.  This                               modeling study will be combined with experimental                               research on the same type of films.  Available                                  experimental results and information on material                                and microstructure will be used to verify and                                   improving the modeling at all stages of the study.",
