The participants were 30-40             researchers who are actively working in this field, and included                graduate students embarking on research on this topic.  One third to            one half the participants come from North America, and most of the              others from Europe.  Both University faculty and industrial                     researchers participated.  The purpose of the workshop was to exchange          research results, to assess where the outstanding research problems             lie, and to have in-depth discussions of the research topics.                   This award supplied part of the transportation expenses and                     registration fees of those U.S. participants unable to obtain funding           from other sources.",
