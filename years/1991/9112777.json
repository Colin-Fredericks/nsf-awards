 "awd_abstract_narration": "Progesterone is an important steroid hormone for regulating many                aspects of physiology. It also has a number of effects on                       behavior. The research findings from Dr. DeBold's previous NSF                  grant showed that progesterone can affect behavior through direct               action on two specific sites in the brain, one in the forebrain                 and one in the midbrain. The primary objective of the present                   award is to determine how progesterone acts at its target site in               the midbrain to influence behavior. Steroid hormones generally                  exert their effects by entering cells, binding with a receptor                  inside the cell, and then the steroid-receptor complex acts on                  specific sites on the chromosomes to change the proteins that the               cell synthesizes. This mechanism of action has been found in                    virtually every cell that responds to steroid hormones. In the                  midbrain, however, progesterone appears to have its effect                      through a different mechanism. A form of progesterone which                     cannot enter cells can be effective in the midbrain, although it                is inactive elsewhere. The effect of progesterone on                            behaviorally-relevant actions via neuronal membranes will be                    tested. The specific protein which mediates this action will be                 determined. The proposed studies will demonstrate an alternative                mechanism of action for one class of steroid hormones. This work                will contribute to knowledge about how hormones act to regulate                 behavior.",
