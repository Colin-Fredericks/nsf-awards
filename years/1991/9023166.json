The workshop will provide an opportunity for                                    researchers, designers, and construction                                        specialists to exchange discussions and ideas                                   on the current state-of-the-art in seismic                                      risk assessment and design for lifelines.  In                                   addition it will determine future directions                                    to be pursued to improve current methods, and                                   establish what mutual programs between the                                      U.S. and Japan can be initiated so that the                                     most effective use of available information                                     is maximized.  The workshop will be conducted                                   in Los Angeles, in late summer of 1991.                                                                                                                         This workshop will be of great benefit for                                      the program development of the Earthquake                                       Hazards Mitigation Program as it will                                           identify future research needs in lifeline                                      systems research.  As an international                                          activity between the United States and Japan,                                   it will be of mutual benefit to both                                            countries in the development of lifeline                                        system earthquake -resistant design.",
