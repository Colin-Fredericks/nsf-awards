 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Colorado State University for the relocation of the Natural                     Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL) which houses interdisciplinary               ecological sciences research and research training activities to                the Biochemistry and Radiation Biology Building.  The Biochemistry              and Radiation Biology building was constructed in 1947 and last                 renovated in 1987.  The relocation is fully justified and cost-                 effective.  The ARFMP grant of $360,000 and $542,121 provided by                the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these                     research and research training facilities.  This project will                   address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by              relocating NREL to another space, which is being completely                     repaired and renovated, in the old Biochemistry and Radiation                   Biology Building and thus providing a research and research                     training space adequate in size and design and complete with new                wiring, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and fume             hoods that are adequate to accommodate the quantity, quality, and               diversity of research conducted in this burgeoning program.  The                Center for Analysis of the Dynamics of Regional Ecosystems (CADRE),             a multi-institutional and transdisciplinary center of excellence in             the ecological and atmospheric sciences, has just been approved by              the University.  The strength and the experience of the research                institute, NREL, which will be enhanced by this project, is one of              the cornerstones upon which CADRE is being built.                                                                                                               This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students in              an expanding program in ecosystems research that is of regional,                national, and international importance.  This project will assist               in the fulfillment of the University of Colorado's commitment to                enhance research on the effects of climate on arid and semi-arid                ecosystems through training of future scientists with a holistic                view of atmosphere-biosphere interactions.",
