 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research on the role that congressional                     committees play in determining the outcome of legislation on the                floor of Congress.  Legislative scholars have long been aware that              the decisions made by congressional committees are rarely                       overturned on the floor of the Congress.  However, some committees              are accorded much greater deference than others.  A number of                   explanations have been advanced to explain this pattern, though                 most of these are somewhat speculative and ad hoc.                                                                                                              This innovative research attempts to build upon existing                        explanations of committee floor success by developing a formal                  theory based on the assumption that legislators are rational actors             concerned with maximizing individual interest but guided by a                   central agent, in this case by party leaders. The theory will be                tested using detailed legislative histories of all bills reported               by standing committees in the 84th, 86th, 88th, 90th, 92nd, 94th                96th 98th and 100th Congresses.                                                                                                                                 When completed this project will help us better understand the                  dynamics of the legislative process that influence individuals to               cooperate for collective benefits.  Such an understanding of how                collective goods are produced in the highly decentralized                       environment which is Congress is essential for developing better                legislative strategies to cope with other collective goods problems             such as deficit reduction and campaign finance reform.",
