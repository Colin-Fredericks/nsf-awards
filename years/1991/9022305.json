 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of Nash equilibrium has become central in economics.                Researchers in fields such as industrial organization,                          international economics, economics of information, labor                        economics and bargaining theory have adopted it as the main                     theoretical tool for the analysis of interactive strategic                      behavior.  Yet the assumption that agents will play according to                Nash equilibrium is questionable because it relies on strong                    assumptions regarding common knowledge and full rationality of                  all agents.  The goal of this research is to determine under what               conditions profit maximizing agents learn to play according to a                strategic Nash equilibrium and what are the possible patterns of                the limit behaviors when they do not converge to a Nash                         equilibrium.  This is an important line of research because the                 experimental literature has shown that agents in repeated                       interactive situations do learn to play Nash equilibrium, but no                theoretical explanation for this phenomenon has yet been                        provided.                                                                                                                                                       The research in this project concentrates on rational learning in               long term interactions.  By rational learning it is meant that                  players choose actions that optimize their overall payoffs,                     present and future, with learning being included as part of the                 overall optimization problem.  However, unlike classical game                   theory, rationality will include no assumption about common                     knowledge of parameters of the game or strategies of the                        opponents.  The project extends a pathbreaking proof by the                     investigators that rational learning in two-person games leads to               Nash equilibrium if there is a \"grain of truth\" in the beliefs of               the players about each other's likely strategies.  These results                are extended to games with many players, games with imperfect                   observability, and to stochastically changing environments.  The                results will also be studied when players are not completely                    rational but use finite automata.",
