 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pattern recognition based control methods can produce stable                    and robust performance in a range of applications and these                     methods can be designed such that relatively little effort or                   expertise is required on the part of an industrial                              practitioner for implementation.  Artificial neural nets                        (ANNs) are well suited for pattern recognition applications.                    A strength of ANNs are their ability to interpolate and                         generalize pattern classifications, consequently they hold                      promise as an improved framework for pattern based controller                   design.  For example, ANNs can be trained to learn a process                    input - output relationship using historical plant data, and                    can then be installed online in the role of the internal model                  of an adaptive controller.  Another example is training ANNs                    directly in the error feedback relationship of a process and                    then using the ANN as the controller itself.  To maintain an                    accurate description, ANN based controller architectures must                   provide sufficient degrees of freedom to ensure plasticity,                     thus permitting system behaviors never previously experienced                   by the controller to be properly addressed.  The research                       project involves the use of pattern recognition to identify                     and represent current process characteristics while satisfying                  these requirements.                                                                                                                                             The focus of this work is the study of control systems that                     (1) are autonomous in their decision making for design,                         implementation and adaptation, (2) provide stable and robust                    performance over a wide range of applications, and (3) succeed                  in dealing with nonlinear, nonstationary systems.  The PIs'                     method of approach is to study an architecture comprised of                     several ANNs that each perform specific functions and                           integrate them into a unified design.  These functions                          include:  classification of the patterns exhibited in the                       recent histories of the manipulated input and controlled                        output to form a pictorial model of the current process                         character,  translation of this pictorial model into                            appropriate algorithmic controller parameters for use in any                    of a number of popular on-line controller algorithms,                           controller performance evaluation based on the patterns                         exhibited in the recent history of the controller error, and                    use of this performance evaluation in the unsupervised                          training of the pictorial to algorithmic translation mentioned                  above to improve performance and maintain stability in                          nonlinear and nonstationary applications.  The controller will                  be tested on a range of single-input single-output process                      simulations.  The processes will display a range of                             characteristics, including variations in process order, the                     degree of linearity of the process gain, the variability of                     the dominant time constant, the size of the signal to noise                     ratio, and with both slowly and suddenly changing                               nonstationary changes in the simulated process character.",
