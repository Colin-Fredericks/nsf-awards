 "awd_abstract_narration": "As issues of climate change, loss of biodiversity, ozone                   depletion and other global environmental problems come to center                stage in national and international policy debates, the role of the             state becomes increasingly decisive.  This project studies the                  nation state as a critical actor in shaping both the forces that                cause global change and human response to it.  Macro-social                     indicator data on nation states are used to develop and test                    a macro-comparative theory of state environmental policy.  The                  model includes such factors as citizen affluence, economic                      growth rates and capital stock, position of dependency in a world               economic order, structure of the economy, population pressure,                  class structure and education, the strength of the national                     environmental movement, scientific resources, level of democracy,               and cultural and institutional history.  Because measures of the                strength of the environmental movement and the strength of the                  environmental science community were heretofore unavailable, this               research project fills that gap by combining objective indicators               from secondary sources with assessments of a panel of experts in                order toy develop those measures.                                                                                                                                    This project adds to the comparative policy and                            international relations field by examining rigorously the                       importance of considering a nation's position in the world                      political economy as a determinant of the degree of state control               of the protection of the environment.  It contributes new                       understanding of what leads nations toward accepting various                    restrictions on their autonomy for the sake of protecting the                   environment.",
