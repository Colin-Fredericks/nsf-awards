 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small population sizes characteristic of endangered species                have several genetic consequences that can magnify the                          probability of extinction.  This proposal is concerned primarily                with the loss of fitness due to the  accumulation of mildly                     deleterious mutations.  The effectiveness of natural selection in               eliminating such genes is reduced when a population declines in                 size, and the consequent build-up of mutation load can cause a                  further reduction in population size.  This synergistic effect                  between chance effects of small population size and deleterious                 mutation leads to an extinction process called a mutational melt-               down.  Preliminary theoretical results demonstrate clearly that                 such a process can greatly increase the vulnerability to                        extinction within a fairly narrow time frame.                                        Dr. Lynch proposes to pursue the theory further in a number                of directions:  the influence of the mode of density-dependent                  regulation of population size, the form of the fitness function,                the consequences of fertility vs. viability mutations, melt-downs               in organelle genomes, and the additional contribution of mutation               load in the base population.  This work should greatly enhance                  understanding of processes at the interface of population                       dynamics and population genetics, an area of  special relevance                 to conservation biology that has scarcely been touched in                       previous studies.                                                                    Application of the theory to specific problems will require                quantitative information on the recurrent mutation load, which to               date is only available for Drosophila.  Such data are difficult                 to acquire, but are obtainable from self-fertilized lines                       maintained by single-seed descent.  Dr. Lynch will perform a                    series of very large, long-term experiments to acquire data on                  the input of mutations for fitness characters, using the rapid-                 cycling plant Arabidopsis as a model system.  The statistical                   theory for the analysis of data and for the optimal design of                   experiments has been developed.",
