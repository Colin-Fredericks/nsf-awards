 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research is to identify efficient                            (nonredundant) representations for correspondence problems in                   vision.  This research investigates the efficacy of new                         multiscale representations obtained from both classical wavelet                 and best-adapted wave packet bases applied to three matching                    problems:  stereo matching, texture discrimination and pattern                  recognition.  Multiresolution and orientation selectivity, known                biological mechanisms in primate vision, are ingrained in wavelet               representations and inspire the techniques presented in this                    proposal.                                                                          The multiresolution decomposition of wavelet transforms                      provides a natural hierarchy in which to embed an incremental                   stereo matching strategy.  In place of traditional hierarchical                 (coarse-fine) matching, a novel incremental strategy for stereo                 matching strategy is proposed, where matching is accomplished by                selecting bands of wavelet channels, constrained by orientation,                scale and geometry (space).  The approach to texture                            discrimination investigated the method of best-adapted wavelet                  packets for computing textural signatures.  The scale, frequency                and location (spacial) indices of the most energetic wave packet                coefficients will be analyzed.  Unique signatures shall be                      characterized by their links through 3-D scale space using the                  method of best-adapted wavelet packets.                                            Finding practical solutions to such fundamental problems will                have significant impact in the field of machine intelligence and                foster the development of applications in the areas of navigation               systems, robot vision, machine inspection, and image                            understanding.",
