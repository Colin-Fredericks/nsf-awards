 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nearly all nutrients lost from forested ecosystems pass through                 riparian zones where they may be accumulated or lost to downstream              transport.  However, the function of riparian forests in regulating             exchanges of nutrients between ground-water and streams is poorly               understood.  This research will examine the role of riparian                    forests in regulating nitrogen flux between hillslope forests,                  riparian forests and streams using a nitrogen budget approach.                  Data required will be (1) direction and rate of ground-water flow               and (2) concentrations of dissolved organic and inorganic nitrogen              in ground-water.                                                                                                                                                A study site located on a wide valley floor along a third-order                 stream in H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest will be used for this                project.  MODFLOW, a finite-difference ground-water flow model will             be paramaterized with data from a network of piezometers and used               to simulate flow paths of water; a tracer study will be used to                 validate model predictions.  Water samples will be collected from               transects of wells and analyzed for concentrations of dissolved                 nitrogen.  These data will be used to calculate changes in                      dissolved nitrogen concentrations along ground-water flow paths in              the shallow aquifer beneath the riparian forest and calculate a                 budget of nitrogen flux, via ground-water flow, between the                     riparian forest and stream ecosystems.                                                                                                                          The research program at H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest is                     recognized at national and international levels as a leader in                  forest ecosystem research.  Institutional support for this research             is exceptional.",
