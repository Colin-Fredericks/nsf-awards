The focus of the symposium is on cellular and molecular                         approaches associated with neuropeptide systems.  The aim is to                 provide a broad comparative scope and stress the applications of                these valuable techniques for the specific needs of the diverse                 audience that attends this meeting.  A roundtable discussion                    following the presentations will be used to evaluate and                        integrate the research strategies presented by the speakers.                    The participants represent a group of young investigators who are               directly active in the research and are establishing their own                  outstanding careers in this rapidly advancing area of                           neurobiology.  The proceedings of the symposium will be published               in the American Zoologist and, thus, accessible to scientists                   that did not attend this meeting but would benefit from a review                of the state-of-the-art approaches and techniques available to                  tackle important biological problems.  Finally, this symposium                  will be used to test the feasibility of forming a                               multidisciplinary division of neuroscience within the American                  Society of Zoologists.",
