 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site                    grant.  The award permits undergraduate students to participate                 in a research program in the materials field under the                          supervision of faculty members actively engaged in research.  The               REU Site at the University of Arizona is designed to integrate                  undergraduate students into already active and stimulating                      research groups in Materials Science and Engineering.                           Recruiting for students places high emphasis upon hispanic and                  other minorities as well as females, and places additional                      emphasis on attracting students from the surrounding Community                  Colleges, such as Pima Community College.  Funding provides for                 support of six students.  The program begins with a five week                   summer instructional program at the University of Arizona                       Materials Laboratory, and then progresses into the academic year                with more emphasis on research.  Skills taught in the summer                    portion include laboratory safety, mixing chemicals, running                    characterization instrumentation, analysis of data, and report                  preparation.  Students who show highest aptitude and desire will                continue to pursue their research participation during the                      academic year with matching funding support from the University                 of Arizona.  Students present their results in a seminar, and are               encouraged to publish the results in the appropriate scientific                 literature. The topics selected for the research include laser                  processing of sol-gel coatings, structure of thin ceramic films,                strengthening of inorganic glass by alkoxide coatings, and                      processing of glass-ceramics from lunar resources.  The program                 enhances current research activities as well as adding to the                   number of scientifically trained individuals.  It is hoped that                 this hands-on experience will serve as a stimulus to attract and                retain highly-gifted students into careers in teaching and                      research.",
