 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algorithm animation, the use of dynamic graphics to illustrate program          behavior and enhance understanding, has been successfully utilized as           a pedagogical aid. Typically, algorithm animation involves post-mortem          program augmentation:  graphics are designed and developed for already          working programs.  The techniques used in algorithm animation systems           could be adapted for use during program debugging.  The objectives of           this research are to use the abstract mental models developed by                program designers as a basis for program visualizations and to develop          a framework that allows programmers to quickly and easily (without              graphics coding) create an animated visualization of a program prior            to testing and debugging.  Such a framework then could be used to               examine program behavior and identify errors in a uniquely different            manner than traditional textual debuggers.  The intended deliverables           include (1) a description and implementation of a methodology for               mapping program data and actions to dynamic graphics, (2) a prototype           animation-based visual debugger, and (3) an analysis of the                     effectiveness of such a system.",
