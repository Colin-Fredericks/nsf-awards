 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of this study is the elucidation of                     the relationships between nucleation and growth processes, on                   the one hand, and the fundamental chemical processes of                         hydrolysis and condensation, on the other hand, in the sol-gel                  production of binary glasses and ceramics.  Understanding of                    this relationship is necessary to produce the desired                           homogeneity, bulk structures, and phase distributions in                        complex ceramics and glasses.  A systematic study of the                        effects of formulation and processing of binary glasses via                     the sol-gel process is conducted.  Several in situ techniques                   including infrared, Raman, and nuclear magnetic resonance                       spectroscopies are used to examine chemical kinetics, chemical                  transformations, and solid-state structures.  The physical                      evolution of the sol nuclei and the gel structure are followed                  with dynamic light scattering and dynamic  viscoelastic                         experiments of the evolving gel.                                                                                                                                The sol-gel process is a very important new technology for the                  production of high-performance glasses and ceramics.                            Applications of binary glasses and ceramics are found in many                   high-technology systems, including optical systems as fiber                     optics and light guides, chemical systems as catalysts and                      adsorbents, and electronic systems as dielectric and                            ferroelectric.",
