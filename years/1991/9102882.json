 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue experimental studies of the fluid                    mechanics of particle removal in turbulent boundary layers by                   suspension-feeding bivalve mollusks.  During this award period,                 extensive measurements of velocity and concentration (solutes not               particles) fields over two sets of model bivalves in a laboratory               flume will be examined.  The purpose of these experiments is to                 quantify the effects of near-bed hydrodynamics, i.e., the effects               of both the excurrent jets and the turbulent boundary layer flow,               on the flux of phytoplankton biomass from the water column to                   filter-feeding bivalves.  The information obtained in the                       experiments will be used in formulating and operating numerical                 models of phytoplankton biomass dynamics in shallow estuaries,                  like San Francisco Bay.                                                                                                                                         Experiments will also be conducted at the USGS flume facility to                determine the effect of near bed hydrodynamics on bivalve feeding               behavior.  In particular, the effect of cross flow velocities on                pumping rates, orientations, positions, and siphon heights of two               species of bivalves commonly found in San Francisco Bay will be                 examined.  This information is crucial to understanding the                     effects of concentration boundary layers on feeding strategies of               bivalves and will be used to interpret the results of the                       physical measurements made in the new facility at Stanford.                                                                                                     In its broadest terms, this project is focussed on understanding                the effects of hydrodynamics processes on benthic-pelagic                       coupling in estuaries and shallow coastal waters.  A major goal                 of the project is to translate that understanding into an ability               to predict how the flow environment in a given body of water                    might affect the nature of this coupling for whatever                           phytoplankton assemblages and communities of benthic suspension                 feeders might be present.  This is an excellent problem for                     illustrating how physical and biological processes are                          intertwined and how modelling might be used to develop an                       understanding of this coupling.",
