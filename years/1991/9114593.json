 "awd_abstract_narration": "A continuous solid-feed Czochralski (CCZ) growth process for               silicon single crystals will be researched.  By reducing the melt               height and keeping it fixed, this process can suppress many kinds               of unsteady kinetics and inhomogeneities.  The impurity build-up,               the oxygen incorporation and the resistivity in axial direction can             be much better controlled by continuously charging the polysilicon              and doping.  The design of a commercially viable CCZ process which              can produce crystals of much better quality and at lower costs will             be developed.  A three-dimensional numerical study of convective                transport processes involving heat, mass and momentum transfer                  together with the melting of solid pellets and solidification at                the melt/crystal interface will be performed to characterize the                process parameters suitable for continuous growth of crystals.                       Innovative techniques for flow visualization and heat transfer             experiments will be used to develop a basic understanding of                    thermohydrodynamic phenomena and pellets melting.  Based on this                information, suitable modifications in the present CZ crystal                   puller will be researched and the optimal conditions for CCZ growth             will be characterized.  Full-scale experiments will then be                     conducted at an industrial research facility.  This collaborative               research effort between the university and industry is expected to              lead to the development of an efficient, cost-effective CCZ unit                which should be of great importance to the United States                        semiconductor industry.",
