 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mauna Loa Observatory Photochemistry Experiment-II                     (MLOPEX-II), is an experimental program to study the chemical                   processing of nitrogenous, sulfurous, and carbonaceous compounds                in the remote troposphere through a detailed examination of the                 chemistry of ozone and other oxidizing species.  Two basic                      MLOPEX-II objectives have been formulated and are: to evaluate                  the concentration and variability of short-lived trace species on               diurnal, synoptic and seasonal time scales and to assess                        photochemical models of the remote troposphere over an annual                   cycle.  MLOPEX-II is a coordinated multi-institutional experiment               involving universities, NCAR, and NOAA.  The field portion of the               experiment will be conducted through four six-week intensive                    measurement periods, one in each season, and will be located at                 the Mauna Loa Observatory, HI.  The P.I. plans to make the                      following gas phase measurements as part of the MLOPEX-II                       program, batch measurements of hydrogen peroxide and specific                   organic hydroperoxides and formaldehyde.  The first year will be                spent making measurements, performing data reduction, and                       analyzing collected data.  The second year will focus upon data                 analysis and interpretation.",
