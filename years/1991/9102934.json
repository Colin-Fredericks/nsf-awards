 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in plasma                              physics between Loren Steinhauer of Spectra                                     Technology, Inc. of Bellevue, Washington and Roberto                            Clemente of the University of Campinas in Brazil.                               Measurements have shown edge-layer thicknesses                                  several times larger than expected for simple                                   outflow of plasma.  A promising explanation is that                             an electrostatic potential barrier is spontaneously                             established near the ends of the FRC (field reversed                            conviguration) which reduces the outflow rate.  This                            idea has never been modelled theoretically.  Since                              the edge-layer confinement is better than expected,                             the implications for a thermonuclear plasma may be a                            significantly reduced size requirement for a                                    reacting FRC.  The proposed research is to construct                            complementary models to explain the observed edge                               layer properties; a fluid-based model will be                                   developed by Clemente, and a kinetic model by                                   Steinhauer.                                                                                                                                                     The FRC concept is a highly promising fusion plasma                             concept with possible application to terrestrial                                fusion-electric energy (especially the low-                                     radioactivity D-3He fuel cycle), space-based power                              systems, and space propulsion.  The proposed work                               would benefit the U.S. FRC program by enlisting a                               researcher from another country in a project of                                 significant interest to an existing domestic                                    program.  The proposed work would also benefit the                              Brazilian effort on plasma physics by enabling one                              of its scientists to collaborate with a researcher                              at a laboratory where major FRC experimental and                                theoretical work is in progress.  In addition, the                              substantial computation skills at STI, including                                access to the National Magnetic Fusion Energy                                   Computer Center (Livermore, California) are                                     available in support of the research.",
