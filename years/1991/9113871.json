 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the early seventies there has been growing interest in using              the self-report method as a means of obtaining measures of juvenile             misbehavior.  The self-report method has now gained widespread use              among researchers, both in the United States and abroad.  During                a 1988 Nato Workshop on Self-Report Methodology in Criminological               Research, the idea of developing a large-scale International Self-              Report Delinquency Project (ISRDP) was proposed.  Leading                       researchers from fifteen countries examined how to develop a                    suitable cross-national instrument to measure delinquency.  After               some pilot tests, full studies are now being launched in the                    Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, North                 Ireland, United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.                                                                                                         This project is the United States part of the International Self-               Report Delinquency Project.  The objectives of the ISRDP are (1)                to examine cross-national variability in patterns of correlates of              self-reported misbehavior among youth and (2) to obtain measures                of cross-national variability in the relative rank ordering of the              prevalence of different types of youthful misbehavior.  Data will               be collected from a midwestern, urban community using a probability             sample of 1,000 youth between the ages of 14 and 21.  The                       researchers will collaborate with other participants in the ISRDP               on the analysis of the findings.                                                                                                                                International collaboration on the design, data collection, and                 data analysis of self-reported delinquency will provide a much                  needed stimulus to the advancement of our understanding of the true             nature and extent of youthful crime in modern industrial societies.             Participation in this unique research endeavor will allow further               exploration of the feasibility of collecting cross-nationally                   comparable self-report data using a standardized questionnaire and              will permit testing of the generalizability of theoretical                      propositions regarding the correlates of delinquency across                     different cultures.",
