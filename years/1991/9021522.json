 "awd_abstract_narration": "A mass spectrometer of special design is used to identify                  and measure ions in the atmosphere.  These ions are individual                  molecules of atmospheric gases bearing either positive or                       negative electrical charges.  The apparatus, developed over                     several years of laboratory work, is capable of extracting from                 the atmosphere ions existing in concentrations well below one                   part in a trillion, and injecting them into the vacuum chamber of               a mass spectrometer.  Measurement of the masses of the ions by                  the spectrometer permits their chemical identification.                                                                                                              An atmospheric-pressure flow tube into which specific ions                 can be injected is used for the measurement of trace atmospheric                species, including gas-phase sulfuric, methanesulfonic and                      malonic acids, pyridine, and ammonia, all of which are believed                 to be measurable at concentrations as low as 0.001 part per                     trillion in clean air.                                                                                                                                               Variants of the technique will be used to search for large                 naturally occurring ion clusters, and to study clusters formed,                 or charged, by specific ion species such as protonated pyridine                 or the nitrate ion.                                                                                                                                                  Ion-assisted measurements will be made of ozone, sulfur                    dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and possibly of the OH free radical.                                                                                                       The extreme sensitivity of these ion measurements opens up                 new possibilities of detecting, and measuring hitherto                          unsuspected low levels of atmospheric trace gases of natural or                 man-made origin, some of which may come from biological sources,                e.g., pyridine.  It is expected that these studies of the                       properties of atmospheric ions will help to clarify the molecular               details of the conversions of gases to particles in the                         atmosphere.  Implied in this is a better understanding of the                   nucleation of water droplets, and this of cloud formation.",
