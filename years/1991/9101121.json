 "awd_abstract_narration": "Few insect herbivores utilize Magnolia virginiana (sweetbay) as a               hostplant, one being the sweetbay silkmoth, Callosamia securifera               (Saturniidae).  However, closely related species suffer 100%                    mortality on this plant.  Preliminary phytochemical work indicates              that mortality is due to at least two insecticidal compounds,                   magnolol and biphenyl ether.  This study will characterize                      physiological/biochemical adaptations of C. securifera to Magnolia              by comparing its detoxification mechanisms with those of two                    congeners unable to tolerate this host's chemicals.  In vitro and               in vivo experiments will be used to identify enzymatic                          detoxification systems.  In addition, because the three Callosamia              species appear to have recently diverged and have some overlap in               host use, possible tradeoffs in digestive efficiency and                        detoxification enzyme activity that may have favored hostplant                  specialization in the genus will be tested.  Specifically,                      predictions that 1) specialists have higher digestive efficiency                than generalists and 2) generalists have higher levels or 3) higher             inducibility of broad substrate-specificity detoxification activity             than specialists will be tested.  With the detailed                             characterization of specific detoxification mechanisms used by C.               securifera to cope with toxins in its host, it may be possible to               formulate better hypotheses concerning biochemical tradeoffs                    associated with host specialization.",
