 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for the purchase of a photomicroscope equipped              with a video camera capable of detecting low light emissions, an                image processing and analysis system (for enhancement of image                  quality, quantification of data, and 3-dimensional reconstruction               of plant tissues), and a video recorder.  One of the primary uses               of this instrumentation will be in the analysis of gene expression              and protein localization during plant development.  In particular,              we will pursue investigations into the regulation of cell surface               proteins during embryogenesis (Dr. Grimes), the cellular basis of               calcium oxalate deposition in plants (Dr. Franceschi), and the                  temporal and spatial distribution of key enzymes involved in the                evolution of the C4 photosysthesis mechanism (Dr. Ku).  In these                studies, we will need to analyze low-level cell immunofluorescence              data, quantitate gene expression in specific cell and tissue types,             and perform image analysis and 3-dimensional reconstruction in                  order to develop a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms                involved in these processes.  This instrument will also be used to              probe the mechanisms of phloem unloading by in vivo monitoring of               fluorescent dye movement in sink tissues.  (Dr. Fisher).  To fully              understand phloem function, it is necessary to evaluate the data                in a structural context.  The use of 3-dimensional reconstruction               from sections of the tissues involved will be of central importance             for progress in this area.  The mechanism of malic acid                         accumulation into the vacuole of CAM plants is also being explored              (Dr. Uribe).  The use of fluorescent probes to monitor the                      energetics of the the vacuolar membrane in vivo will allow events               inside of a living plant cell to be visualized, as opposed to                   studies on isolated membrane fractions.  The requested                          instrumentation is critical to many aspects of the proposed                     research and will greatly enhance our capabilities for research in              plant cell biology.",
