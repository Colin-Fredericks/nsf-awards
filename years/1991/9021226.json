 "awd_abstract_narration": "While it is known that ovarian and adrenal steroid hormones are                 involved in the regulation of reproductive behaviors, the                       question remains as to the specific role that androgen and                      estrogen play.  While once considered a straightforward question,               it is now complicated by the finding that testosterone, the major               androgen, is metabolized into estrogen in peripheral and neural                 tissues.  Since strong evidence is accumulating to suggest a                    function for androgen in expression of female behavior in both                  humans and primates, it becomes imperative to know the identity                 of the hormone mediating each function.  Dr. Rissman has                        developed a model system to examine this important question.  She               uses members of a small primitive mammalian species of the order                of Insectivora which have a number of striking features similar                 to humans.  Dr. Rissman has designed a series of experiments to                 determine whether androgen is acting directly or by its neural                  metabolism to estrogen.  Once she has this information, Dr.                     Rissman will define the location in the brain where the hormone                 is acting.  These studies will provide important information                    towards understanding the underlying neural mechanisms.                         Moreover, this work could be very beneficial in prescribing                     hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women and women who have had                their ovaries and/or adrenals removed for medical purposes.",
