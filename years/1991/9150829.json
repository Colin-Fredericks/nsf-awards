 "awd_abstract_narration": "While at the professional level, the social sciences have a well-               defined body of tools to use in experimentation, at the                         undergraduate level, the focus remains primarily on the humanistic              roots of the disciplines.  The academy has long wrestled with the               problem of integrating theory and methods at appropriate                        undergraduate levels with scattered success.  Students seldom make              the connection between courses like econometrics and intermediate               macroeconomic theory.  Indeed, they tend to see econometrics as                 just another course, rather than the heart of economic scientific               inquiry.  Similar stories are heard in geography, sociology and                 political science.                                                                                                                                              By taking the method and theory courses separately, students do not             use method to reinforce theory and vice versa.  Beginning with                  second semester freshmen and sophomores, an introduction to social              science methods course would allow students to blend these ideas                from the start.  With appropriate laboratory exercises, students                would also have a broader understanding of the social sciences as               a whole and an appreciation for the similarities and differences                between methods used by each discipline.  This course will weave                quantitative method into the fabric of the social sciences.",
