 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid evolution of interactive and parallel computing has not               been accompanied by a similar evolution of languages to support                 these models.  This research is to investigate a programming                    model for parallel applications based on a declarative paradigm                 that has an interface with characteristics of popular spreadsheet               model of programming.  It includes multi-ways constraints and                   action procedures that can be triggered when constraints change                 the values of variables.  It will support general purpose                       programming and will handle flow-of-control problems which become               difficult in large projects with parallel processing.  An                       important advantage of the spreadsheet model is that it is a                    clear step away from the traditional batch processing approach to               the production of interfaces.  It is a step toward an interactive               environment for interface design which gives the end user control               of the development process.  Furthermore, it provides a mechanism               for programming parallel processes directly in an interactive                   manner.  The spreadsheet interface does not itself assume a                     specific underlying parallel processor architecture.  Likewise,                 it does not require the user to specify the details of flow-of-                 control, a serious problem for parallel processing.  An                         interactive capability, which also handles flow-of-control for                  parallel processing, is expected to impact industrial design                    cycles dramatically, particularly for large projects.",
