 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is proposed to further understand the structure,                       function, evolution and the regulation of synthesis of                          antinutrient proteinase inhibitor proteins that are present in                  plant tissues as defensive proteins against invading insects and                pathogens.  The proteins were first identified, isolated, and                   characterized in the PI's laboratory, and were subsequently found               to be synthesized in potato, tomato, and alfalfa leaves in                      response to insect attacks or to severe mechanical wounding.  As                part of studies of wound signal transduction systems that                       regulate the expression of proteinase inhibitor genes in plants,                the PI's lab has isolated and characterized several proteinase                  inhibitor genes from tomato and potato plants.  With these genes                they have been able to study the structure, organization, and                   regulation of proteinase inhibitor gene families that are                       expressed in response to both developmental and environmental                   signals.  They have recently discovered an 18 amino acid                        polypeptide as a new signaling molecule for the proteinase                      inhibitors, and have found a volatile signalling molecule for the               inhibitors, and have found a volatile signalling molecule for the               inhibitors, methyl jasmonate. In the interest of practical                      applications, several proteinase inhibitor genes have been used                 by the PI successfully to genetically engineer plants to improve                their defense against predators.",
