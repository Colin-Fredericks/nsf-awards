 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Solomon Sea is a small ocean basin 1000 km north of the                     Great Barrier Reef of northeast Australia that is gradually                     disappearing as the Papuan Peninsula of eastern New Guinea                      collides with the New Britain island arc.  This oblique                         collision has been completed along its western extremity and                    has resulted in the fold and thrust belt on the island of New                   Guinea.  Dr. Shor and colleagues Drs. Silver and Reed from UC                   Santa Cruz will  conduct a 32-day survey of the Solomon Sea to                  study the structural and sedimentologic processes involved in                   this collision process, the features of which are a                             contemporary analog to the Laramide orogeny that formed the                     eastern Rocky Mountains.  23 days of seafloor imaging will be                   conducted with SeaMarcII; these data will be supplemented by                    simultaneous collection of single channel airgun profiles, 3.5                  KHz echosounding records, magnetics and gravity.  7 days will                   be devoted to collecting piston cores, and during 2 additional                  days, bottom photographs will be collected.   Participants from                 the Geological Survey of Papua New Guinea and the Australian                    National University will join the cruise and conduct subsequent                 analyses.  The entire data set will make possible the                           comparison to structures and sedimentation observed onshore in                  the fold and thrust belt of New Guinea, and provide better                      understanding of orogenic processes.",
