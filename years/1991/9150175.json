 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development                  (OECD) is carrying out a series of case studies in science and                  mathematics education as a part of its continuing concern to                    provide more effective instruction for all of its populations.  As              the international community becomes more interdependent, not only               in economic activity, but in terms of environmental and other                   concerns, the degree of commonality held by the developed countries             in particular becomes more and more evident.  A key assumption of               the OECD Case Studies Project is that the context, characteristics              and implementation of an innovation that is interesting and                     important in one country will in many instances be significant in               other nations, as well.                                                              The proposed project will carry out up to ten case studies in              science, mathematics and technology education.  The studies will be             selected with a view to representing exemplary practice in the                  United States.  The framework for the studies has been devised by               science, mathematics and technology education experts at OECD                   conferences (attended by U.S. specialists).  The actual work will               be carried out in the United States by the co-principal                         investigators and their associates, with the advice of a panel of               nationally recognized experts in science, mathematics and                       technology education.",
