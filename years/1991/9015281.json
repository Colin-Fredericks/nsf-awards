 "awd_abstract_narration": "Willsky         There are three major components of this research program  which has as its overall objective the development of new classes  of algorithms for statistical signal processing and estimation of  spatial and multidimensional data.  The first is the development  of statistical models and methods for multiscale signal analysis  and processing in one and several dimensions.  Problems that are  being addressed include the development of a statistical  counterpart to the emerging theory of multiresolution signal  decompositions and wavelet transforms, the investigation of  iterative, multigrid signal processing algorithms, and  applications of these methods to topics ranging from inverse  reconstruction problems to problems of signal or image  segmentation.         The second is the development of efficient algorithms for  processing spatial data.  This topic focuses on the exploitation  of the structure of noncausal models, such as those described by  partial difference equations or Markov random fields, in order to  develop extremely efficient and highly parallel algorithms.   Specific problems being investigated include the employment of  radially inward and outward recursions for multidimensional  signal processing, parallel processing structures based on  spatial partitioning of multidimensional signal processing, and  the development of efficient algorithms for tracking motion and  other temporal changes in space-time random fields.         The third is the development of statistical methods for  estimating or reconstructing geometric features in  multidimensional data given uncertain measurements of various  quantities, such as the support of a convex object in 2-D or 3-D,  or the 2-D silhouette of 3-D objects.",
