 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Vertebrate Paleontology collection of the Oklahoma                     Museum of Natural History includes more that 30,000 specimens,                  collected primarily from the southern plains of the U.S.   The                  collection is an important regional repository for fossil                       vertebrates, and ranks 15th among U.S. collections of its type.                 Most of the collection was amassed during the 1930s and 1940s                   under the direction of J. Willis Stovall, first Director of the                 Museum.  Following his death in 1953 the collection was neglected               and fell into disrepair, but through the efforts of Dr. Richard                 Cifelli, appointed as Curator in 1986, the collection has been                  restored to a high level of activity.  Approximately one-fourth                 of the collection has been restored, cataloged, reorganized, and                transferred to modern storage cabinets.  Dr. Cifelli proposes                   another phase in the collection's restoration, during which                     fossils of Cenozoic age (mostly mammals) will also be brought to                a high level of curation.                                                            The proposed collection improvement project will salvage an                important research collection, and will make it easily accessible               to visiting investigators and through loans.  Natural history                   collections such as this are essential resources for research on                evolution, biogeography, and global change.  Continued growth and               improvement of these collections will benefit many generations of               researchers.",
