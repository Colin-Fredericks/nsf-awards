Sponsorship is by the NASA Goddard Space                Flight Center, Data and Computing Division, the University Programs             Office, the Equal Opportunity Office, and NASA Headquarters.                         This project is to support the September 25-27. 1991 meeting               of the MU-SPIN Users Working Group at the Goddard Space Flight                  Center.  The meeting is to provide a forum for the exchange of                  ideas on networking to support interdisciplinary research.                           Funding will support the cost of participant travel, meals,                and meeting arrangements.  The project is directly related to the               interests of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering               Directorate in that CISE is actively supporting programs to enhance             the opportunities of underrepresented populations in the computer               field.  Access to adequate facilities, and the interchange made                 available by network connections is an important aspect of this                 effort, and the program of the workshop should enhance the                      opportunities of the participants.",
