 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a collaborative program in the                              organic chemistry of magnetic semiconductors between                            the research groups of Fernando Galembeck (Campinas,                            Sao Paulo, Brazil) and Janos H. Fendler (Syracuse,                              New York).  Nanosized magnetic and magnetic-                                    semiconductor particles will be prepared by                                     methodologies developed by the Brazilian group and                              will be incorporated into bilayer lipid membranes                               and Langmuir-Blodgett films currently in use in the                             U.S. group.  They will be characterized by                                      absorption spectrophotometry, scanning tunneling                                microscopy, and by measuring electrochemical,                                   electro-optical, and magneto-optical properties in                              the U.S. scientist's laboratory.  Important and                                 complementary characterization by transmission                                  electron microscopy, Mossbauer and ferromagnetic                                resonance spectroscopy will be carried out in the                               Brazilian laboratories.                                                                                                                                         The research will result in the development of                                  novel, nanosized magnetic and magnetic-semiconductor                            particles which will have potentially important                                 applications as electro-optical, magneto-optical,                               and magnetoelectro-optical devices.  The relevance                              of the proposed research to high-technology                                     applications will serve to motivate students, whose                             training will be an integral component of the                                   cooperation.  Brazilian students will work in                                   Syracuse and U.S. students will do likewise in                                  Brazil.",
