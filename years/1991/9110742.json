 "awd_abstract_narration": "The adsorption of proteins to solid surfaces is encountered in                  many fields of science and technology.  In many cases, protein                  adsorption is a favorable, if not a necessary component of the                  application and yet the exact nature of the adsorption                          mechanisms and interfacial structures has not been determined.                  The outstanding questions in the area of protein adsorption to                  solid surfaces include: 1) the determination of the surface                     conformation and preferred orientation of adsorbed molecules,                   2) an understanding of competitive adsorption effects, and 3)                   the ability to predict surface properties based on the chemical                 components of the solid and protein alone.  This project will                   answer several of these questions by application of the fairly                  young technique of waveguide Raman spectroscopy to the study of                 interfacial protein conformations.  The specific applications                   are to understand protein adsorption to polymer filtration                      membranes encountered in bioprocessing and solid-phase                          immunoassays.  In conjunction with macroscopic adsorption                       studies, e.g., adsorption isotherms and the determination of                    adsorbed thicknesses, the waveguide Raman studies will provide                  detailed molecular structure information concerning the                         adsorbed states of proteins on these types of biopolymer                        surfaces.  One of the advantages of waveguide Raman                             spectroscopy is that structural information can be obtained                     from both the adsorbed protein layers and the underlying                        polymer substrates.  Another advantage lies in its ability to                   determine orientational information about adsorbed layers.  By                  correlating the data obtained in the macroscopic and molecular                  level experiments, it will be possible to gain predictive                       ability in the understanding of protein-polymer interactions.                   %%%                                                                             Research Planning Grants enable women who have not had prior                    independent Federal research support to develop a competitive                   research project.  This project involves the use of waveguide                   Raman spectroscopy for the study of interfacial interactions of                 proteins with solids.  Such interactions occur throughout                       nature but are not well understood.  This project will lead to                  a better understanding of these processes.",
