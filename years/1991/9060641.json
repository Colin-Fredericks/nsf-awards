 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proton exchange membrane (PEM) based fuel cells are the power                                                                                                   system of choice for many applications including electric                       vehicles, but they require complex water recirculation and                      humidification systems for effective operation.  Three anion                    exchange membranes identified in preliminary experiments                        conducted at ElectroChem form the basis for the proposed                        development of novel anion exchange membrane (AEM) based fuel                                                                                                   cells.  The membranes are OH ion conductive, chemically stable                                                                                                  in hot caustic, and are not fouled by CO2.  It is anticipated                                                                                                   that AEM fuel cells will have all the advantages of PEM fuel                    cells, namely, no free electrolyte-associated materials                         problems, high power densities, and good reliability.  AEM's                    are expected to have favorable water transport properties and                                                                                                   would eliminate some of the problems related to water                           management, resulting in system simplification.  It is further                                                                                                  anticipated that the advantages of alkaline electrolytes--                      rapid oxygen reduction kinetics and the possible use of non-                    noble metal electrocatalysts--will be maintained without the                    problem of CO2 intolerance.  The result should be a simple,                     compact, and efficient power system for terrestrial and space                                                                                                   power applications.",
