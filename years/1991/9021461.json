 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Holekamp and her colleagues are continuing their field study                of behavioral development in the spotted hyena.  Spotted hyenas                 live in complex, primate-like societies, called \"clans,\" with 5                 to 100 members.  Whereas female hyenas remain in their natal                    clans for life, all young males eventually emigrate.  Each hyena                clan is structured by a rigid, linear dominance hierarchy, or                   \"pecking order.\"  Spotted hyenas differ from most other mammals                 in that females are socially dominant to males among adults.                    Coalitions in which one animal joins an aggressor against a third               individual occur frequently and may function importantly in the                 development and maintenance of rank relations in hyena societies.                                                                                               This phase of the research has three goals:  (1) to document the                development, causes, and consequences of coalitionary behavior;                 (2) to determine why males emigrate from their natal clans, how                 they become integrated into their new social groups, and how                    dispersal influences their social rank; (3) to elucidate the                    mating system in the study population.                                                                                                                          The 80 hyenas being studied comprise one large clan in the Masai                Mara National Reserve, Kenya.  The age, social history, and kin                 relations of each clan member are known from previous study.  The               researchers are using radio tracking, behavioral observation, and               molecular-genetic analysis of paternity.  The research will help                elucidate (1) the causes and consequences of mammalian dispersal                behavior, (2) the development and maintenance of social                         dominance, and (3) the social biology of large carnivores.",
