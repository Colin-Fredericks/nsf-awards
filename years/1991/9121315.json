 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a collaborative effort between Clemson University,          Bowdoin College and University of Connecticut to investigate two                modifications to the first two years of the undergraduate computer              science curriculum.  The first modification broadens the focus of               these courses from primarily software development techniques to                 consider the breadth of the computer science discipline.  The second            change blends the use of scheduled, structured laboratories with the            traditional lecture approach.                                                                                                                                   This approach follows the recent ACM '91 curriculum recommendations.            Project activities will include the development and class-testing of            lecture and text materials, and laboratory materials.  The laboratory           exercises will be developed for a variety of educational settings.              The results of the curriculum and materials development will be                 disseminated through summer workshops, publications, and presentations          at professional meetings.",
