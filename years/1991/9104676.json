 "awd_abstract_narration": "Africa appears to be the place in which our earliest ancestors                  evolved.  While the original discoveries of these earliest                      hominids were made in South Africa, most of the recent                          discoveries have been in East Africa. There are nonetheless many                sites in South Africa which are potential sources of fossils                    which could shed light on a multitude of exceptionally important                questions related to the early stages of our evolution.  For                    instance, we are uncertain as to the ages of the South African                  fossils known to date, their relationship to the East African                   materials, the numbers of species represented, the tool-                        manufacturing capabilities of the South Africans etc.  All of                   these are of clear importance in elucidating human evolution.                                                                                                   Yet, looking for fossiliferous sites is a truly risky                           undertaking.  Sites may be searched in vain for years on end and                thus programs are hesitant to invest in projects which have a                   limited likelihood of \"paying off.\"  The current proposal                       requests funds to survey a region of South Africa which is known                to contain limestone deposits of the appropriate age.  No                       systematic survey of these deposits has yet been undertaken and                 the PI intends to determine which breccias have indications of                  bearing fossils, more precise ages of the deposits.  The PI has                 done some prior work in an area to the north and east.  There are                                                                                               reasonable geological and paleontological reasons to think that                 the caves here to be investigated may prove to be fossiliferous.",
