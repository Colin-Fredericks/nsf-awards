 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a long-term visit by Professor Ronald                   W. Wolff, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations                   Research, Engineering Systems Research Center, University of                    California, Berkeley, to Japan for a cooperative research                       project with Professor Masakiyo Miyazawa at the Science                         University of Tokyo and Professor Genji Yamazaki at the Tokyo                   Metropolitan Institute of Technology.  The researchers will                     investigate several topics in queueing theory that have                         applications to model manufacturing systems and communications                  networks as follows:  1) Bounds and Approximations for Queues                   and Queueing Networks.  Generally performance measure for                       queueing networks cannot be determined exactly, but must be                     approximated.  They will investigate the errors in these                        approximations in several ways including light-traffic                          analysis.  For tandem queues they will investigate bounds on                    the difference in performance measures for different                            arrangements of the order of the servers.  They will also look                  at some unsolved problems about bounds and approximations for                   simple single-and multi-server queues.  2) Conditions for                       Finite Delay Moments.  The formal derivation of approximations                  and bounds often involve the requirement that certain terms                     either cancel or are small.  This in turn requires that                         certain delay moments be finite.  Recent progress has been                      made in this area and the researchers believe they can                          contribute further knowledge to the problem.  3) Fundamental                    Properties of Queues.  They will investigate applications of                    attained waiting time to queues, where one of the objectives                    is to find new bounds on performance measures.  Finally,                        they will investigate simplifications to existing theory that                   may result from the merger of different approaches, such as                     the application of sample-path methods to the marked point                      processes.                                                                                                                                                      There is a large amount of research currently taking place on                   queueing theory in Japan.  Thus it is an excellent opportunity                  for Professor Wolff, who is one of the outstanding queueing                     theorists in the world, to collaborate with Professors                          Miyazawa and Yamazaki who are also world renown                                 in the field.  Each researcher brings a unique capability to                    the effort yet each is also experienced in the work of the                      others.  It is expected that this collaboration should                          provide some exciting results as well as continued cooperation                  between the researchers for years to come.",
