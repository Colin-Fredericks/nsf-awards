 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Duke University Marine Lab at Beaufort, North Carolina,                is one of the country's most active centers for marine research                 and for graduate training in oceanography.  The University has                  recently commissioned the Research Vessel Susan Hudson, a 57' ship              for coastal ocean research.  Dr. Joseph Ramus, Director of the Duke             University Marine Lab, has requested shipboard equipment for water              sampling and for collecting plankton and bottom samples.  The                   University also proposes to renovate the pier and dockside                      electrical facilities for the new research vessel.                                   The proposed instrumentation and facilities renovation will                have an immediate impact on the many resident and visiting students             and researchers at the Duke University Marine Lab.  The R/V Hudson              will begin her active career earlier and with more immediate                    capabilities for research and teaching.  The proposed improvements              will convey significant benefits to a wide audience of biologists               and oceanographers.",
