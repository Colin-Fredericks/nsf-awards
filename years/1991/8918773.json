 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a one-year collaborative project between                Professor Robert L. Hemminger, Department of Mathematics, Vanderbilt            University, and Professors Derek Holton and R.E.L. Aldred, Department           of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New                Zealand.  The activity takes place under the U.S.-New Zealand                   Cooperative Science Program.                                                                                                                                    The cooperating mathematicians will carry out joint research in                 various aspects of graph theory.  The subject matter will primarily             include (1) the distribution of contractible edges and (2) the                  neighborhood connectivity of graphs.  These are important areas of              study in modern graph theory, and Professor Hemminger and his New               Zealand colleagues are respected researchers in the field.  Their               previous collaboration has been productive, and the current studies             will build upon and expand their earlier results.",
