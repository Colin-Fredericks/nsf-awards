 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This proposal supports the collaboration of                       Drs. T.W. Kerlin and B.R. Upadhyaya of the University of                        Tennessee (UT) and Dr. Ozer Ciftcioglu of Istanbul Technical                    University (ITU) in Turkey.  The expected theoretical and                       implementable results of this collaboration should yield new                    information on: 1) behavior of reactor process signals; 2)                      cause of variations in plant signatures; 3) use of signal                       fluctuating components for instrument fault monitoring; and                     4) use of non-invasive tests for component surveillance and                     preventive maintenance. The proposed research will be                           carried out at both UT and ITU.  Dr. Ciftcioglu is an expert                    in the area of alarm reliability algorithms for stochastic                      processes whose expertise will integrate well with                              activities already underway at UT involving instrument                          calibration verification and on-line monitoring of smart                        sensors.  The UT scientists will visit the facilities at ITU                    and the ITU participants will visit UT.  Additionally, a                        four-day workshop will be held in Istanbul in order to                          exchange information.                                                                                                                                           Scope:  This project in engineering systems will enable                         leading experts in the United States and Turkey to combine                      complementary talents and pool research resources in areas                      of strong mutual interest and competence.  Dr. Ciftcioglu                       will have an opportunity to become familiar with research                       techniques and facilities at UT and, likewise, Drs. Kerlin                      and Upadhyaya will benefit from the time spent in Istanbul.                     Therefore, this proposal fulfills objectives of the Science                     in Developing Countries Program in its exchange and transfer                    of scientific knowledge through an international                                collaboration.",
