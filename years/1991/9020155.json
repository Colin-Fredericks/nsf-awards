 "awd_abstract_narration": "A stable genetic mechanism for sex determination is a                      prerequisite for the maintenance of separate sexes in a species.                This in turn requires that those genes promoting or suppressing                 female and male expression be located on the same chromosome.                   Chromosomal sex determination, uncommon in plants, is widespread                in animals and is almost invariably accompanied by morphological                differentiation of the X and Y chromosomes.  The relatively                     recent origin of sex chromosomes in plants means that, in many                  cases, closely related species which lack sex chromosomes, also                 exist.  The existence of variation in sex chromosome                            differentiation within a closely related group of plants provides               a model system for the study of the origin of sex chromosomes.                       We are studying Y chromosomes in Silene to test theoretical                predictions concerning their structure and function.  A DNA                     library will be generated from Y chromosomes of Silene alba                     isolated using flow cytometry, a technique applied with great                   success to the human genome.  The resulting Y-specific DNA probes               will be cross hybridized with chromosomes of male and female S.                 alba, as well as the other close relatives.  Our expectation is                 that the Y chromosome will have some regions which are                          structurally similar to the X.  The existence of structurally                   different regions serves to prevent recombination that would                    disrupt the \"active Y\" sex determination found in Silene.",
