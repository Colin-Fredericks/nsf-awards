 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of synapsids is documented by an unusually rich                   fossil record, extending over 300 million years.  Primitive                     synapsids, the pelycosaurs, are the most conspicuous terrestrial                vertebrates of their time, and their fossil remains record the                  earliest successful adaptive radiation of amniotes to a broad                   array of herbivorous and predators modes of life.  The PIs will                 undertake a thorough reassessment of the phylogenetic                           relationships of pelycosaurs by combining detailed anatomical                   studies of specimens with a cladistic analysis that considers a                 large suite of characters.  Their first hand knowledge of this                  group, previous studies of numerous pelycosaur taxa, and                        availability of representative specimens of three outgroups for                 direct osteological comparisons will eliminate the need to rely                 heavily on outdated literature.  In addition to providing an                    assessment of the ingroup relationships of pelycosaurs, the                     present study will assess the relationship of pelycosaurs to                    other Paleozoic vertebrates, including their therapsid                          descendants.  Computer algorithms that utilize cladistic                        techniques will be used to analyze phylogenetic relationships.                  This project will provide a solid basis for the analysis of the                 paleoecology and paleobiogeography of pelycosaurs.  The PIs also                expect to be able to construct a macroevolutionary model of the                 group and to address the perplexing problem of the origin of                    amniotes (higher vertebrates that include recent reptiles, birds,               and mammals).",
