The organizers of the meeting are Dr. Ralph S.                       quatrano and Brian K Kay. the conference is composed of five                    sessions: 1) Gene Expression in Development; 2) Signal Pathways                 in Development; 3) Cell Determination and Differentiation; 4)                   Transgenic Systems; and 5) Cell-Cell Interactions. In order to                  advance the participation of junior members within the region,                  the sessions will be composed of 20 minute talks by junior                      faculty and 10 minute talks by postdoctoral and graduate                        students; to draw the interest of those not giving platform                     talks, we have invited three nationally prominent developmental                 biologists to give keynote addresses. In addition, all                          participants will have the opportunity to present posters. This                 meeting will provide an excellent opportunity for scientists and                their students from Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South                   Carboline, Georgia, and Florida to meet and exchange ideas and                  information on developmental biology. Based on the attendance of                recent meetings, 1--125 participants are expected. Partial                      support is requested from NSF to help defray room expenses for                  graduate students and postdocs attending the Conference, travel                 expenses of students and keynote lecturers, facility rental and                 mailing/advertising expenses.",
