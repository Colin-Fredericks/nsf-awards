 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is related to the goal of increasing the number and             quality of American workers in Science and Engineering (S&E)                    careers, including women and minorities, inorder to increase                    national productivity in these areas and our ability to compete in              world markets.  A related issue is the underrepresentation of                   female and minority students in science and mathematics courses in              precollege education as well as the low entry and retention rates               of undergraduate students in S&E programs in higher education.  The             purpose of the study is to obtain longitudinal data that provide an             understanding of what has happened in the formative adolescent                  years and what has happened to S&E career aspirations in the                    intervening years leading to young adulthood.  The study has three              phases: (1) The first phase, funded by the National Institute of                Education, was carried out in 1980 when data were collected from                9th and 12th grade students in 2 rural, 2 suburban, and 2 inner                 city schools.  These were randomly selected sites throughout                    Illinois.  (2) The second phase is the collection and                           interpretation of follow-up questionnaire data obtained in 1990.                (3) The third phase is to interview participants who expressed a                strong interest in an S&E career in 1980 or are currently in an S&E             career.  The interview will be designed to provide information                  about why some persisted in this interest and others did not.                   Working with the Illinois State Board of Education and the Illinois             Board of Higher Education personnel, strategies for increasing                  interest, participation, and performance in science and mathematics             career will be proposed for implementation at the high school and               college level based on the findings from this study.",
