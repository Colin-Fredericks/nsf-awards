 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on a concept for                           improving the rate at which petroleum hydrocarbons with a                       high-carbon content, can be removed from soil that has                          been contaminated by leakage from underground storage                           tanks.  The investigator plans on evaluating anionic                            surfactants that have an enhanced affinity for the target                       hydrocarbons because of their chemical structure, and                           comparing their performance in this respect with cationic                       and nonionic surfactants.  The investigator plans to                            includes the evaluation of surfactants with the use of                          micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration, a surfactant-based                           separation process for treatment of the wash water after                        it has been circulated through the contaminated soil.                           This process in combination with the appropriate anionic                        surfactant has the potential of providing for recovery of                       the surfactant for reuse in the soil-decontamination                            process.                                                                                                                                                        This proposal was submitted in response to Program                              Announcement NSF 88-99, Research Initiation Awards.                             Results are expected to improve the engineering design of                       chemical remediation systems that are used to remove                            petroleum hydrocarbons from soil that has been                                  contaminated by leakage of petroleum hydrocarbons from                          storage tanks.",
