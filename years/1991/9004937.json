 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goals of this research are to improve the application               of spin trapping to phagocyte cells and to better understand the                free radical biology of phagocytic cells.  Using the spin trap 4-               POBN, the investigators have demonstrated that 1-3% of oxygen                   radical formed can be trapped as hydroxyl radical in a                          myloperoxidase-mediated reaction.  These results will likely                    resolve a conflicting body of literature.  The next aim will be to              complete work with 4-POBN.  A second goal is to clarify the                     localization of spin trapping agents.  This will be determined by               using fluorescent spin trapping probes with confocal microscopy.                Finally, during the course of the coming year, studies of the role              of lactoferrin in hydroxyl radical formation will be completed.                                                                                                 This research will continue development of techniques for the                   application of spin trapping to the study of biological systems and             will contribute to understanding of free radical events within                  phagocytic cells.",
