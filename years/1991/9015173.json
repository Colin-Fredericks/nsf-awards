 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer communication networks are becoming increasingly                  important for integration of administrative, engineering design,                and production processes in the large-scale manufacturing business.             The efficiency and flexibility of networks for computer-integrated              manufacturing (CIM) can be significantly improved by using optical              fibers as the transmission media.  Since the physical                           characteristics of optical fibers are significantly different from              those of coaxial cables, the topology and medium access mechanisms              in the existing CIM networking architectures need to be revised.                     The objective of this research is to conduct basic and applied             research in integrated office and factory communication networks.               The research will focus on the development and analysis of a high-              speed fiber-optic-based network protocol that will integrate real-              time distributed manufacturing processes with engineering design                and plant management databases.  Projects of national importance                like (1) Manufacturing Automation Protocol, (2) Technical                       and Office Protocols, and (3) Integrated Services Digital                       Network will directly benefit from this research.",
