 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the participation of six US                     scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on the \"Physics of                       High Power Laser Matter Interactions\".  The seminar will be                     held on March 9-13, 1992 in Osaka, Japan.  The co-organizers                    are Professor George Miley, Department of Nuclear Engineering,                  University of Illinois and Professor Sadao Nakai, Institute                     of Laser Engineering, Osaka University, Japan.  Specific                        topics to be discussed at the seminar include (1) laser                         plasma interactions; (2) radiation and atomic processes and                     energy transport; and (3) physics and applications of high                      density plasmas to fusion, accelerator, x-ray lasers and                        industrial processes.  This will be the fifth seminar on this                   topic dating back to 1972, the last being held in 1988.                         Since then there have been a number of rapid developments in                    the field and it is therefore timely to hold another seminar.                                                                                                   The seminar will concentrate upon the physics of laser                          interaction with various media ranging from solids to                           plasmas.  Using powerful lasers, unique high-density plasmas                    can be generated.  Much fundamental research is being                           undertaken aimed at understanding the processes involved in                     these laser-plasma interactions and at developing applications                  for laser produced plasmas.  The United States and Japan have                   two of the most advanced laser laboratory facilities in the                     world and researchers from both countries have made a number                    of very important contributions to the field.  The seminar                      will permit representatives from several research groups in                     the two countries to meet and exchange information which                        should lead to more extensive research collaboration.",
