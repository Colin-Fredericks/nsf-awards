 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most significant differences between eutherian                         (placental) and metatherian (marsupial) mammals involve their                   modes of reproduction and development.  Metatherians are born at                a premature state relative to eutherians, and complete                          development while attached to the teat, nursing.  The                           evolutionary consequences, advantages and disadvantages of these                metatherian and eutherian strategies form the basis of an                       extensive literature.  Yet, most details on the differences in                  morphological development are unknown.  The proposed study will                 examine development of craniofacial features in metatherians and                eutherians and is intended to form the first part of a long term                study of craniofacial development in mammals.                                                                                                                        The focus of this specific project is on a detailed                        comparison of craniofacial development in two species,                          Monodelphis domestica (Didelphidae, Marsupialia), and                           Meoscricetus auratus (Rodentia).  These are hypothesized as                     representative taxa for the two groups.  Data on rate of                        development, on sequence of differentiation, and on coordination                of developmental events will be collected for both species.                     Focus will be on the bones, muscles and nerves of the head.                     These data will then be applied in a preliminary manner in                      phylogenetic comparisons in order to assess the generality of                   patterns observed in these representative taxa and to form                      hypotheses on appropriate characters for further examination of                 the polarity of developmental events in placental and marsupial                 mammals.",
