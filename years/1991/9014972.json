 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides partial support for Dr.                     Amiya Sen to spend three months as a guest scientist at the                     Institute of Plasma Research (IPR) in Ahmadabad, India.                         During that period he will be conducting theoretical                            physics and mathematical modeling research on the control                       of disruptions in the ADITYA Tokamak at the IPR.  The                           concept to be investigated is the use of active feedback of                     the instability leading to the disruption.  Two possible                        schemes will be examined, a helical coil suppressor, and a                      modulated neutral beam suppressor.  The Indian team, headed                     by Dr. A. Sen of the IPR, will design and carry out the                         experiments for this research which are expected to                             continue for a much longer period after the visit of the                        U.S. scientist.                                                                                                                                                 Scope:  This cooperative research between the U.S.                              scientist and his Indian counterpart should be beneficial                       to the two countries.  The U.S. P.I. has made a short visit                     to the IPR last year to discuss arrangements for the                            proposed research.  As a result an official invitation was                      issued by the IPR for him to spend his sabbatical leave                         there.  That invitataion has been approved by The                               Government of India.  This project meets the U.S.-India                         Cooperative Science Program criteria.",
