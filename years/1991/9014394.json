 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oxidation of organic compounds is of concern in fuel                        cells, synthetic electrochemistry, pollution control, and gas                   sensing.  The complexity of the desired reactions allows                        opportunities for unwanted side reactions to occur, with the                    formation of undesirable blocking intermediates.  To perform                    organic oxidations without such complications, there is a need                  for the proper metal surface to facilitate adsorption and                       cracking of molecules, as well as powerful oxidizing                            conditions to overcome strongly bound intermediates.  The                       latter conditions are found, but are not limited to situations                  where oxide semiconductors such as n-ZnO, N-TiO2, and                           n-SrTiO3A are used as the catalyst.  The PI plans to combine                    the desirable properties of both metals and semiconductors to                   achieve an advanced catalytic electrode for facile oxidation                    reactions by fabricating the electrode to take advantage of                     the hot hole effect.                                                                                                                                            He is planning studies of dark injection and photo-injection                    of hot holes into thin metal films over n-type and p-type                       semiconductor substrates.  His hot carriers (holes) are                         available in the dark, and he will use metal films to                           radically alter the catalytic properties of the semiconductor                   surface.  The method features the formation of excited states                   at metal surfaces that have, in the past, been created only by                  high energy photoemission into the liquid electrolyte.  The                     physical and chemical properties of hot holes will be                           investigated with emphasis on oxidation of organic species                      such as CO and methanol and their oxidative intermediates.",
