The               contractor will generate detailed statistical tables displaying                 survey results and provide technical support as needed.                              As part of its requirement under the National Science                      Foundation Act, as amended, to provide a central clearinghouse                  for the collection, interpretation, and analysis of data on the                 current and projected availability of scientific and engineering                resources and personnel in the United States, NSF collects and                  disseminates statistical data on detailed characteristics of                    graduate science and engineering enrollment in academic                         institutions.  Data derived from this survey series are used by                 internal NSF management and the National Science Board. as well                 as by analysts at the Federal, State, and institutional levels to               predict changes in the supply of scientists and engineers and, in               combination with demand projections based on other sources, to                  generate early warning of possible imbalances of supply and                     demand.",
