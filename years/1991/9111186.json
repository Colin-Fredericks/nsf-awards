 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop a series of empirical                 studies that implement existing models of efficient contracting,                labor demand, agency relationships, and investment in the presence              of rent-seeking employees.  A major innovation in this study is the             use of French microdata to be analyzed using a collection of                    computer files that allow for simultaneous analysis of individual               employees, establishments, and enterprises.  For the employees,                 compensation information and skill measures are available.  For                 establishments, employment and compensation levels in various                   occupations, industry, compensation and information on revenues                 are available.  For enterprises, detailed financial, employment and             investment information are available.                                                                                                                           This research is important because it will provide a detailed and               comprehensive summary of the relations among the various components             of compensation system design, employment at various skill levels               and fundamental measures of firm performance.  In addition, because             the PI has analyzed similar data for US and Canadian companies, an              effort will be made to estimate some models that are directly                   comparable.  This should contribute directly to the ongoing inquiry             as to the appropriate framework for modeling negotiated wage rates              and the resulting employment demand.",
