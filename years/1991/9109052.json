 "awd_abstract_narration": "In molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, the                     energy of a many-body system must be computed repeatedly for                    millions of configurations.  It is therefore essential to use                   theories and algorithms that allow for fast calculations.  In                   quantum chemistry, the extended Huckel method is one of the most                economic theoretical approaches for calculating energies.                       Although simple, this method gives sufficiently accurate results                in appropriately selected applications.  A combination of                       molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations with the extended                Huckel method should therefore be useful in studying dynamic                    phenomena near surfaces and in the solid state.  The proposed                   research will study the reconstruction of the Si(111) ( 3 x  3)                 R30 -B surface structure using the extended Huckel method and                   Monte Carlo simulation.                                                              Density functional theory is ideal for extended systems and                large molecules.  Although computationally intensive, it tends to               give excellent results especially for free-electron systems.                    Central in this theory is that the ground state energy is a                     unique functional of the electron density.  There is no need for                any iteration in density functional calculations.  The second                   focus of the research will be to continue explorations of the                   combination of density functional theory and computer simulation                to study dynamic processes in condensed phase systems.",
