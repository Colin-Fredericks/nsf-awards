 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dome-shaped uplifts of high temperature-low to medium pressure                  metamorphic rocks with cores of Cretaceous granite are flanked by               high pressure-low temperature Jurassic (?) blueschists in the                   Seward Peninsula of Alaska.  The origin and tectonic setting of                 these complexes is controversial, and their uplift has been                     attributed to thermal relaxation following crustal thickening.                  Preliminary new work in the Kigluaik Mts. indicates patterns                    of deformation, metamorphism and magmatism that are similar to                  those in Cenozoic metamorphic core complexes of the Basin and Range             province.                                                                            Field mapping, structural analyses, andgeochronologic/                     thermochronolgoic studies will elucidate the timing and mechanism               of uplift of the blueschists rocks on Seward Peninsula.  Areas of               concentrated study include:  the highest structural levels exposed;             low angle faults between feebly metamorphosed Paleozoic rocks and               greenschist to blueschist facies rocks beneath; and the high                    temperature core rocks of the domes.  This approach will also                   establish whether uplift was single or multi-stage.  The results                will bear on the age, regional tectonic setting, and uplift of                  blueschist facies rocks in N. Alaska and will address the possible              history of extension leading to the offshore shelf region beneath               the Bering and Chukchi Seas.  The results will also provide insight             on the interplay between magmatism, metamorphism and strain in                  regions of the crust that undergo large vertical uplift.",
