Supported by National Science Foundation                                        researchers have carefully documented and jointly published on a                number of issues concerning the interfacing of phonology and                    grammar in Luganda.  The project has centered around three areas:               1)the analysis of prosodic features (quantity, tone, accent, and                intonation, which impact, respectively, on theories of                          syllabicity, tonal representation, metrical representation and                  phonetic implementation); 2)the analysis of prosodic domains                    required by these features (the phonological word, clitic group,                tone group, tone phrase, and intonational phrase); and 3)the                    nature of the syntax-phonology interface (i.e. determining                      whether-or under what conditions-the phonology may directly                     access the syntax, rather than indirectly accessing the syntax by               mediation of the prosodic domains).  As is documented in the                    proposal, the current project has resulted in breakthroughs in                  each of these areas.  First, by closely scrutinizing the complex                data of Luganda, the researchers have discovered that the \"facts\"               (which have been cited by a number of theoretical phonologists)                 are not always exactly as the standard references indicate.                     Second, the discovery of these facts has led the researchers to                 theoretical innovations which they have explored and propose to                 investigate further in this final phase of the project.  These                  innovations include a refinement of moraic theory (particularly                 as it relates to complensatory lengthening and the question of                  what is a tone-bearing unit); a new contour representation of                   underlying tone in Luganda (and perhaps a subclass of so-called                 pitch-accent systems); a cyclic approach to morphology and                      phonology that allows affixes to be \"infixed\" rather than added                 to the periphery of their base; extension of overlapping prosodic               domains to the lexicon; and testing of these results against the                lexical prosodic domains required by the segmental phonology                    (e.g. for vowel height harmony, consonant mutation, consonant                   nasalization (the \"Ganda (for \u0131Meinhof's! Law\"), etc.  Renewed                  funding from the N.S.F. will thus allow the PI and Dr. Katamba to               complete their productive collaboration and attend to the                       discoveries that have arisen thus far in the project.",
