 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, a zeolite film (membrane) is grown on a                        polymer film.  To accomplish this, tetralkyl ammonium ion                       templates for initiating zeolite growth are attached to the                     surface of the polymer film by long hydrocarbon chains.  The                    zeolite, as it forms, grow a channel around the hydrocarbon                     chain.  The resultant hybrid film is evaluated for separation                   of gas and liquid solution as prepared and after removal of                     the polymer film.  It is planned to produce a silicalite                        membrane on a cellulose ester film which will be applicable to                  the separation of nitrogen/oxygen and ethanol/water solution.                   This will establish the basic principles for expansion of this                  technology to many other separation applications.                                                                                                               The development of highly selective membranes will have many                    benefits including purer, more competitive products, decreased                  pollution and energy savings.  Zeolites with their molecular                    sized channels and variable chemical affinities have already                    demonstrated high selectivity in many applications.  The                        availability of zeolite films would lead to much broader                        applications of membrane technology.",
