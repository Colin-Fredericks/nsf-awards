 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. William H. Dantzler,                 Department of Physiology, University of Arizona, to pursue with                 Dr. Varanuj Chatsudthipong, Department of Physiology, Mahidol                   University, Thailand, for a period of 24 months, research on the                renal tubular transport of organic anions.  The studies will                    involve a continuation and expansion of work on organic anion                   transport steps at both the basolateral and luminal membranes of                mammalian renal tubules.  They will utilize isolated perfused and               nonperfused renal tubules in vitro to test, in intact tubules,                  the model, based on data from membrane vesicles, that organic                   anions are transported into cells against an electrochemical                    gradient.  They will utilize similar techniques to evaluate                     p-aminohippurate transport across the luminal membrane in intact                tubules and evaluate possible anion exchange and the involvement                of inorganic ions in this transport process.                                                                                                                    These studies are important in gaining an understanding of how                  kidneys function and in making a comparison of kidney function in               reptiles and in mammals.  This project adds an international                    cooperative dimension to the PI's research under NSF Grant No.                  DCB-9001985.  The collaborators are highly respected scientists                 who have a record of successful prior cooperative research.  This               project is relevant to the objectives of the Science in                         Developing Countries Program which seeks to increase the                        level of cooperation between U.S. and developing country                        scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific                     information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                          collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
