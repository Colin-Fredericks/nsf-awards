 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two year research program in response to the joint                    NSF/EPRI program announcement on ADvanced Polymeric Materials.                  Strong, durable, and lightweight composites are suitable materials              for construction of electrical transmission structures.  This                   research is aimed toward the development of composite members with              superior properties at reasonably low cost for construction of                  power transmission tower structures.  A novel composite processing              method will be studied which combines the braiding process with the             pultrusion process to make composite members with a uniaxially                  reinforced core and a braided sheath.  Composite structural members             from such process will be evaluated and compared with pultruded                 (uniaxial reinforcement only), pultruded with ordinary off-axial                reinforcement (e.g. winding), and braided parts.  The evaluation                will include theoretical analysis and experimental assessment of                joint strength, shear resistance, and compressive behavior.  Aging              study (e.g. UV, temperature, humidity), field test, and cost-                   benefit analysis will also be conducted, in corporation with the                Transmission and Distribution Research Laboratory of the Georgia                Power Company.",
