 "awd_abstract_narration": "The second half of the nineteenth century was a period of                       extraordinarily rapid urbanization in the United States.  The                   growth of cities was fueled both by the migration of the native                 born into urban areas and by the arrival of unprecedented numbers               of European immigrants.  Yet, few studies have attempted to                     investigate the effects of urbanization on the economic welfare                 of the population.  The purpose of this study is to close this                  gap by analyzing economic experiences of the populations of two                 major cities, Boston and Chicago.  The principal source evidence                will be the manuscript returns of the federal censuses of                       population of 1850-1870.  By observing the wealth of sizeable                   samples of individual households in the two cities, questions in                three basic categories can be addressed.  First, were the cities                a place of unusual economic opportunity?  Second, how did                       immigrants fare in comparison with the native born?  And third,                 how did the urban experience differ between the frontier and the                longer-settled East?  This research will lead to a much fuller                  understanding of the effects of urbanization on economic welfare,               and  to new insights into the progress of immigrants in the                     American economy.",
