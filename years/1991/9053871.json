 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provide 20-25 undergraduate women (recruited                      from SIUC and seven surrounding community colleges) with an                     intensive two-week workshop in the sciences to expose them to                   science career options. Sciences include mathematics,                           zoology, chemistry,plant ecology, geology, psychology, animal                   sciences, and microbiology. Activities cover such fields as                     molecular biology and recombinant DNA, assessing ecological                     integrity, gene expression after bacterial transformation,                      geologic  hazards, and biotechnology of mammalian embryos. Two                  additional single day workshops and three individual                            mentoring sessions will follow throughout the academic year.                    Women scientists from industry give seminars during both the                    summerand academic year workshops to expand  participants'                      perceptions of science career options. A second group of                        women will be recruited for the second year for a total of                      40-50 participants.                                                             Measurable objectives designed to measure project                               effectiveness include:                                                                                                                                               - The number of participants with undeclared majors who                           select science majors.                                                                                                                                        - The number of participants who decide to become                                 science teachers.                                                                                                                                             - Of participants who do not enter a four-year college                            (e.g., for economic reasons), the number who enter                              science-oriented careers with their two-year degree.                                                                                                          - A significantly lower drop-out rate (including change                           to a non-science major) than among the general                                  population of women science majors.",
