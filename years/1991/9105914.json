 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action permits Dr. Frison and his colleagues to continue                   archaeological excavation at the Helen Lookingbill archaeological               site which is located at an altitude of 8600 feet in northwestern               Wyoming.  Previous work has demonstrated that the site contains                 stratified deposits which date from ca. 10,000 to 5,000 years                   ago.  The rich and well-preserved faunal and lithic remains                     contain a record of human activity which spans the Paleoindian                  and Early Archaic periods.  The team will continue careful                      excavation with exact plotting of individual pieces.  Faunal and                lithic remains will be analyzed and supplemented with a number of               other studies. Additional work on site geology will provide clues               to site formation processes.  Such work on a broader regional                   level combined with pollen analysis should show how climate                     changed over time in this high altitude area and thus provide a                 backdrop for the understanding of human response.  The region                   will also be surveyed for available stone sources which will be                 chemically characterized.  Lithic materials from the site will be               matched to these to give a picture of broader environment use.                                                                                                  While many archaeological sites have been excavated in the                      adjacent Great Plains region, relatively little is known about                  how native American populations adapted to the harsher high                     altitude environments.  From information to date it appears that                a different cultural trajectory was followed in this latter                     region and that agriculture was not adopted.  To understand human               adaptation, it is necessary to excavate rich stratified sites                   with long cultural sequences and to date them accurately.  The                  Helen Lookingbill site provides an excellent opportunity for                    this.                                                                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons.  It will increase               our knowledge of a relatively unknown region of North America.                  It will shed light on how human societies at a simple level of                  technological organization adapt to a harsh and changing                        environment.  It will also further development of excavation and                recording techniques pioneered by Dr. Frison and his colleagues.                These will have widespread archaeological applicability.",
