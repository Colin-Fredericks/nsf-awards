 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electronics industry has shown considerable interest in                     semiconducting compounds with specially tailored electrical and                 optical properties for fabrication of a variety of electro-optic                devices such as photodetectors and IR and visible lasers.  One                  method that is commonly used to tailor the properties of various                materials is adjusting the composition.  This method has been                   exploited very successfully in case of materials as HgxCd1-xTe                  and GaxAl1-xAs where the change in composition results in                       changing Bandgap.  This program will investigate a new material                 based on the wide bandgap semiconducting system HgBr2-HgI2 which                form the ternary material, HgBrxI2-x, mercury bromoiodide.  The                 bandgap of this ternary compound depends on the ratio of bromine                to iodine in the crystal lattice and can be tuned by changing                   this ratio.  The bandgap of HgBrxI2-x can be varied to cover                    almost the entire visible region of the electromagnetic                         spectrum.  Such a material can be used in a wide range of                       electro-optic applications.  The goal of this program is the                    method to prepare, purify and grow single crystals of HgBrxI2-x                 and to characterize the optical and electronic properties of this               material and to investigate the variation in these properties                   with changing composition.",
