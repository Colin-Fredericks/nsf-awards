The congress is organized by Dr. K.N. Majumdar of                       the Institution of Engineers (India).  Among topics to be                       covered are: geological hazards, including earthquakes and                      land slides; atmospheric hazards, including hurricanes and                      severe storms, droughts, and floods; social science                             perspectives, including mitigation planning, social theory,                     trends, global change, policy and application, group                            behavior, policy and institutional analysis; and                                engineering and environmental management.                                                                                                                       Scope:  It is planned that eight U.S. scientists covering                       the different topics will participate.  They are expected                       to convey lessons learned and approaches to hazard                              reduction in the U.S., to make contacts with Indian                             researchers who are developing plans for the International                      Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, and to visit Indian                      institutes involved in research in these areas.  This                           project is likely to increase the interaction and                               cooperation between scientists and engineers in the two                         countries.",
