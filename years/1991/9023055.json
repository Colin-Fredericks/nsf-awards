 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program will bring together elements of neural                    networks, stability analysis, and experimental economics.  The                  purpose of this research is to develop and test theory for the                  evolutions of decision-making in dynamic oligopoly environments.                Imagine that agents learn about each other and their environments               through repeated institutional interactions, and adapt their                    decisions in light of the information they acquire.  So guided by               institutional rules and informational restrictions, an                          agent's decision provides a local gradient to make predictions                  about statistical regularity of decisions made.  Such neural                    network models can be shown to be generalized versions of dynamic               oligopoly models based on adaptive decision-making rules.  A set                of appropriate experiments with human subjects to validate and/or               aid in amending the theory will be carried out.                                                                                                                 This project will focus on simple quantity setting or price setting             oligopoly environments.  Each agent involved in the learning                    process makes a simple decision and gets information and a reward               before making  another decision.  These environments are simple                 enough that the computation of theoretical equilibria (e.g.,                    noncooperative Nash equilibria) is achievable (though sometimes                 requiring numerical methods), and is testable through controlled                experimentation with cash motivated human subjects.  Understanding              the dynamics of decision-making in these simple,environments                    portends the successful examination of more complex scenarios where             policy issues may be at stake.  For example, how do long term cost              reduction (R&D) investments interact with short term pricing                    decisions; how can a few influential (large) buyers alter the                   decision-making influence the evolutions of market concentration                and the distribution of market shares?",
