 "awd_abstract_narration": "The condition of the housing stock long has been one of the most           important indices of material well-being within communities.                    Geographers and other social scientists have devoted considerable               attention to analyses of the state of housing in the United States in           the 20th century, especially in the period since World War II.  Much of         the nation's housing was built prior to this century, however, and              investigations of the quality of this older housing should examine not          only its current status but also the form and character of that housing         during earlier historic periods.  This project consists of a detailed           empirical investigation of the condition of American housing in the             years immediately around 1800.  Data from the 1798 federal tax on               dwellings will be related to data from the 1800 population census to            provide an overview at the township level of the number, nature, and            quality of housing units in those early days of the nation.  Analyses           of these data will test hypotheses about the impacts of the frontier,           traditional regional structures, climate, and proximity to major roads,         rivers, and urban centers on the housing stock.  Special emphasis at a          larger scale will be given to housing in wards and townships of the             Philadelphia area in order to determine the role of intrametropolitan           location on the geography of early 19th century housing values.                      This project will link two valuable historical databases using a           geographic information system, thereby greatly enhancing their utility          for further inquiries by this investigative team and by other scholars.         Analyses of these data will significantly enhance statistically based           understandings of relationships between many external factors and the           quality of housing in the early years of the nation, and it will shed           light on the historic causes of substandard housing within the U.S.             The employment of undergraduate students as members of the research             team to assist in data entry and analysis will provide valuable                 experience for promising undergraduates.",
