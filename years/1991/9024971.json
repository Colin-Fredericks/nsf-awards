 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the work is development of a simple reproducible                    method for assaying for the presence of functional ion channels                 in planar lipid bilayers.  Improving upon liposomal ion flux                    assays and electrical measurements employing BLMs, patch                        electrodes, or whole cells would greatly facilitate routine                     testing for ion channel activity in biophysical and biochemical                 research.  The technique of patch clamping bilayers formed from                 monolayers would serve well if it were not so irreproducible.  We               propose to test a new approach at forming stable planar bilayers                that will lend itself well to such a new assay system--this is to               support bilayers on planar hydrophilic surfaces perforated by                   small single orifices containing one Ag/AgCl electrode each.                    First we will fabricate planar silicon and glass structures with                small hydrophilic holes.  Lipid bilayers will then be formed                    across those holes by passing the device twice through an                       air-water interface covered by a lipid monolayer with or without                ion channels.  Measurement of the function of the nicotinic                     acetylcholine receptor in such bilayers will be made with                       conventional electrophysiological techniques.",
