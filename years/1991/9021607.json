 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge compilation (KC) converts explicitly represented domain               knowledge into an efficient algorithm for performing a task.  KC                technology could have a major impact in fields depending of                     efficient problem-solving algorithms.  For, example, productivity               in circuit and mechanical design has grown increasingly dependent               on efficient computer-aided design (CAD) tools.  KC techniques                  can accelerate CAD tool development and improve CAD tool                        reliability.  This work will develop knowledge compilation                      techniques for a variety of CAD applications.  Initially the work               will focus on spatial configuration problems.  Such problems                    arise in many domains, including VLSI design, mechanical design,                and architectural design.  It will focus on synthesizing search                 algorithms composed of such components as generators, testers,                  and hillclimbing patchers organized into one or more levels of                  abstraction.  The research will develop an investigate a divide-                and-conquer approach to KC:  A problem specification is                         partitioned into parts; each part is assigned to be implemented                 as a particular type of algorithm component.  This approach                     should avoid the control problems that arise in unrestricted                    transformational models of knowledge compilation.  Expected                     benefits of the research include articulated principles for the                 synthesis of design algorithms, knowledge compilers implementing                such principles, and new CAD algorithms resulting from their                    application.",
