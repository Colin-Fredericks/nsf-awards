 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Rockefeller University for the renovation and repair of the                     Protein Sequencing Facility which houses protein chemistry and                  bipolymer research, research training, and research services that               are integral to the research of over 100 Rockefeller University                 investigators in biochemistry and in cell and molecular biology.                This building was constructed in 1930 and last renovated in 1982.               The ARFMP grant of $275,000 and $424,461 provided by the grantee                as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                    research training facilities.  This project will address the need               to improve the current research infrastructure by (a)                           consolidating into one location the activities of protein                       sequencing, peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis, and amino acid               analysis; and (b) installing the necessary utilities so that a                  hydrofluoric acid hood and cleavage apparatus and an Applied                    Biosystems peptide synthesizer can be operated.                                                                                                                 This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for supplying vital research                  services to an excellent faculty widely known for the                           significance of their biological research and for the training of               quality graduate and postdoctoral students.",
