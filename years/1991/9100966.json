The REU program is conducted in               conjunction with an ongoing Undergraduate Summer Research Program,              sponsored by the Texas Engineering Experiment Station for the past nine         years, and the Minority Engineering Program.  Students for the REU              Program are selected from institutions that have predominantly minority         enrollments including the University of Texas at El Paso, University of         Texas at San Antonio, Pan American University, University of Puerto             Rico, and Prairie View A&M as well as Texas A&M University, with at             least half from other institutions.  Individual research projects are           undertaken by the undergraduate students in conjunction with on-going           research programs, and regular faculty involved in these programs serve         as advisors for the participants' research activities.",
