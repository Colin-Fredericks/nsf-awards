 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two overall goals:  (a) to                                     develop basic experimental data on the                                          torsional-translational response of                                             reinforced concrete structures in order to                                      test the theory and improve numerical models                                    for nonlinear behavior and (b) to seek                                          relatively simple methods of representing the                                   problem for design applications.  Results of                                    the experimental work will be evaluated by                                      studies toward the goals indicated using                                        nonlinear and modified linear models to                                         represent observed behavior.  Both dynamic                                      interaction and material interaction                                            affecting the coupled structural response                                       will be investigated.                                                                                                                                           The experiments involve a specially designed                                    specimen which is free to rotate about its                                      horizontal and vertical axes.  The tendencies                                   for rotation about Y and X are resisted by                                      reinforced concrete beams.  The inertia force                                   is eccentric with respect to the vertical                                       axis.  The specimen configuration and the                                       associated experimental setup permits the                                       independent variation of mass, stiffness, and                                   strength from specimen to specimen.  Study                                      will include earthquake-simulation testing of                                   eight specimens to investigate the effects of                                   type of earthquake motion, stiffness, and                                       strength on combined torsional-translational                                    response.                                                                                                                                                       The project targets at the intersection of                                      theory and experiments, and through                                             deliberately simple design of the test setup,                                   tests existing theories and makes                                               straightforward dynamic modeling possible.",
