 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to enable students in the                           physiology laboratory to study the temporal patterning of                       extracellularly recorded neuronal activity.  This is to be                      accomplished through the use of a high speed 12 bit analog to                   digital conversion board and complementary display and                          analytical software.  Processing would be handled by a 386 SX                   computer and high resolution hard copy would be obtained with                   a laser printer.Specific applications include recording                         patterns of activity in cockroach leg sensory axons in response                 to mechanical stimulation of leg spines and changes in                          cockroach ventral nerve cord activity in response to cercal                     nerve stimulation.  The software will enable isolation of                       single units through window (amplitude) discrimination and                      waveshape recognition as well as analysis of action potential                   frequencies.      These capabilities are expected to                            significantly enhance students' understanding of neuronal                       coding by allowing them to collect and quantitatively analyze                   temporal patterning over longer periods of time than would be                   the case when using a digital storage oscilloscope.",
