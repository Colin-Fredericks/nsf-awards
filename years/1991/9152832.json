 "awd_abstract_narration": "We plan to improve our curriculum in biology by expanding and                   improving laboratory exercises in plant cell culture in our                     Botany and Introductory Biology courses, and by including them                  in a new course, Biotechnology in Theory and Practice.This                      year, we made a modest beginning in Botany by culturing African                 violet leaf tissue, growing callus tissue from hypocotyls of                    sterile Brassica rapa seedlings, and making vacuole                             preparations from flower petal cells.  We are excited about the                 outcome of the B. rapa exercise, and are developing additional                  plant culture exercises from it.  Students enjoyed working with                 B. rapa because the seedlings and callus tissue grew so fast.                   They also enjoyed isolating the large, colorful vacuoles from                   flower petals.  The vacuoles gave them a new way to study the                   effects of hyper- and hypotonic solutions.Now we want to                        incorporate more sophisticated manipulations of plant cultures,                 such as shoot culture and morphogenesis, and for that we will                   need the controlled light and temperature conditions provided                   by growth chambers.  We also need to maintain suspension                        cultures of plant cells for protoplast isolation, cloning of                    single cells, and nutrition. experiments, and for those we need                 gyrotary shaker.",
