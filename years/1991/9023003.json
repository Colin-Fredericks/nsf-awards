 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a comparative study of social and economic                factors affecting food production in four Micronesian societies.                Cultural anthropologists will study interactions among food                     production, consumption, and exchange within households in two                  female farming societies (Yap and Palau) and two male farming                   societies (Kosrae and Marshall Islands).  Communities within each               of the four societies vary with respect to level of food                        production, economic and political articulation with the world                  system, the importance of cash, and the degree of urbanization.                                                                                                                                                                                 Data will include in-depth interviews as well as community                      surveys of social and economic behavior.  Case history materials                on household activities will be collected from a sample of                      households.  Formal analyses of the relations between attitudes,                goals, and economic behavior will be done.  This research is                    important because adequate food production in local communities                 is a cause of concern in much of the world, and a comparative                   study like this one will advance our understanding of the social                and cultural causes  of variations in food production.",
