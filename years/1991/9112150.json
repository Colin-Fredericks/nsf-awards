 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research supported by this award will investigate an                   approach to a conformal mapping theorem for non-Riemannian metrics.             The principal investigator will try to extend the method of circle              packing which was used to give a proof of the standard Riemann                  mapping theorem. He will also undertake a study of infinite circle              packings and try to describe the relationship between the shape of              an infinite circle packing with prescribed combinatorics and the                rigidity of such a structure.                                                        This research is an extension of the classical theorem which               says that a simply connected two dimensional domain, one without                holes, is equivalent in a very precise way to a disk, a plane or a              sphere. A method of proving this theorem involving a packing of the             domain by circles was discovered several years ago. This research               involves questions raised by this new proof. The theorem itself is              used in a very crucial way in computing flow over airfoils and the              recently discovered proof opens up new possibilities for more                   efficient computations of flows.",
