Pectins will be featured for                        overall classification and determination of glycosidic                          linkages.  In their work, the researchers intend to                             develop and employ a new set of cyanine dyes that react                         with amino groups for absolute configuration of alkaloids                       and amino sugars.  (These dyes are chosen for unique                            spectroscopic properties, requiring only nanogram sample                        quantities.)  Results are expected to extend the                                methodology for determining microstructure of complex,                          irregular polysaccharides such as pectin and would allow                        for the determination of absolute configurations of                             small amounts of rare sugars and the frequency and                              points of branching in glycosidic linkages.                                                                                                                     This project in organic chemistry fulfills the program                          objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading researchers in the United States and Eastern                            Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                                research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                           and competence.",
