 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is                   made to Dr. Ruth J. Williams of the Department of Mathematics,                  University of California, San Diego.  Dr. Williams will continue                working in her research interest in probability, specifically on                stochastic processes.  Her primary focus to date has been on                    multidimensional diffusions and their applications in physical,                 biological and social sciences, as well as in engineering.  She                 plans to investigate stochastic integral equations and nonlinear                PDE's and their connection with stochastic processes.                                The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality                of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                  potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                 research, the academic profession, and the education of future                  scientists.  Dr. Williams will continue her work on stochastic                  processes, an area of probability theory.  Particulary noteworthy               is her appointment to an Associate Editorship to a leading                      journal of probability.",
