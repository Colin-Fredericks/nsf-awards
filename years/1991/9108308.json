The U.S. physicists will lecture at                        an International School of Physics planned for September                        1991 in Leningrad on the theme of \"The Standard Model in                        High Energy Physics\".  This funding will cover the                              travel expenses of the U.S. physicists; the Physical                            Society of the Soviet Union will cover their living                             expenses while lecturing.
