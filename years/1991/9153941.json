 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drexel University will conduct a two-year program to enable                     58 elementary school teachers to become mathematics teaching                    specialists who will do all the grades 1-8 mathematics                          teaching in 10 elementary and 3 middle schools in the School                    District of Philadelphia.  The 13 Principals from                               participants' schools will also participate in the program.                     The project will improve the content knowledge, pedagogical                     skills and assessment techniques used by the participants.                      Mathematical content knowledge will include estimation,                         measurement, probability and statistics, transformational                       and projective geometry, topology, applied mathematics and                      problem solving.  Participants will learn to use diagnostic                     teaching strategies in teaching mathematics and will                            incorporate assessment as an interactive feedback device to                     focus instruction.                                                                                                                                              The project will involve the private sector in creating a                       video tape resource library of activities concerning real                       world mathematics applications for classroom use.  It will                      engage private sector engineers and scientists in one-to-one                    mentoring partnerships with teacher participants.  The                          project will also involve the active participation of the                       Franklin Institute Science Museum.  Participants may earn                       11.5 graduate quarter credits which may be applied toward a                     Master's degree.                                                                                                                                                This project has the potential for causing systemic change                      in grades 1 through 8 mathematics instruction in the School                     District of Philadelphia.",
