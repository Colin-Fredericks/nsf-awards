 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an SGER (Small Grants for Exploratory Research)                    award.  Tropical tidal flat deposits of the Western Atlantic may                contain a unique strip-chart-like record of variations in climate               during the past few thousand years.  The locally-adhesive                       surfaces of these flats act like fly-paper to retain aerosols                   from Africa and centimeter-thick layers of marine sediment record               the passage of hurricanes.  Both the frequency of hurricanes and                the flux of aerosols from Africa reflect global-scale variations                in climate.                                                                          To explore this potential record of climate variations, a                  series of cores will be collected for sediments that have                       accumulated continuously for the past 3000 years or more.  The                  sediment layers that record major storms will be logged and their               compositions determined; the aerosols will be extracted from the                inter-storm algal layers, weighed and their compositions                        determined by x-ray diffraction and optical microscopy.  To date                the storm layers and determine rates of accumulation of aerosols,               sections of the cores will be dated by radiocarbon and possibly                 with thorium230.                                                                     This pilot project may produce a local record of hurricane                 frequency and the flux of aerosols and by applying the method to                other tidal flat deposits, it is possible to develop the record                 of a much larger area.  This exploratory research is important                  because, if successful, it will provide information of storm                    frequency under different global climate regimes.",
