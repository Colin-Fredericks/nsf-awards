 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the winter the temperature becomes sufficiently low                 for sea water to freeze in high latitude polar regions.  The                    layer of ice on the sea may thicken to over two yards in depth.                 As the following spring approaches, microorganisms begin growing                in the lower foot of the sea ice.  This community of sea ice                    microorganisms is dominated by sea ice algae that grow to                       sufficient density to impart a red to brown color to the lower                  layer.  Bacteria derive nutrients from the ice algae and grow                   with them in the layer.  Although considerable work has been                    performed on the sea ice algae, little is yet known about the                   kinds of bacteria that grow in this cold environment.                                Dr. James Staley of the University of Washington has                       collected sea ice bacteria from both antarctic and arctic zones                 and has discovered novel forms, some with specialized gas                       vacuoles in their cells.  Using standard bacteriological tests as               well as newer molecular methods of DNA analysis, including                      ribosomal gene sequencing, Dr. Staley is characterizing the                     various bacterial strains collected from polar sea ice.  One                    objective is to determine whether the same species of bacteria                  occur in both the north and south polar ice communities.  Another               objective is to assay the range of taxonomic diversity present in               the two geographically separate regions.  Knowledge about true                  cold-adapted bacteria would have eventual implications for                      decomposition and waste disposal in polar regions and cold marine               waters.",
