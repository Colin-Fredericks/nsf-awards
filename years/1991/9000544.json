 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Siedentop will investigate the mathematical                      physics of Coulomb systems.  The proposed work concerns (i) the                 asymptotic behavior of the ground state energy and its leading                  corrections for large molecules; (ii) the ground state density                  near the Coulomb singularities of the nuclei; and (iii) bounds on               the excess charge and ionization energy for various models of                   atomic and molecular systems.                                                        The proposed work involves developing approximate methods of               calculating various quantities associated with the atomic physics               of large atoms and molecules.  The systems in question are                      described by the Schrodinger equation, a partial differential                   equation which in the cases at hand involves many variables.  It                is thus too difficult to solve explicitly, and approximation                    techniques must be developed to understand these systems.                       Professor Siedentop's research will contribute to this important                field in an area of interest to both mathematicians and                         physicists.",
