 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project entails nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                           investigations of incommensurate systems, i.e. solids which have                perfect long range order but no lattice periodicity and are thus                intermediate between crystal lattices and disordered systems like               glasses and biological systems.  Incommensurate solids are                      characterized by at least two sublattices the periodicities of                  which can not be described as the ratio of two integers.  These                 systems exhibit a number of new phenomena not found in perfect                  crystals or disordered systems: an sliding mass density wave                    distinct from lattice vibrations in normal crystal lattices.                    Excitations of the modulation waves are known as phasons and can be             studied in a unique fashion by NMR techniques.  In addition, these              modulation waves can become pinned in a manner similar to vortex                pinning in superconductors.  The current resaerch will study                    pinning and depinning processes in a range of insulators, including             examples on incommensurate lattices in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions.  The              results of the investigations described in this proposal should be              of basic importance for the whole field of solid-state                          \"superfluidity\" in crystals, since the modulation wave in an                    incommensurate solid may be thought of a solid-state superfluid                 which may be either charged  or uncharged.",
