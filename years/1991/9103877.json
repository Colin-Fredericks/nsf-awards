 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment can strongly                  influence both the abundance and distribution of animals, as well               as the evolution of life history characteristics.  Larvae of most               benthic and demersal fishes arrive on reefs with well-developed                 swimming and sensory capabilities and therefore, have the                       potential to strongly influence the pattern of recruitment by                   controlling where and when they settle.  This research will                     experimentally examine the role of larval behavior in                           determining the pattern of settlement of a benthic fish common to               oyster reefs.  The naked goby was chosen because its larvae                     undergo a demersal schooling phase prior to settlement.  Larvae                 of this species are extremely abundant and can be easily                        observed.                                                                            Dr. Palmer and collaborators will focus on two aspects of                  larval behavior (1) how larval behavior influences pre-settlement               distribution and dispersion patterns, in turn, influence spatial                patterns of settlement.  These two processes are extremely                      important to the ultimate patterns of recruitment because they                  can determine which other species influence larval survival and                 movement, the spatial distribution of recruits, the need for                    post-settlement dispersal and the importance of density-dependent               interactions.",
