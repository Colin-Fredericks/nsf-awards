 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Narrative: This proposal will allow Dr. S.M. Raza,                    Deputy Director of the Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP) to                   participate in   collaborative research with Dr. John J. Kelley,                Brown University.  Since  1973, a geological and paleontological                field project has been operative in the Siwalik region in                       collaboration with the Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP).  Dr.                Raza has been a key participant in the project since its                        beginning.  The primary goal of the current research is to look                 for Miocene hominoids in the erosional debris deposited in the                  Siwalik Hills of Pakistan by the uplift of the Himalaya                         Mountains.  The excavation site is fossiliferous and highly                     informative about earlier states of higher primate evolution.                   Another research goal which has evolved into a large                            multidisciplinary effort is to reconstruct the physical and                     vegetational settings of past environments and thus come to an                  understanding of the evolution of South Asian mammal faunas and                 their habitats. The project will proceed simultaneously in                      fieldwork, fossil data base construction and analysis.  Dr. Raza                will be in the United States during the next two summers to carry               out his research within the project context and to prepare a                    special issue on the Siwalik for the Journal of Human Evolution.                The proposal requests funds for equipment and supplies necessary                for the proper curation and utilization of the more than 40,000                 fossil speciments collected by the Siwalik project.  Finally,                   funds are requested for the PI to visit Pakistan to install a                   computerized fossil database and for the training of the GSP                    staff.                                                                                                                                                          Scope: Apart from the mutual benefits to both institutions and to               scientific knowledge from this cooperative research, the project                will develop human resources through training and promote                       institution building not only by strengthening the institutional                links with the GSP but by funding the remaining equipment needed                to make their magnetostratigraphy laboratory a thoroughly up-to-                date facility.  This is appropriate for a country that, in terms                of its paleontological wealth, is one of the richest in the                     developing world.",
