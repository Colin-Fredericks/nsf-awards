 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Summer Mathematics Institute is a six-week residential                research summer school for about 25 minority undergraduates from                the United States and Puerto Rico.  The participants will have                  completed at least two years of collegiate mathematics with                     distinction by Summer 1991. Each student will participate in two                intensive seminars which have been designed to allow the student to             explore a mathematical subject in depth and to experience the                   excitement of creating mathematics.  A principal common to all                  seminars is helping students to develop increased fluency with                  mathematical language, both written and oral.  The overall goal of              the Institute is to help the students make the important transition             from learning mathematics to doing mathematics.                                      The Institute will be held on the Berkeley campus and                      continues and builds on successful Institutes held in 1989 and                  1990.  These Institutes are an integral part of a comprehensive                 national strategy aimed at eliminating the under-representation of              minorities in mathematics and mathematics-dependent professions.",
