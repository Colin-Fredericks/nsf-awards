 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the next three years, McLaughlin plans to find a                      category representing H4(M;Z), in a manner similar to the                       interpretation of H2(M;Z) as isomorphism classes of line bundles,               and H3(M;Z) as equivalence classes of gerbs.  He will                           investigate the consequences for string theory, elliptic                        cohomology, algebraic K-theory, knot theory, and the problem of                 defining degree three, non-abelian, sheaf cohomology.                                The basic idea is to use a smooth version of Deligne                       cohomology, and the transgression to the free loop space.  This                 will be interpreted as a generalized holonomy map.  The category                will be constructed by deducing which geometric structure has a                 given gerb as its holonomy.  McLaughlin discovered the object                   representing the first Pontrjagin class in this way.                                 This work will give a new geometric insight into Deligne                   cohomology, as the objects constructed actually lie in this more                refined theory.  There will in turn, be consequences for                        algebraic K-theory, using Beilinson's regulator.  The very                      existence of the transgression raises the possibility of a deep                 relationship between Chen's iterated integrals and Deligne                      cohomology, refining the work of Getzler, Jones and Petrack.                    McLaughlin has obtained preliminary formulae in this direction,                 which emphasize the extraordinary role played by the cup product.                    This program offers a candidate for the geometric cocycle in               elliptic cohomology.  The object in question is a \"fake\"                        infinite-dimensional vector bundle associated to a gerb.  It                    looks locally like a vector bundle but glues together in a                      different way.  This approach has the advantage of reconciling                  all the standard conjectures about elliptic cohomology and will                 be a priority in the proposed research.                                              This \"fake\" bundle can also be studied as a substitute for                 the string bundle on loop space, opening the way for a rigorous                 index theory of strings.  Finally, in the case of a three-                      manifold M, this object actually transgresses to give a new                     structure on the space of knots in M.  The implications for knot                theory will be fully investigated.                                                   The overall objective of this project is to unify several                  deep and currently disparate areas of topology.  This will be                   done by showing how analytic techniques employed in their study                 are different aspects of a common ancestor.  Applications are                   envisioned to the theory of knots and to other active areas of                  geometry and topology.",
