 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This proposal supports the collaboration of                       Dr. Louis A. Carpino, University of Massachusetts, and two                      faculty members (Drs. El-Sayed Mansour and Ahmed Kassem)                        and one graduate student (Mr. El-Faham) from the University                     of Alexandria, Egypt.  Project funding will allow the team                      from the University of Alexandria to work for various                           periods of time in Dr. Carpino's laboratory and also allow                      Dr. Carpino a research visit to the University of                               Alexandria.  Dr. Mansour, the senior member of the Egyptian                     team, will supervise research activities at the University                      of Alexandria and also spend three months at the University                     of Massachusetts conducting laboratory studies.  Dr. Kassem                     will initiate work on the synthesis of FM ethers and Mr.                        El-Faham will work on N-FM peptide bond protection.  Dr.                        Carpino, as Principal Investigator, will provide overall                        project supervision.                                                                                                                                            Scope:  This proposal brings together research scientists                       from two countries working in the area of peptide synthesis                     and coupling.  It is anticipated that this collaborative                        research will result in novel techniques for the synthesis                      of insect hormone peptide segments.  The Egyptian                               scientists will have the opportunity to become familiar                         with research techniques and equipment at the University of                     Massachusetts as well as contribute to the overall success                      of the project.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the                          objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program                       in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge                            through an international collaboration.",
