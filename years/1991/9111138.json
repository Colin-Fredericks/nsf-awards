 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a planning grant in the research application program.                   Motivated by the need of modeling complex robotic environments,                 this project will explore new methods on object                                 modeling/representation.  Current modeling systems are limited to               representing only the geometrical information of isolated                       objects, which is far less than sufficient.  To be more effective               and informative, a modeling system should also describe the                     changeable aspect of an object, i.e., the object states, the                    functionalities of an object, and the interrelations among                      objects.  It seems, thus, reasonable to propose that modeling                   should be dynamic and sensor-related.                                              The preliminary research and planning activities will focus on               surveying the ground for, and identifying problems of dynamic                   modeling, which aims to make manipulating and reasoning about                   sensory information an integrated part of modeling, taking into                 account uncertainties.  The objective is to gain sufficient                     insight about the subject in order to conduct more substantial                  research.",
