Computer aided data acquisition will be introduced               in a way that students are not \"distanced\" form the hands-on                    laboratory experience.  That is, existing laboratory equipment                  will be used to set up experiments and observe initial results;                 the computer aided data acquisition will be introduced as the                   last step to replace manual point-by-point data collection or                   copying oscilloscope traces.  This approach has several                         advantages:  students are better exposed to current engineering                 practice; data is acquired in a form suitable for analysis and                  presentation using computer tools; and laboratory efficiency is                 increased.  The choice of laptop computers and constructed data                 acquisition modules is based on the following criteria:  1) The                 data acquisition units are easily transportable - thus a few                    units may serve several laboratories.  2) Cost effectiveness,                   because few unites can serve several laboratories.  3) The small                footprint conserves bench space and 4) The capabilities of the                  constructed data acquisition modules can be matched to the                      demands of undergraduate laboratories.",
