 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of this research is to investigate the role of                   stimulus-induced intracellular potential changes in the                         coordination of plant responses to gravity.  The principal                      investigator has shown that gravistimulation induces rapid membrane             hyperpolarization along the upper side and depolarization along                 the lower side of the elongation zone of bean roots.  This                      indicates ether that cells in this region detect gravity directly               or that there is very rapid signal transmission from the putative               gravity-detecting region at the root tip.  These alternatives will              be tested by investigating electrical changes in 1) other species,              2) roots from which the caps have been removed, and 3) roots of                 mutants with impaired communication between the cap and the                     elongation zone.  These experiments will be coupled with computer-              based analysis of growth rate distribution and curvature                        development during the response in order to establish a link                    between electrical perturbations, signal transmission and growth                modifications.  These studies would improve our understanding of                the interaction of plants with their environments, and may enhance              jour ability of modify or control plant growth.  //",
