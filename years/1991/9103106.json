 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project is for support of cooperative                        research by Dr. Renato Bautista of the Department of Chemical                   and Metallurgical Engineering at the University of Nevada,                      Reno and Dr. C.K. Gupta of the Extractive Metallurgy Division                   of the Bhabha Atomic Research center (BARC) in Bombay,                          India.  The project is to characterize the application of                       cupric chloride leaching to complex nickeliferous sulfide                       ores where the nickel is mainly present in the minerals                         millerite (NiS) and pentlandite (NiFeS).  Experimental work                     will be done at BARC and mathematical modeling will be                          developed by the U. of Nevada team.  The effect of different                    parameters on the rate of leaching of the nickel sulfides                       will be examined.  The rate of dissolution of both millerite                    and pentlandite will be developed from the experimental data,                   including their rate constants and activation energies.  The                    mathematical model will cover the leaching reactions and the                    simultaneous reactions in the solution phase.  The                              information derived from the experimental work and the model                    will be applied to an indigenous nickel-copper sulfide                          concentrate.                                                                                                                                                    Scope:  the project brings together two experienced                             scientists from India and the U.S. to work on a problem that                    has significant importance to the material processing                           industry in the U.S. and India.  This collaboration meets the                   objective of the U.S.-India Cooperative Program.",
