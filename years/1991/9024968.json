 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mollusc Collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of                 Natural History contains more than 400,000 lots and 1,100 types,                and is the largest such collection in the western U. S.  These                  specimens are probably the world's best representation of the                   molluscs of the eastern Pacific.  Dr. James McLean, Curator in                  charge of the collection, has overseen its substantial growth                   during the past ten years, and he now proposes to complete                      computerization and curation of the Eastern Pacific gastropods in               the next two years.  Data entry will be completed for                           approximately 97,000 lots, and a significant private collection                 of Alaskan specimens will be integrated into the collection.                         Dr. McLean's curatorial project will have a significant                    impact on the research community.  Access to specimens in this                  important collection will be improved substantially, and                        incorporating the Alaskan material will improve the collection's                coverage of the Eastern Pacific.  Reference collections such as                 this are critical resources for research in evolution, ecology,                 biogeography, global change, and many other disciplines.  The                   continued growth and maintenance of these collections is                        essential for future generations of biological research.",
