 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding factors that control production of supercooled               liquid water in mountainous terrain is not only an important                    fundamental research question, but such knowledge is needed to                  advance techniques of enhancing winter-time orographic                          precipitation.  During the Austral winter of 1990, a joint                      experiment was held with scientists from Australia and the                      University of Nevada with most of the field costs covered by the                Australian government.  The research objectives were to measure                 mesoscale water budgets near mountainous terrain during the                     passage of extratropical cyclones and to understand how this                    budget is affected by mesoscale cloud structures.                                    Under this renewal proposal, the Principal Investigator will               continue his analysis of data collected during this experiment.                 His two research objectives are: to examine supercooled liquid                  water and precipitation development within moving mesoscale                     precipitation features and stationary orographic clouds                         associated with winter storms; and to estimate the precipitation                efficiency of mesoscale features and orographic clouds to learn                 whether they contain excess supercooled liquid water which could                be seeded for potential precipitation enhancement.",
