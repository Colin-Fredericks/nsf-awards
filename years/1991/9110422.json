 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is part of an integrated research program into                the oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea.  It is to               be carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR               scientists from February to June 1992.  The work proposed here is               an effort to define the vertical and horizontal thermohaline                    fluxes within the western part of the Weddell Gyre.                             Specifically, instrument clusters capable of measuring the                      Reynolds stress and the turbulent heat flux directly will be                    suspended from the ice at the camp and maintained throughout the                duration of the drift.  Also, a remote buoy to measure upper                    ocean temperature, salinity and current structure will be                       emplaced to make observations on the larger scale variability                   within which the turbulence data is embedded.  The measurements                 will be used in conjunction with other concurrent experiments to                quantify the energy brought to the underside of the ice and form                part of the flux of energy from the ocean through the sea ice                   cover to the atmosphere.",
