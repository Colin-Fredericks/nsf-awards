 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new type of introductory chemistry course will be developed                   to serve both as a general education course for non-science                     majors and also as a first college course for science majors                    and minors.  The philosophical basis for the course would be                    quite different from that of traditional General Chemistry.                     The emphasis of the new course would be on understanding                        synthetic processes whereby molecular-level coherences have                     emerged from less-organized antecedents, rather than on the                     analysis of substances and reactions into ever smaller                          components.  The approach is characteristic of scientists in                    the field of nonlinear dynamics, evolutionary systems and self-                 organization in far-from-equilibrium conditions.The first year                  (of three) would involve full-time course development aided in                  part by a sabbatical leave.  The second year would involve                      offering a two semester course, with laboratory, for twenty-                    five students, and continued course development.  The third                     year would involve a similar course for a larger group of                       students and also a conference to bring the philosophical basis                 of the course to a large audience of potential users.",
