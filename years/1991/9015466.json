 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the Synthetic Organic Program will support the                  research of Dr. James D. White of the Department of Chemistry at                the Oregon State University. Dr. White will focus his efforts on                six areas of synthesis of heterocyclic natural products.                                                                                                        The proposed research is directed towards the chemical synthesis                of certain, specified target structures with the objective of                   advancing the present state of knowledge of the principles of                   organic synthesis and their application in the design of routes to              complex molecules. The research is focused on the synthesis of                  heterocyclic systems that present a significant challenge to                    contemporary methodology. The specific areas towards which the                  synthetic effort will be directed include \u001a-lactams (especially                 antibiotics of the carbapenem group), alkaloids of the prianosin                family which possess significant cytotoxic activity, a                          structurally unique set of arachidonic acid metabolites related to              leukotriene, and a member of the nonadride group that exhibits                  hepatotoxic activity.",
