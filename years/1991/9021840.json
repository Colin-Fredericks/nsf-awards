 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Brown               University for the renovation and repair of the Barus and Holley                Building which houses the major portion of the materials science                research and research training activities of the Division of                    Engineering and the Department of Physics.  This building was                   constructed in 1965 and has not previously been renovated.  The                 ARFMP grant of $660,000 and $770,000 provided by the grantee as                 cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve             the current research infrastructure by correcting system and design             problems that affect safety, reliability, capacity, energy,                     maintenance, and ecology and which primarily involve the remodeling             of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and chilled             water service.  Accruing from this renovation will be the                       unrestricted use of fume hoods, the enhancement of the computing                capacity, and improvement in flexibility related to the use of                  electrical equipment.                                                                                                                                           This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                   graduate students.  Students trained in these laboratories are                  products of a large internationally-recognized center of                        excellence which has had and continues to have a major impact on                our national research effort, especially in the areas of solid                  state electronics and the mechanics of materials.",
