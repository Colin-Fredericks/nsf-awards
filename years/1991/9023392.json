 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network location problems occur when new facilities must be                located on a network such as a road network, and the network                    distances between new and existing facilities are important, due                to travel or transport between facilities.  Other networks of                   interest include air corridor or sea corridor networks, river                   networks, or electrical networks.  Such problems occur on a large               scale in urban, regional. or geographic contexts, where there may               be literally hundreds of thousands (or more) of existing                        facilities, in which case it is common to aggregate existing                    facilities, e.g., represent all the existing facility locations                 within a zip code area by a single location.  This aggregation                  makes the size of the problem more manageable for data collection               and data processing purposes, as well as for purposes of analysis.              At the same time, this aggregation introduces errors, and results               in an approximating problem being solved instead of the actual                  problem of interest.  Currently there is very little theory for                 doing aggregation, or for evaluating the results of aggregation.                Most approaches are based on experimentation or computational                   studies.  This is a project to develop theory to improve the means              available for doing aggregation.                                                     The project has the potential to enhance greatly the ability               to solve important facility planning problems that occur                        increasingly in our complex society.//",
