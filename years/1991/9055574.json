 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a new model of              instruction and assessment that fosters the construction of scientific          meaning in students and that encourages conceptual development                  consistent with the growth of scientific knowledge.  We propose the             development of a Portfolio Culture in science classrooms.  the                  implementation of a portfolio culture represents a fundamental change in        teaching priorities, classroom practices, and institutional functions.          This project is directed at evaluating and documenting how the adoption         of a portfolio culture affects student performance as well as how               teacher attitudes and practice are affected.  This research will have           several outcomes:  setting classroom instructional guidelines that              inform teachers about the selection and sequences of instructional              tasks; generating strategies to conduct formative assessment of                 students' knowledge bases; providing recommendations for in-service             education programs that strive to implement conceptual change teaching          reforms; and exploring ways that alternative assessment strategies can          be used by other educational constituents to communicate learning               outcomes.  Educational Testing Service is contributing substantial              financial and staff resources to support initial phases of this work.           Pittsburgh Public Schools is willing to contribute costs associated with        participation by teachers and administrators.",
