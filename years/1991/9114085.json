 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microglia, a specialized type of glia, is related in function and               origin to macrophages.  While the functional role and properties                of brain microglial cells have been debated for some time, recent               evidence supports that these cells are tissue resident                          macrophages.  Ramified microglia, a specialized form of                         microglia, noted for its branching characteristics, appears to be               derived from and capable of conversion into active macrophages,                 however, these cells are inactive in respect to macrophage                      activity.  Because of its inactive status, it has been generally                thought that ramified microglia contribute little to the normal                 operation of brain tissue and serve only as precursors of active                macrophages.  Previous studies of ramified microglia in tissue                  culture revealed a combination of motility and pinocytosis, fluid               uptake and removal activity.  The goal of this research project                 is to determine the function of ramified microglial.  Dr. Thomas                will ascertain whether these cells continually take up and                      exchange fluid for the purpose of removing or degrading small                   soluble compounds.  Experiments utilizing radioactive gamma-                    aminobutyric acid (3H-GABA) will be performed to determine the                  kinetic properties of fluid uptake in isolated microglial cells                 in culture.  The kinetic properties will be used to delineate the               fluid-phase from the absorptive phase of pinocytosis.  In                       addition, the degradation of pinocytosed compounds will be                      assessed.  Results derived from this investigation will provide                 information on whether ramified microglia functions as a                        filtering system to cleanse CNS extracellular fluid.",
