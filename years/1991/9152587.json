 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Argon ion laser, optical table and laser accessories are                     being used as part of an ongoing effort to create instructional                 labs for three newly developed courses in the area of Lasers                    and Modern Optics, and improve two recently initiated major                     student projects: construction of a photoacoustic microscope                    and a diffusion measurement apparatus. A significant ingredient                 of the project is the use of materials of high technological                    importance, such as liquid crystals, polymer dispersed liquid                   crystals, micellar systems, and colloidal particles, which                      provide new ways of performing laboratory experiments, and                      exposure to novel materials and their applications.  The                        acquired equipment is being used to achieve the following                       goals: a. create new experiments in the area of modern optics,                  b. significantly improve instruction on lasers and their                        applications, c. provide unique laboratory experiments and ways                 of introducing nonlinear optics to the undergraduate                            curriculum, and d. strengthen student research in an                            undergraduate environment.  The versatility of the requested                    equipment assures its continued impact on future instructional                  and student research activities.NSF grant funds are being                       matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
