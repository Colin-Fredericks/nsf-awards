 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, photodissociation of isolated and                    solvated molecular iodine and organic iodides will be studied,                  and the dynamics will be analyzed in three sets of experiments.                 The first set will involve the development of a one-dimensional                 projection technique to determine the velocity distribution of                  the iodine fragment from the dissociation processes.  The                       second set will involve femtosecond pump-probe techniques to                    measure the kinetic energy of the photofragments as a function                  of excess energy above the dissociation limit to gain                           information on the shape of the dissociating potential energy                   surface.  The third set will involve the study of solvated                      iodine ions which are photodissociated and examined using                       mass-selected ion kinetic energy spectroscopy, from which the                   fragmentation dynamics are deduced.                                             %%%                                                                             The study of photodissociation processes of polyatomic                          molecules, that is, the fragmentation of molecules with many                    atoms using light, can reveal a great deal about the electronic                 forces which shape the behavior of the molecules.  In                           particular, the lifetimes of the molecules in an excited                        electronic energy state as well as the partitioning of the                      excess energy among the fragments when an electronically                        excited molecule decomposes can be determined.  This                            information in turn can give a detailed picture of the                          potential energies which govern the behavior of dissociating                    fragments, which in turn can be related to the behavior of the                  species in condensed (liquid or solid) phases.  Such                            experimental spectroscopic studies of the photodissociation of                  polyatomic molecules are the goal of the current project.",
