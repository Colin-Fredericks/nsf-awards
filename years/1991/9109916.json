 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies dynamic general equilibrium models with                    distortions.  There are two main areas of concern.  The first of                these deals with the theoretical properties of price taking models              with distortions in general (that is, existence, uniqueness, etc.).             This is basic research studying the internal consistency of the                 Walrasian view of economics in environments in which government                 policy plays an important role.                                                                                                                                 The second area is the more specialized area of the determinants                of growth.  The emphasis here is on the types of and quantitative               nature of the effects of government policies on development.  Three             distinct projects will be investigated.  The first concerns the                 form of optimal (Ramsey) taxation in models of endogenous growth                and involves the estimation of the productive role played by                    government expenditures (for example, schooling).  This will be                 accomplished through the analysis of the steady state equations                 from a completely specified general equilibrium model.  The second              project concerns the effect of monetary policy and inflation on the             rate of growth or development of an economy.  This has been                     identified as a quantitatively important policy variable in the                 empirical literature on the determinants of growth.  The last                   project studies the alterations which arise in the theory of                    endogenous growth under conditions of uncertainty.  Very little                 work has been done in this area to this point.  An example                      identified as important in the empirical literature is the                      depressing effect on growth of an increase in the variance of the               monetary expansion rule.                                                                                                                                        The last few years have seen a virtual explosion of work on models              of endogenous growth.  This is because of the importance of these               models in helping our understanding of the process of growth and                development.  A full development of both empirical and theoretical              research in this area will bring us to a deeper understanding of                both the successes (for example, Japan and Korea) of the last 40                years as well as the failures (for example, Chad).  Taken as a                  whole, the research will make a serious contribution to this                    effort.  In particular, the work on inflation and growth and growth             and uncertainty will be of particular use since these factors have              already been identified as important explanatory variables in the               empirical literature.",
