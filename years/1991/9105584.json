It's two-fold mission is (1) to identify the scientific                         and technology needs of the U.S. semiconductor                                  industry and to develop and implement a long-                                   range strategy for meeting these needs; and (2) to                              enhance the skilled manpower base of the industry.                              These goals ar realized through an integrated                                   program of basic research conducted by faculty and                              graduate students at leading U.S. universities.                                 Since 1982, the SRC has committed more than $150                                million to this mission and now supports more than                              one-half of all the silicon-related generic research                            being carried out at U.S. universities.                                         The intent of this grant is to establish a new, three-                          year Memorandum of Understanding between the                                    SRC and the United States Government, as                                        represented by the National Science Foundation,                                 which will provide the framework for continued                                  Government participation.",
