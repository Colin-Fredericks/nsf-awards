 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computer of tomorrow will be a fault tolerant network in                 which communication is a fully integrated function equal in                     significance to storage and processing.  In such a network,                     challenging problems arise from the need to maintain consistency                of the data and of processing.  These problems are currently solved             using agreement protocols that require many message frames to be                exchanged with adverse effects on network performance.  The                     approach of this research to maintaining consistency is based on                two novel protocols.  The Trans protocol provides efficient                     reliable broadcast or multicast communication.  The Total protocol              promptly places a total order on message frames and achieves                    distributed agreement in the presence of communication faults and               of fail-stop, timing, omission, and Byzantine processor faults.                 The Trans and Total protocols are intended to be used in local area             networks such as Ethernet, token ring or FDDI ring.  By exploiting              the inherent broadcast characteristics of the physical                          communication medium, substantial improvements in performance can               be achieved.  The design of fault-tolerant networks is greatly                  simplified when consistency between distributed components of the               network is maintained by the communication function.",
