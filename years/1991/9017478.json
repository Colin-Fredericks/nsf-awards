 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides two-thirds of the funding for acquiring                a computerized control and analysis system for specialized                      microscopy of rock deformation experiments. The equipment is to be              installed and used in the Department of Geological Sciences at the              State University of New York in Albany. The SUNY system is                      committed to providing the remaining one-third funding for the                  acquisition of the equipment.                                                        Rocks and minerals subjected to mechanical stress and chemical             changes deform very slowly over geologically significant periods                of time. Much insight on the processes of recrystallization,                    diffusive transfer of material, phase transformations and other                 processes that influence the mechanical-chemical behavior and the               microstructure of deformed rocks can be harvested from studying,                under the microscope, the deformation of synthetic analogs during               much shorter time scales. The acquisition of this equipment will                allow one of the leading research groups performing this type of                research to automate the control, recording, and analysis of the                microstructural evolution of rock deformation.",
