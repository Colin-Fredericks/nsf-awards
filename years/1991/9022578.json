 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves automating toolpath generation using                     techniques from expert systems and computer geometry.  The goal is              to generate CNC codes directly from abstract geometric models.                  Expert systems will be used in conjunction with spline-based                    geometric models.  The geometric models will model \"standard\"                   geometries while the expert systems will model \"features\" common to             manufactured goods,( e.g., counterbored holes).  These models will              then generate CNC codes that can be run on a numerically controlled             machine center.  The goal of this research is to develop a fully                automated rapid prototyping capability for manufacturing systems.                                                                                               An advantage that European and Japanese manufacturers have over the             United States is the ability to rapidly modify products to meet new             user demands.  This research is an effort to improve the rapid                  prototyping of manufacturing goods.  The research also will lead to             improved quality control procedures and batch manufacturing                     capabilities.  The research request is for the acquisition of a                 device for manufacturing goods.  The machine center will be driven              by numeric codes automatically generated from a combination of a                mathematical representation and an expert system representation of              the object to be manufactured.  This capability will be unique in               U. S. universities.",
