 "awd_abstract_narration": "Divided government occurs when  different political parties control             the executive and legislative branches of government.  Once a rare              occurrence in American politics divided government has become                   increasingly commonplace.  As a consequence, the subject of divided             government has attracted increasing scientific attention not least              because the growth of divided government is variously blamed for                budget deficits, policy paralysis, and increasing partisan conflict             in government.  To date most scholarly attention has focussed on                divided government at the national level of American politics.                  However, the evidence is that the incidence of divided government               has increased just as rapidly in the American states and with                   similar consequences.  This innovative project undertakes to                    examine the nature and determinants of divided government in the                American states.                                                                                                                                                In addition to the intrinsic importance of American state                       government, there are sound scientific reasons for examining                    divided government at the state level.  Although a number of                    explanations have been advanced to explain the growth of divided                government, the national focus of previous research has precluded               rigorous analysis since these studies have been limited to a single             case.  By focussing on divided government in the American states,               this project will take advantage of the substantial variance in                 divided government at the state level to refine and test competing              hypotheses.  Of particular interest is the hypothesis that divided              government is a consequence in large measure of the growing                     professionalism of state legislatures which has tended increasingly             to shelter legislators -- especially members of the Democratic                  party -- from competitive electoral pressures.  If                              substantiated, this explanation has important implications for the              current debate about legislative term limitation.                                                                                                               When completed this project should provide much richer and more                 rigorous explanations of both the causes and consequence of divided             government.",
