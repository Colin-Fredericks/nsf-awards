 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research (with Harmel 9112491) investigates the              dynamics of political party change.  It examines the mechanisms                 that produce changes in goals, issue positions, activities, and                 organization of parties.  Time-series data will be collected on 19              political parties in four countries for the period 1950-1990.                   These data will be used both to assess the nature and extent of                 party change and to explain those changes in terms of environmental             changes, the parties' performance in elections and in government,               and leadership decisions.                                                                                                                                       Although focused on individual parties, this research also will be              important for understanding change in party systems.  An                        understanding of individual parties is necessary to understand                  changes in larger systems.  Moreover, both types of change are                  central theoretically to understanding the dynamic of government.                                                                                               When completed this data intensive research will increase our                   understanding of the dynamics of political party change. Moreover,              the data collected will be of lasting value to other scholars                   interested in political parties.",
