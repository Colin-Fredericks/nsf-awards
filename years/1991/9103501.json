 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of the research and public policy attention on urban poverty          is directed at the \"urban underclass.\"  In addition to unemployed,              minority, inner-city females heading their own families, the urban              underclass also includes many women who work for wages.  These women are        employed in dead-end, female-dominated occupations and are no more              financially secure than they would be if they received welfare payments.        This doctoral dissertation project will explore the strategies that low-        income women have developed to ensure the health, safety, and shelter of        themselves and their families without relying on welfare.  Specifically,        the research will focus on the place-specific nature of the personal            contacts that link African-American, Puerto Rican, and Vietnamese women         to jobs, child care, and housing.  Intensive personal interviews and a          survey questionnaire will be used to investigate the ways that personal         networks enable and constrain women in their quests to provide for              themselves and their families.  Analysis of the spatial dimensions of           women's social networks will illuminate the relationship between the            nature of these networks and the job, housing, and child-care                   opportunities available to these women.                                                                                                                              By focusing explicitly on the spatial dimensions and the place-            based nature of personal contacts, this project will provide valuable           information about the degree to which women are constrained                     locationally, and it will assess the impacts of these spatial                   constraints on their economic survival.  This project also will provide         an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to           develop independent research skills.",
