 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a sabbatical visit by                   Professor Michael E. Moody of Washington State University to                    the University of Vienna, Austria, to collaborate with Professor                Reinhard Buerger of the Institute of Mathematics and other                      experts in mathematical genetics.  They share an interest in                    the mathematical approaches to examining fundamental problems                   in population genetics.  They will develop mathematical models                  to examine more precisely the population genetics implicit in                   a qualitative theory concerning the mechanism of one type of                    speciation.  Specifically, they propose to test the theory that                 symbiont-induced speciation could result from differential                      coadaptation between habitats along an environmental gradient.                  Such a gradient could give rise to alternative outcomes of the                  coevolutionary interaction.  Professor Moody has considerable                   experience modeling population genetics problems such as                        coevolution and population structure through analysis of gene                   flow at a single locus in geographically structured populations.                The University of Vienna has several faculty possessing a                       variety of complementary expertise in mathematical genetics,                    including multi-locus models.                                                                                                                                   The most striking aspect of biological evolution is the                         radiation of species into the vast array of forms observed in                   every corner of the earth.  Understanding species evolution was                 the goal of Darwin's original theory, and, to this day,                         elucidating the mechanisms of speciation remains the central                    challenge of evolutionary biology.  One of several conjectures                  is that coevolution between species may contribute directly to                  speciation; the interaction between symbionts and their hosts is                one likely mechanism.  However, the genetic and ecological                      conditions under which symbiont-induced speciation will occur are               poorly understood.  The proposed collaborative research should                  provide theoretical insights into the genetic consequences of                   symbiont-induced speciation and therefore contribute toward                     improved understanding of evolutionary divergence.",
