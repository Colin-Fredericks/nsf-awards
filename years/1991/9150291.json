 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project performs pilot studies to facilitate laboratory-                   based learning of concurrent engineering concepts.  The learn-                  by-doing laboratory approach to teach concurrent engineering is                 made possible by rapid prototyping technologies, in which a                     product design on a CAD system is transformed to its physical                   counterpart using either stereo lithography appratus, selective                 laser sintering or 3-D printing. This project develops a                        comprehensive architecture for laboratory development,                          including equipment specifications, experiments, and curricular                 recommendations which serve as a national model for adoption at                 other universities.  The project develops laboratory                            experiments and case studies to teach concurrent engineering                    concepts with respect to manufacturability,                                     serviceability/maintainability, testability, quality and                        reliability during the product design process.",
