 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past decade there has been growing recognition of the                desire of some Native Americans and other ethnic groups that the                remains of their ancestors should not be housed in museums.  They               believe that these remains should be returned for reburial or                   reconsecration according to their traditional practices.  As a                  result it is clear that significant portions of the nation's                    collections of human skeletal remains may have to be returned                   within the forthcoming few years.  Although there is disagreement               among anthropologists as to whether or to remains should be                     repatriated upon request, there is agreement that if repatriated,               all remains should be fully documented and recorded first.  The                 question is, what should be recorded?                                                                                                                           This is to provide funds for a conference of experts to                         established a set of universal guidelines for recording                         information about skeletal remains scheduled for repatriation.                  Without such recordation the information that may be gained by                  studying the remains would be lost forever.  The conference will                be hosted by the Field Museum of Natural HIstory which will                     organize the conference, provide the meeting space, and oversee                 the results.",
