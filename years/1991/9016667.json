 "awd_abstract_narration": "The unusual polymerization behavior of microtubules known as                    dynamic instability is thought to play an important role in                     morphogenesis.  The means by which this behavior is regulated in                vivo is very poorly understood.  Experiments are proposed to look               at global regulation of microtubule stability in cells, and in                  particular to look at the effect of partial ATP depletion and                   microinjection of specific kinases and phosphatases.  Additional                proteins that show phosphorylation-dependent or ATP-dependent                   binding to microtubules in vitro will be sought, and the                        relationship of microtubule stability as measured by nocodazole                 sensitivity (the basis for almost all previous analyses), and                   stability, as measured by the incorporation of biotin-labelled                  tubulin, will be explored.  Further studies are planned to                      determine whether stable microtubules in vivo are capped at their               ends or inhibited from depolymerization by binding of proteins                  along the length of the polymer.  The detailed mechanisms by which              microtubule associated proteins and microtubule motor proteins                  contribute to microtubule stability will be explored by                         transfection and biotin-tubulin injection.  In these experiments                a study of the structure of specific microtubule-associated                     proteins will be combined with in vivo studies of physiological                 regulation of microtubules in the hope of understanding how the                 morphogenesis of microtubule arrays is generated.                                                                                                               \"Microtubules\" are sub-microscopic structures, small tubes, within              cells that serve as a component of the internal \"skeleton\" that                 determines a cell's shape.  Microtubules also serve as tracks,                  along which other sub-cellular structures move.  Microtubules are               unstable structures that polymerize or depolymerize in response to              changing physiological conditions within the cell.  This US-USSR                cooperative research involves two of the world's leading                        experts on microtubule structure and function in a study of the                 mechanisms that control microtubule stability.  The results of this             collaborative research should provide important new information                 concerning the biochemical factors that determine where, within                 cells, microtubules form, how many form, and what determines their              length.  This knowledge will be an important contribution to our                fundamental understanding of how cells function.",
