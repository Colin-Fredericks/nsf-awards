 "awd_abstract_narration": "Processes which limit or modify population abundance are of                     general interest to ecologists.  In marine systems, two                         alternative hypotheses are currently the focus of attention.  The               recruitment limitation hypothesis suggests that recruitment form                the larval phase sets the upper limit in population size, or the                variation in recruitment is subsequently reflected as variation                 in population abundance.  Another view suggests that post-                      recruitment processes, particularly competition for space or                    food, predation or migration are most important in limiting or                  regulating sizes of demersal populations.  Dr. Sale and                         collaborators suggest a more pluralistic approach is required to                adequately explain variability in population structure.  They                   will examine this by testing the relative importance of pre- and                post-recruitment processes to a Gulf of Maine fish population at                different spatial scales and in different habitats.                             Specifically they will examine:                                                                                                                                      1) the importance of larval supply, settlement and post-                        settlement mortality to recruitment variability at a range                      of spatial scales and in different habitats                                                                                                                     2) the importance of recruitment and post-recruitment                           processes to the limitation or determination of population                      size in different habitats                                                                                                                                 This approach will simultaneously be investigating both pre- and                post-recruitment processes at different spatial scales and in                   very different habitats.  Additionally, this research will allow                for comparison of the factors affecting fish populations between                temperate and tropical latitudes.",
