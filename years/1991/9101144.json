 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Nanofabrication Facility (NNF) at Cornell University               is an interdisciplinary center, whose primary role is to provide                resources and technical expertise to researchers in                             microstructure science, particularly in the areas of advanced                   lithographies, nanostructure physics, scanning tunneling                        microscopy for fabrication and analysis, optoelectronic and                     electronic applications, microfabrication applications to                       biology, and related areas.  NNF provides equipment, training ,                 and expertise to leading edge research in a \"hands-on\"                          environment where the user is responsible for the conduct of that               research.  NNF has a program of discrete projects under the                     supervision of academic mentors at Cornell whose research is                    associated with the Facility.  The proposed period of performance               takes particular advantage of ongoing NNF educational activities                as well as interaction with other REU programs campus-wide.                     Ongoing NNF educational activities include general laboratory                   orientation; wet chemical safety orientation; and \"NanoCourses\".                Several events are planned to encourage interaction with other                  REU Students on campus, and some NNF participants will work in                  teams or in collaboration with students in other programs.  All                 students are required to present their project results at a                     concluding all-campus Forum and to prepare a final report.  NNF                 again is targeting women and minority undergraduates, and schools               with small-to-medium-sized programs presumed to have limited                    laboratory facilities.  The program goals are for a total of 12                 participants, at least 9 of whom are not regularly enrolled at                  Cornell, and 6 are women or underrepresented minorities.",
