 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the effects of a severe arctic storm                  on community structure and evolution of the mussel, \u001aMytilus                    califonianus\u001a. The storm descended on the Pacific Northwest in                  late December 1990 and resulted in atypical freezing weather in                 the intertidal zone inhabited by the mussels. Such events                       probably occur about once in every twenty five years although                   there is some evidence of an increase. The mussels were severely                affected by the freeze, and large mortalities were observed.                    However, mortality appears to be non.random. Mussels with other                 organisms living on and with them, such as barnacles and algae,                 did not die as often as mussels without associated organisms.                   This project will document mortality through field collections,                 and carry out genetic analysis (by the technique of                             electrophoresis) of survivors and of dead individuals. The                      results will determine whether genetic and phenotypic changes in                the mussel populations will accompany community wide changes, and               hence whether evolutionary changes will occur.",
