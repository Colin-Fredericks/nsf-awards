 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop addresses the development of the computer                    science curriculum by inviting leading researchers with a track                 record in teaching and research to describe the content and                     structure of courses that have worked well in practice in                       specific areas such as the following: Introductory courses,                     Computer Literacy courses, Mathematics for Computer Science,                    Programming Languages, Programming Methodology, Architecture,                   Software Engineering, Computer Systems, Databases, Theory of                    Computation, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence. One of                    the goals of this workshop is to produce a source book and a                    critical review of some of the best courses and materials                       available for undergraduate computer science education.                              It is widely recognized that the computer science                          curriculum needs to be reformed.  This workshop is significant                  because it covers a broad range of courses from well-respected                  institutions and it will actually produce a sourcebook.",
