 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to investigate the temperatures, pre-eruptive                   volatile contents, compositions, and ages of three high-                        temperature rhyolites that had contrasting eruptive styles.  The                units are a moderately-welded ash flow sequence overlain by a                   spatter-fed rhyolitic flow complex, which in turn is overlain by                a voluminous (15 km3) effusive rhyolite lava flow.  Because these               units apparently erupted over a short period of time and show                   very different styles of eruptive activity, they provide and                    excellent opportunity to learn not only about the pre-eruptive                  volatile content of \"anhydrous\" high-temperature rhyolites, but                 also to explore the control of volatile content, temperature, and               crystallinity on style of eruption.  The ion microprobe will be                 used to analyze melt inclusions for volatile and lithophile trace               elements and to investigate trace element zoning in host                        pheoncrysts.  Bulk analyses of selected pumice and scoria lumps                 and of vitrophyric lava will provide information on the                         geochemistry of the magmatic system.  Detailed field work will                  supply information on volumes of the units and key samples for                  radiometric age determinations.  Among other things the study                   should place constraints on the petrogenesis of these rhyolites,                determine whether the eruptive style relates to temperature as                  recorded by phenocrysts, and increase understanding of volatile                 composition prior to eruption.",
