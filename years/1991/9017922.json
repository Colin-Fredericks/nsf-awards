 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will continue analysis of fold development in                   single layers by use of computer modelling and by the study of                  natural folds.  The aim is to better understand folding processes               in non-linear materials, in layers oriented oblique to the                      principal bulk strain directions, and in layers that undergo non-               coaxial strain.  Finite element models will be used to study                    variations in shape and strain distribution in symmetrical folds                as functions of viscosity contrast, power-law exponent, initial                 shape, and initial wavelength of the layers.  A comparison will be              made between the development of symmetrical folds & that of                     asymmetrical folds that develop either in simple shear or in                    oblique layers subjected to pure shear.  Criteria will be                       developed, based on fold shape and strain, that will give                       information on bulk deformation paths in rocks.  Natural folds will             be studied for arc length vs. thickness distribution, fold shape,               and strain pattern.  These data from natural folds will be compared             with the experimental data in order to gain insight on their                    rheology during deformation.  The results of this study will                    greatly improve our understanding of rock behavior during tectonic              folding.",
