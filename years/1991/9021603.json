 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate:  a) the attributions people draw                about others based on the emotions those others express, b) how                 people's behavior toward others is influenced by the emotions                   those others express, and c) whether and, if so, when, people                   will choose to intentionally strategically present emotions to                  others.  Three emotions will be investigated:  happiness, sadness               and anger.  A person's happiness is expected to increase                        attributions of likableness to that person and to increase                      compliance with the person.  Happiness is expected to be                        strategically presented to others as an ingratiation strategy                   when the potential presenter has reason for the other to like him               or her and/or a desire for the other to comply with him or her.                 A person's sadness is expected to increase neediness attributions               of dependency or neediness to that person and to increase the                   amount of help that that person will receive (assuming the other                feels some moral obligation to help).  Sadness is expected to be                strategically presented to others as a supplication strategy when               the presented desires help.  This may be a more effective                       strategy in communal relationships (in which obligation to help                 is high) than in exchange relationships (in which obligation to                 help is lower).  Finally, a person's anger is expected to                       increase attributions of dangerousness to that person and to                    increase the amount of others' compliance with that person's                    desires.  This may be particularly  true when the potential                     complier has low power relative to the angry person and when                    their relationship is a non-voluntary one.  Anger is expected to                be strategically presented to others as an intimidation strategy                when the presenter wants the other to comply, has power over the                other and when the relationship is non-voluntary.                                                                                                               This research will inform our understanding of strategic self-                  presentation, as well as increase the body of knowledge related                 to communal and exchange relationships.",
