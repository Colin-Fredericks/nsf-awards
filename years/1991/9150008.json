 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigators will conduct an R and D                        project that will translate past laboratory studies into                        practically relevant instruction.  Their goals are: (1) to                      develop theoretically based, but practically useful methods                     and materials for teaching effective problem solving in the                     prototype domain of basic physics; (2) to increase                              understanding of the cognitive processes needed to learn                        such problem solving; and (3) thus to develop research-based                    guidelines for designing problem-solving instruction in                         other quantitative sciences.  The effort will use                               interactive instructional methods to teach explicitly a                         general problem-solving strategy, a well-organized knowledge                    base, and the decision and checking processes needed to                         apply the strategy.  The instructional methods, materials,                      and underlying theoretical models will be cumulatively                          improved by a sequence of instructional experiments,                            extending from small-scale studies to classroom contexts.                       In these the students will be observed in detail, the data                      analyzed (partially by computer modeling) to elucidate                          underlying learning difficulties, and the results                               systematically used to revise the instructional approach.                       Prototype instructional materials will be produced and made                     available to teachers and other researchers.",
