 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Phillip L. Gould and a graduate                   student at Washington University, St. Louis, to collaborate in                  civil engineering research with Professor Gerhart I. Schueller of               the Institute of Mechanics, University of Innsbruck, Austria.                   They share an interest in the response of structures to the                     strong ground motions of earthquakes.  Professor Gould is                       currently supported by the Earthquake Engineering Section of NSF                for a study of the interaction effects on pile-supported structures             subject to severe ground motion during the Loma Prieta earthquake               of 1989.  One particular structure near San Francisco is the main               focus of that study.  Through collaboration with Professor                      Schueller and his colleagues, it will be possible to introduce                  probabilistic and simulation techniques to extend this research                 and generalize the results.  This will significantly increase the               interpretation and application of the anticipated results of the                ongoing study.                                                                                                                                                  The structure under study by Professor Gould and colleagues is                  located in a region that sustained locally heavy damage during                  the 1989 earthquake; however, it survived with only minor                       cracking.  It is suspected that the flexible pile foundation                    interacting with the surrounding soft soil played a major role in               this outcome.  The contribution of the Austrian investigators,                  who are expert in statistical methods, will enable the results to               be applied to the effects of other earthquakes which may take                   place at many places in the world.  This generalization would                   facilitate the design of structures to take advantage of the                    energy dissipation provided by soil-pile-structure interaction,                 and thereby improve the survivability of the structure and the                  safety of the occupants.",
