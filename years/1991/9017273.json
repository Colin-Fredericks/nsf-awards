 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main focus of this project in the Analytical and Surface                    Chemistry Program is the utilization of the electrochemical                     properties of clay modified electrodes to study the transport                   of species that should mimic the movement of organic pollutants                 through a clay bed. Models for the kinetic process of ion                       exchange (adsorption) followed by partitioning reactions in a                   porous medium will be developed for multisweep cyclic                           voltammetry. These will be fast quasi-explicit finite                           difference models, and will be tested experimentally at a                       clay-modified electrode with a variety of compounds which                       should fall into different kinetic regions. The model will be                   used to predict the effect of electrolyte speciation in                         maximizing retention of an organic compound diffusing through a                 clay bed. The role of porosity in controlling the reaction will                 be monitored in situ by an electroactive probe whose current                    will be controlled purely by diffusion, which is, in turn,                      controlled by the porosity of the medium. A model has been                      developed which relates the porosity of a well-oriented film to                 the interlayer spacing.                                                                                                                                         The results are expected to provide an improved understanding                   of several important processes which occur in the clays which                   are used to line chemical waste disposal sites.  Among these                    are the adsorption and absorption of chemicals by clays and the                 shrinking and swelling of clays as solvents and electrolytes                    are absorbed.  It is also possible that the project will lead                   to the development of a rapid electrochemical method for                        measuring the porosity of clays.",
