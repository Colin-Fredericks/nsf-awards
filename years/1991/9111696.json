A special effort is made to                  include the work of graduate students and assistant professors                  representing a broad range of specialties, but with increasing                  emphasis on twentieth century problems.  The scientific results of              the cliometric history movement have been impressive and promise                to be equally important in the years ahead.  The next meetings are              scheduled to be held in May 1992 and May 1993 at  Miami University              and the University of Illinois, respectively.",
