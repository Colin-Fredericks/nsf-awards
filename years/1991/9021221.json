 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will test the cognitive, autonomic, and emotional                 processes that foster malfunctioning caregiving systems.  Past                  research has demonstrated that women with low perceived control                 as caregivers are more likely to show autonomic arousal and                     emotionally negative reactions when attempting to cope with                     \"difficult\" children.  In reciprocal fashion, children within                   such systems are likely to show response patterns that maintain                 the beliefs of caregivers.  For example, they may show self-                    protective avoidance behaviors that are readily (mis)interpreted                by caregivers as showing defiance.  Research proposed here                      extends this line of inquiry in two directions:                                   Do low power (caregiving) beliefs act as automatically-accessed               \"scripts\"?  The prediction is tested that women with low                        perceived control as caregivers readily bring to mind \"threat-                  oriented\" ideation, i.e., they easily interpret child behavior as               challenging their fragile sense of their own control.                             Do the beliefs of children about social interactions influence                their perception and response to the expressive behaviors of                    others?  The prediction is tested that children with low                        perceived control in their social environment are likely to                     manifest autonomic arousal, poor emotion regulation, and                        inaccurate processing of ongoing events when the expressive cues                of others suggests the presence of \"threat.\"  Responses of                      children (aged 5 to 10) are measured in reaction to a video that                includes cues to potential threat (child having routine medical                 exam).  Children with low perceived control are expected to be                  hypervigilant to subtle cues to \"threat\" (e.g., a worried                       expression shown by the videotaped child); they are also expected               to show deterioration in their perception of and response to                    witnessed events.  In a second study, the effects of socially                   empowering experiences will be tested to determine the extent to                which they buffer against dysfunctional responses to \"threat.\"                    Implications are for feedback loops that foster and maintain                  dysfunctional information-processing patterns and family systems.               This research will provide information on controlling mechanisms                within such systems, as well as the extent to which such                        mechanisms are subject to change as a function of altered                       experience.***                                                                   //",
