 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molybdenum silicide (MoSi2) based monolithic and composite                      materials have potential aircraft applications in the temperature               range 1000-1600oC.  MoSi2 based intermetallics have proven to be                rather formidable materials to process because of its extreme                   brittleness.  In order to successfully process and fabricate                    components based on MoSi2, it is necessary to enhance its low                   temperature ductility and toughness.  This research focusses on                 preparation of fine grained MoSi2 via advanced rapid                            solidification and powder metallurgical processing to improve its               low temperature ductility and toughness.  The fine grain size                   will reduce the slip length, therefore, lower the stress                        concentration at the grain boundaries and thus enhance ductility.               Phase I research will also investigate the effect of TiB2 and HfC               dispersoids on grain refinement.  It is expected that these                     stable dispersoids will retain the fine microstructure as well as               voids around these incoherent particles, especially at high                     temperatures.  Phase II research will investigate in more detail                the dispersoid/grain boundary and dispersoid/dislocation                        interactions to define the processing-microstructure-mechanical                 property relationships so that optimum mechanical properties                    will be attained at both room and elevated temperatures.",
