Zakharov of the Landau Institute of                          Theoretical Physics, Moscow, will provide an opportunity                        for US and Soviet scientists to discuss Mathematical                            Aspects of Integrable Nonlinear Equations, Inverse                              Problems in Physics, Nonlinear Optics, Turbulence,                              Plasmas and Collapse, Ionospheric Plasmas, Atmospheres                          and Oceans.  It will be held in Potsdam, NY August 1-11,                        1991.                                                                                                                                                           This meeting differs from previous meetings in this                             series in its emphasis on applications.  Most of the                            sections will be devoted to the application of                                  integrability, dynamical systems, and chaos to physical                         systems.  The intent is to bring together both scientists                       working in theory as well as applications to further                            enhance the applicability of various nonlinear models.                                                                                                          This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the U.S. and U.S.S.R. to combine complementary efforts                          and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and                         competence in the field of basic scientific research on                         the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of                            benefit.",
