 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1991 Northeast Regional Conference on Developmental biology                 will be held at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA                on the weekend of April 19-21. This proposal requests funds to                  support graduate student attendance and participation at the                    meeting. As a general goal, the Conference is organized with the                intent of bringing together a broad range of developmental                      biologists, at various stages of their careers, to present and                  discuss their research in formal and informal settings. further,                we will continue to integrate research in both plant and animal                 developmental biology in an effort to enhance the communication                 between groups that have traditionally been separated. The                      Conference will include four formal platform sessions, two poster               presentation sessions, and a keynote address; a format that                     proved quite successful at last year's meeting. Additionally, the               Conference will have a video microscopy session and an informal                 workshop on the use of Polymerase Chain Reaction technology.                    There will also be ample time for informal discussions.                         Consequently, the revised format at this year's meeting will                    afford ample opportunity for young investigators to present their               research to an interested audience.",
