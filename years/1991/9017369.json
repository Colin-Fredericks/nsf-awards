This                                                                                                      research deals with response to multiple natural hazards                        in Puerto Rico following the experience of homeowners with                                                                                                      Hurricane Hugo in 1989.  The research will focus on the                         impacts of direct or indirect experience with hurricane                         damage on the adoption of subsequent mitigation measures.                                                                                                       It involves a survey of a geographically stratified sample                                                                                                      of homeowners, and the spatial and statistical analysis of                                                                                                      responses using a geographic information system.  We will                       be able to test for the impact of geographic location of                        the household as well as family connections with                                households in areas that suffered damage on attitudes                           towards risk and the purchase of flood insurance, as well                       as earthquake insurance beyond that mandated by lenders.                        We will explore the relationship of the perception of                           hurricane risk with perceptions and preparedness for the                        other major natural hazard facing Puerto Rico -                                 earthquakes.",
