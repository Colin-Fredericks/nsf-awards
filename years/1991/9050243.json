 "awd_abstract_narration": "First Light is a one-hour documentary to be shown                          nationally on WGBH-TV's NOVA science series.  It tells the                      extraordinary story behind the building of the Hale Telescope                   on Palomar Mountain in southern California.  The film also                      documents a research effort at the frontiers of astronomy that                  has pushed the Hale beyond anything its builders had imagined:                  The attempt to find and map the edge of the known universe.  It                 follows astronomers Maarten Schmidt, James Gunn and                             Don Schneider as they search for distant quasars.  This team                    recently detected a quasar that is by far the most distant                      object yet found in the universe; its discovery may challenge                   our current understanding of cosmic evolution.  The documentary                 is based on the award winning book First Light: The Search for                  the Edge of the Universe by Richard Preston.  After broadcast,                  the program will have wide educational distribution in                          secondary schools and colleges.",
