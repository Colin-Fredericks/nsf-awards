 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation and the State of Florida are                    providing funds to a consortium, consisting of Florida State                    University, The University of Florida, and Los Alamos National                  Laboratory, to establish a new National High Magnetic Field                     Laboratory.  The Florida/Los Alamos National Magnet Laboratory                  (FLNML) will be located at Florida State University, Tallahassee                and at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  FLNML will be a major                   user facility open to all qualified scientists and engineers.                   FLNML will develop a number of advanced high field magnets                      including a hybrid DC magnet with a design field capability of at               least 45T, a bore with a diameter of at last 32mm, and a 20MW                   low-ripple power supply, state-of-the-art superconducting magnets               for NMR in fields greater than 25T, intense pulsed field                        facilities capable of producing fields in excess of 75T for time                durations of msecs, and pulsed fields of 200T for microsec                      durations, and a variety of water-cooled magnets capable of the                 production of fields up to 25T.  In addition, FLNML will have                   available a comprehensive range of instrumentation to carry out                 experiments requiring these fields.  These magnets will be housed               in the Tallahassee facility, except for the pulsed field magnets                which will be located at Los Alamos.  The laboratory will also                  have a diverse in-house research and educational program                        involving faculty, post doctorals, and students from several                    disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials science,                    engineering, and biology.  Examples of research to be carried out               at the laboratory include high magnetic field studies of high                   temperature superconductors and high resolution NMR studies of                  the structure of complex biological molecules.",
