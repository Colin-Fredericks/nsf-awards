 "awd_abstract_narration": "The analysis of legal systems, like the analysis of social systems,             requires at its base an understanding of the categories of meaning              by which participants themselves comprehend their experience and                orient themselves toward one another in their everyday lives. The               day to day sharing, or contesting, of basic understandings are                  crucial aspects of the creation of moral communities that form the              cultural basis of social life.  Nowhere is the significance of                  these understandings brought into sharper focus than in the arena               of disputing.  In the social study of law, law is part of culture               and is understood in cultural terms.                                                                                                                            This project is an ethnographic study of dispute settlement in                  three neighborhoods of contrasting social composition and religious             orientation in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, Java.  The study              looks at dispute settlement at its least institutionalized levels,              especially mediation by community and religious leaders.  Through               interviews, extended case-study methods, and participant                        observation, the following issues are explored: (1) indigenous                  conceptions of dispute and disputing, order, and amity; (2)                     strategies and tactics employed by Javanese in resolving disputes;              (3) institutions and techniques available for the resolution of                 disputes and the choices made for settling disputes; (4) effect of              the choices on subsequent rhetoric of disputing; and  (5) how                   communities create and maintain moral cohesion and how social                   differentiation informs these issues.                                                                                                                           The research will result in substantial contributions to our                    understanding of the ways in which communities are created and                  maintained, particularly in a context of cultural and legal                     pluralism; of the evolution of legal systems; and of Javanese                   society.  By extension and implication, the results will have                   relevance to any of the world's socially and legally pluralistic                societies, especially developing and developed countries facing                 social transformation.",
