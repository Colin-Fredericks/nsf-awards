 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research consists of three separate, but related projects                  focusing on international financial institutions.  The first                    project will analyze the nature of the World Bank's third-world                 debt and compare it to the debt held by commercial banks.  Among                the important question to be analyzed are: (1) to what extent are               bank loans really aid?  (2) Does the financial structure of the                 World Bank affect the allocation of its loans across countries?                 Is the restructuring of third world debt appropriate?  The second               area of research looks at the coordination of fiscal policy                     across countries with different electorial structures and                       different timing of elections.  This research will consider both                pressures caused by staggered elections and possible mechanisms                 to mitigate these problems as they arise.  The final topic is an                analysis of how to design a central bank for a monetary union as                in the case of the European Monetary System.  This research is                  important because it will provide a better understanding of                     emerging financial arrangements and institutions in the third                   world and in Europe and how the U.S. might be affected changing                 international financial institutions.",
