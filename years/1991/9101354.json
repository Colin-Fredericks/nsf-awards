 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Artificial Intelligence project investigates part of the                   problem of discerning the coherence relationships within natural                language discourse.  The relationships of interest are between                  discourse components that describe or presuppose mental states                  (propositional attitudes).  The mental states can be those of the               speaker, listener, or any person mentioned by the discourse, and                can be states of belief, intention hope, desire, etc.  The focus                of this work is on descriptions that rely implicitly of explicity               on commonsense models of the mind that people often deploy, such                as the prevalent model of a mind and its beliefs as respectively                a physical container and some physical objects within it.                       Commonsense models are frequently relied upon in mental-state                   descriptions and are important factors in discourse coherence                   relationships, yet previous detailed work on representing and                   reasoning about mental states has largely skirted the issues.                   This research relates strongly, however, to work by psychologists               and linguists on metaphor and metonymy, because the commonsense                 models are metaphorical and metonymy is often involved as well.                 The project includes the development of a prototype AL discourse-               interpretation system, as well as major data collection                         activities:  collection of information about mental-state                       language through experiments with human subjects, and through                   semi-automated examination of diverse natural language texts,                   including definitions and examples in machine-readable                          dictionaries.  Annotated compendia of examples from these texts                 will be produced.  The project is also concered with the                        relationship between mental-state descriptions in English and                   those in other language, notably Spanish, with a view to                        contributing to machine-translation work at our laboratory.",
