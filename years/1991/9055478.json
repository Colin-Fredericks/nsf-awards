 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a collaborative effort between                          Wright State University faculty and the Trotwood-Madison                        (T-M) City School District to support the new textbook-free                     science curriculum at T-M with a strong science enhancement                     program for the 96 elementary classroom teachers in the                         district.  Scientists and science educators from Wright                         State University will provide training in hands-on science                      in the life (1st year) and physical sciences (2nd year),                        utilizing modular materials such as Fast Plants and Gems.                       The program will include 2 three-week summer sessions (5                        days/week, 6-8 hours/day), continuing education workshops                       throughout the school-year, end-of-year workshops, follow-                      up visits and guest lectures.  In addition, Wright State                        faculty will, on occasion, become \"substitute teachers\" to                      provide no-cost development time for the T-M teachers.                                                                                                          This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because it contains a strong science enhancement                        program designed to reach all of the elementary classroom                       teachers in the targeted school district.  It will provide                      teacher participants with opportunities to learn life and                       physical science concepts and science processes, and                            effective teaching methods.                                                                                                                                     Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately or 32% of the amount                      requested from NSF.",
