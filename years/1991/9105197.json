 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robust control has become the central focus of control                          systems research over the last 12 years.  The objective                         of this project is to bring together leading international                      control researchers to assess the state of knowledge in                         the rapidly advancing field of robust control.  In                              particular, several independent conceptual and                                  mathematical approaches have developed over the                                 years.  These are H-infinity optimal control, parametric                        robust stability based on Kharitonov's theorem and                              related topics, l1 optimal control, mu-analysis, and                            quantitative feedback theory.  This workshop will being                         together experts from each of these areas, for the first                        time.  This will produce a cross fertilization of ideas                         and lead to more effective approaches toward                                    developing solutions to the robust control problem.                             Some plenary talks and a concluding panel discussion                            are planned with this in mind.  The papers presented at                         the workshop will be published in book form.  The                               results of the workshop will have a very significant                            international impact on research, education, and                                engineering applications of robust control for many                             years to come.",
