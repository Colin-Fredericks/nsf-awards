The VLE system allows                  instructors to demonstrate to many students simultaneously, the                 structure and organisms of interest so that the students can devote             more quality time on their own to independent laboratory                        observations and work.  The equipment will be shared among the six              colleges making up the community college system, and has the                    potential to impact on several thousand students annually, many of              whom are from groups that are currently underrepresented in the                 sciences.",
