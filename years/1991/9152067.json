Biology and chemistry majors are employing these instruments in                 their studies of microbial growth under special conditions,                     dynamics of small-scale biotic systems, and GC analysis of                      organic pollutants in natural waters.  Majors proficient in GC                  water analysis are working with non-majors to apply that                        technology in freshman-level environmental science projects.                    These projects serve as key bridging elements in a two-course                   sequence for non-science majors consisting of a chemistry                       course followed by an environmental science course.                             Instrumental methods introduced in the chemistry course enable                  students to perform environmental science laboratory exercises                  consistent with current professional practices.  Significant                    features of this project include collaboration between science                  majors and non-majors to address environmental concerns and the                 development of an environmental science laboratory for non-                     majors.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-                   federal sources.",
