 "awd_abstract_narration": "The docking of India onto the Asian continent has resulted in              tremendous uplift throughout much of the Cenozoic.  Erosion of the              uplifted mountain ranges and deposition in tectonically depressed               basins has also resulted in one of the thickest and the most                    complete records of late Cenozoic.  Sediments spanning the last ~               20 Ma are well exposed in the Siwalik and Rawalpindi Group rocks                of the Potwar Plateau of northern Pakistan.  The earlier                        continental record is preserved to the South in the Sulaiman                    foreland basin, located in central Pakistan.  However, the Sulaiman             sequence lies almost completely within Tribal Territory and cannot              be accessed by foreigners (including the non-tribal Pakistani).                 Fortunately, there is one corner of the SUlaiman foreland basin                 that is accessible to non-native persons, the Zinda Pir Dome.  We               have targeted this area for a combined magneto-biostratigraphic                 study in order to extend the vertebrate fossil record into deposits             older that the 18.3 Ma limit found in the Potwar Plateau.  This                 project was initiated by Dr. E.H. Lindsay of the University of                  Arizona in 1987.  Lindsay and co-workers have completed three field             seasons (1988, 1989 and 1990).  During the last of these a number               of paleomagnetic samples were taken.  However, skepticism in the                community exists about the potential for success of the                         paleomagnetic investigations.  Since paleomagnetic data are                     essential to provide a chronostratigraphic framework, we are                    requesting limited support to analyze existing samples in order to              assess their reliability as paleomagnetic recorders.  As this study             necessarily carries some risk of failure, we are seeking funds                  specifically designated for \"small-scale, exploratory, high-risk\"               research.",
