 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project seeks to extend and broaden a study                  concerned with the general-circulation functioning of tropical                  climate anomalies and leads from diagnostics to prediction.  The                approach is primarily empirical, but is being combined with GCM                 applications.  The project shall over the next few years                        concentrate on (a) climate prediction for selected \"targets of                  opportunity\", (b) the relation of convection to surface                         temperature variations on the scale of the global tropics, (c)                  interannual and decadal-scale variations in the Indian Ocean                    monsoon systems, and (d) the South Atlantic Convergence Zone.                        (a) Climate prediction methods of high performance have been               developed for Northeast Brazil rainfall and Guyana river                        discharge.  In collaboration with local colleagues it is intended               to bring these to operational application.  Other \"targets of                   opportunity\" include the West African Sahel, the costal regions                 of Eastern Africa, and the Parana river catchment of southern                   South America.  (b) Interannual variations of convective patterns               over the global tropics shall be studied in relation to the                     varying surface temperature conditions, using a combination of                  novel surface, upper-air, and satellite-derived datasets;                       empirical analyses shall be complemented by GCM experiments.  (c)               Variations in the Indian Ocean monsoon systems shall be studied                 with particular attention to eastern Africa, where rainy seasons                fall into transitions in the planetary-scale annual cycle.  (d)                 The South Atlantic Convergence Zone is well developed in austral                summer when it plays an important role in the rainfall regime of                southern America.  A combination of novel data banks invites a                  comprehensive diagnostic investigation.  The project components                 are interrelated.  Thus, analyses of convection and surface                     temperature in the global tropics (b) also serve two regional                   diagnostic studies (c and d), which in turn create firmer                       foundations for prediction (a).                                                      This research is important because it seeks to provide an                  improved understanding of climate processes in the tropics, an                  area of the globe that has strong influence on the weather and                  climate over the remainder of our planet.",
