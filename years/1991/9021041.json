 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the increasing availability of message based distributed parallel          computing systems, the difficulties associated with constructing                parallel algorithms and mapping them onto parallel architectures have           grown in importance.  Currently, the algorithm development and                  programming process typically includes the explicit mapping of                  algorithm subtasks to processors.  This problem is typically dealt              with manually and often results in inefficient computation and                  communication load balancing which in turn leads to an overall                  reduction in the speedups potentially obtainable.                               The problem is exacerbated when distributed architectures are                   considered where processors and/or communications links are subject to          failure, yet must continue processing at reasonable rates with the              remaining computing resources.  This requires that process and data             checkpointing be done effectively and that, on detection and location           of failures, the system be reconfigured and tasks reallocated.  This            work focuses on the checkpointing and task reallocation problems.               This research program is aimed at investigating approaches to                   allocating tasks to processors in distributed computer systems whose            reliability characteristics have been characterized.  The goal is to            ensure effective use of the remaining distributed resources after               failure (processor or link) has occurred through the development of             distributed checkpointing and fast task reallocation schemes.",
