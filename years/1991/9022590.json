 "awd_abstract_narration": "By using the new isothermal plateau fission-track method of                dating tephra layers developed by Westgate, by applying a proven                detailed method for characterizing (fingerprinting) individual                  tephra layers, and by outlining the paleomagnetostratigraphy of the             loess, it is planned to develop a reliable and detailed                         chronostratigraphic framework for the 3 million year loess sequence             with the abundant tephra beds, and plant and animal remains near                Fairbanks, Alaska.  The long-studied loess exposures will now be                able to be tied together to create a veritable \"Rosetta Stone\",                 permitting the dating of detailed geologic, biologic, and climatic              records of environmental change in interior Alaska for late                     Cenozoic time.  This record then can be widely correlated from the              Yukon to eastern Siberia.                                                            The State of Alaska has created a Loess Study Preserve at Gold             Hill near Fairbanks where the loess record extends back 3 million               years, perhaps the oldest in the world.  Of the three detailed                  investigation trenches dug at this site, only one is completely                 studied; paleomagnetic dating is required on the other two.  Also,              only two of the many tephra have been dated here.  Continued                    detailed sedimentologic, tephrochronologic, and                                 paleomagnetostratigraphic work at this and other exposures near                 Fairbanks will strengthen the preliminary chronostratigraphic                   framework outlining the long, cold time periods of loess deposition             in tundra environments interspersed with forest environments of                 interglacial times.",
