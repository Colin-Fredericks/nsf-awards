 "awd_abstract_narration": "There have been many recent results in the p-adic theory of                modular forms, with emphasis on p-adic periods and p-adic analogues             of the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer.  The workshop                   supported by this grant will high-light the L-invariant, which                  appears as a factor of the leading Taylor coefficient of the p-adic             L-function of a 'split multiplicative' newform.  At least five                  independent interpretations of this invariant have been proposed in             recent years.  By bringing researchers together to discuss the                  underlying ideas, the workshop will contribute to a deeper                      understanding of the interdependence between p-adic Hodge theory,               analogues of the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, p-adic                uniformization theory, p-adic differential equations, and                       deformations of Galois representations.                                              The workshop will be held at Boston University in August,                  1991, and will bring together the leading researchers in this area              from the United States and abroad.  It will have a profound effect              on the graduate students and recent Ph.D.s who attend.  The results             of the workshop will be published in a conference proceedings.",
