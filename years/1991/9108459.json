 "awd_abstract_narration": "Certain genes are activated to express proteins when cells are                  stimulated in particular ways.  Within the nervous system, one                  gene of current interest is known as \"c-fos\" and there are two                  possible mechanisms that may activate its expression.  In some                  studies, high levels of activity in nerve cells apparently turn                 on c-fos expression.  There are some other studies that indicate                c-fos may be turned on instead by a change in normal levels of                  activity, suggesting a role for this gene in the phenomenon of                  neural plasticity.  Such plasticity is the property that allows a               nerve cell to change its output signal in relation to a given                   input, and is important in understanding properties of                          development and circuits underlying learning.  This exploratory                 (SGER) work will utilize the known directional sensitivity of                   cells in the visual system, in the retina of the eye and in the                 brain, to see what role c-fos expression plays during specific                  directional responsiveness.  Beyond its importance for visual                   neuroscience, a high impact on neuroscience in general is likely                if this work develops a way of specifically staining an entire                  physiological class of individual nerve cells, since such direct                demonstrations of structure and function are usually done one                   cell at a time.  There is a further great potential impact on                   neuroscience, particularly sensory and developmental                            neuroscience, by clarifying how genetic expression is related to                neuronal activity and plasticity.",
