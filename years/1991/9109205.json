A research program in determining the relationship                  between structural and physical interconnect in IC design is being              planned.  Typical area estimates for the structural design of an                IC count the number and size of the structural modules, but ignores             interconnect, which can use significant chip space.  The approach               is to design experiments which explore the relationships between                register-transfer (RT) measures and area devoted to interconnects.              Experiments are being conducted with designs produced by IC                     synthesis tools and statistical evaluation is being used to                     determine correlations.  The first experiment is to establish                   relationships between the RT design and the physical design                     independent of particular cell bindings.  The second experiment is              to determine if a relationship exists among RT measures and                     interconnect area, and to characterize that relationship.",
