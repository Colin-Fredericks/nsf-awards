 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major strength of relational databases lies in their ability                to process data in a set-at-a-time manner.  An important                        drawback, however, is their inability to handle rules.                          Aninformation system must allow users to define, represent and                  manipulate rules just as easily as data and treat them in a                     common framework.  Such a system is called a knowledge-based                    system.  The objective of this research is to investigate the                   feasibility of developing such a framework for integrating rules                and data within a relational database system. This research                     develops and evaluates techniques for integration in this manner,               and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of such an approach.                Consequently, it focuses on the following issues: extending a                   relational language like SQL to express rules, storing and                      manipulating rules in an efficient manner, developing query                     processing algorithms (this will also involve designing new data                structures), implementing the algorithms and evaluating their                   performance.  This work draws to a large extent on existing                     literature and theory in the area of relational database systems,               deductive databases, and also on existing work in the areas of                  artificial intelligence and expert systems.  The findings will be               useful for the designers of next-generation database systems.",
