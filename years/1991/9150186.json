 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council is                   concerned about the state of science education in the Nation's                  schools.  This project will address the issue of teacher                        enhancement for teachers of biology and the life sciences.                                                                                                      The Board on Biology will convene an expert committee to                        examine selected inservice activities currently available to                    secondary-school biology teachers.  Since biology is one of                     the most widely offered and most frequently taken courses in                    middle and high school, a focus on continuing education of                      biology teachers should have an impact on the quality of                        science education offered to most, if not all students.  The                    committee will consider important recent advances in biology,                   links between content and pedagogy, the curricula and teaching                  materials currently available, and the possible use of new                      technologies to improve teaching and learning.  Emphasis will                   be placed on collaborative projects and will consider ways to                   maintain linkages between teachers and scientists after the                     completion of the formal inservice training.                                                                                                                    Most importantly, the components of exemplary programs will be                  identified that can serve as templates for the development of                   future inservice programs for both public and private                           organizations.  As such, it will contribute significantly to                    the set of materials on biology education already published                     and disseminated by the Academy.",
