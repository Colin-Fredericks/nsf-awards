One topic is problem solving using approximate data, as occurs if the           actual data must be either approximated through experimentation or              rounded for computation.  Attempts will be made to lay some                     foundations for a complexity theory which incorporates approximate              data, in contrast to traditional complexity theory where exact                  rational data is required.  Some emphasis will be given to devising             efficient algorithms for solving certain problems using approximate             data, most notably linear programming problems.                                                                                                                 Another topic is computational real semi-algebraic geometry, e.g.,              quantifier elimination methods for the first order theory of the                reals.  Attention will be given to a few well-known open problems in            this area as well as to the common ground between it and numeric                computation.  This common ground is a natural place to build a general          theory of condition numbers as well as to study extensions of standard          problems in numeric computation such as solution approximation.",
