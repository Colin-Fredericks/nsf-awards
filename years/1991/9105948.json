 "awd_abstract_narration": "The history of Great Plains climate and the responses of the               physical and biologic systems to climate changes in the last 10,000             yrs. need to be well understood if we are to make accurate                      predictions of the consequences of global warming for this region.              Several global climate models have projected the Great Plains as                the most likely region in the U.S. to experience prolonged drought              conditions in the next decades.  In this light, the chronology and              paleoclimatic interpretations of sand dune formation and activity               in the now-stabilized dunes which occupy some 50,000 km  of west-               central Nebraska--the Nebraska Sand Hills-- take on considerable                importance.  Although some workers believe that the major period                of dune activity coincided with the maximum advance of continental              glaciers (about 18,000 years ago) and the most of the dunes have                been stable since that time, evidence is accumulating that much of              the dune field, although possibly formed during the Ice Age, has                been remobilized several times in the last 10,000 years.  The                   organic-rich lake or marsh sediments that formed between stabilized             dunes can be radiocarbon-dated.  If only one or two samples from                a single interdune area are dated, the history of deposition                    appears simple.  Additional dated samples may show that the filling             interdune swales was episodic, not gradual; gaps in the record                  should coincide with periods of moving dunes.  Many more                        radiocarbon dates from strategically-located core and drill holes               across interdunes and dunes to settle the controversy surrounding               the history of the Sand Hills.",
