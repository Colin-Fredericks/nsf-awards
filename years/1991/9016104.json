 "awd_abstract_narration": "The understanding of the transport phenomena associated with                    the melting of packed particulate beds is critical to our                       ability to predict processes which occur during severe nuclear                  power plant accidents, or for the containment of radioactive                    wastes through in situ vitrification, and for a wide range of                   materials processing techniques which depend on powders as a                    raw material.  This program, the first indepth study of heat                    and mass transfer during melting of packed particulate beds,                    involves both experimental and numerical research.  The                         objective is to determine the transport properties for melting                  packed beds essential to modelling the melting process.  These                  properties include effective thermal conductivity, capillary                    pressure, and relative permeability.  In addition, the shape                    of melting particles is critical to modelling the                               densification which occurs during melting.  The results of                      this research will enable the melting process to be accurately                  modelled.  This will allow the process to be designed to                        achieve desired objectives in a wide range of applications                      ranging from vitrification of hazardous wastes to the                           production of new materials.",
