 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grooming is a very common behavior of mammals, including African                antelope.  This project is an integrated field and experimental                 approach to understanding the interaction of utilitarian (tick                  removal) and social aspects of grooming of impala.  Impala are                  ideal subjects for this type of project.  The animals are common                in eastern and southern Africa and can be watched for long                      periods of time to accumulate quantitative data.  Impala are also               ideal subjects because they display a type of highly reciprocal                 mutual grooming that is unique among antelope and possibly among                all mammals.                                                                                                                                                    The field studies comprise behavioral observations, sampling of                 tick loads on the various age-sex groups of impala to correlate                 with grooming rates, and assessment of ticks in the environment                 to correlate with tick loads.  Behavioral observations on mutual                grooming will examine the social influences on the grooming                     system, which may be one of the few genuine animal examples of                  evolved cooperation.  Systematic field studies are needed to                    fully explore this unusual behavior.  The part of the project                   dealing with mutual grooming explores a complex system in an                    ungulate species where the formation of social bonds and                        alliances is much simpler than in primates.                                                                                                                     This multidisciplinary approach to understanding the role of                    self-grooming and mutual grooming in the control of ectoparasites               is expected to contribute information critical to the management                and conservation of wildlife in African environments where                      domestic livestock farming is encroaching upon the habitat of the               wildlife.",
