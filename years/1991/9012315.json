 "awd_abstract_narration": "During shoot growth all plants progress through morphologically                 and physiologically distinct juvenile and adult developmental                   phases. The mechanism regulating the expression of these phases                 and the transition from one phase to another is poorly                          understood, particularly in herbaceous plants where the juvenile                phase is often brief. The Teopod (Tp) mutations of maize prolong                the expression of juvenile traits, and thereby provide an                       opportunity to study the genetic basis of phase change in a                     herbaceous species. To determine the function of these genes it                 is necessary to identify their products and study how they are                  expressed during shoot growth. Ac-induced mutations of Tp2 will                 be identified and used to clone this gene. The structure and the                sequence of this gene will be determined and transcribed regions                of the locus will be used as probes to study its expression in                  both normal and mutant plants. These experiments will initially                 be performed by Northern analysis and later by in situ                          hybridization. To facilitate the cloning and genetic analysis of                both this and the other Tp genes, an RFLP map of the region                     surrounding each gene will be constructed. The function of the Tp               loci will also be studied by determining their effect on the                    expression of genes whose expression is normally limited to                     either the juvenile or adult phase of shoot growth. These latter                studies will reveal whether the character of the shoot is                       determined by a series of sequential programs, or in a                          combinatorial fashion by parallel developmental programs.",
