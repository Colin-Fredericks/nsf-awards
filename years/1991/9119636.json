 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, submitted by the National Action Council for                     Minorities in Engineering, is for $262,643 and will support an                  effort to develop a one-year,  dual component faculty/student                   cultural diversity program for improving the engineering school                 environment for minority students.  The faculty component would                 focus on increasing the sensitivity of engineering faculty to                   cultural differences within their student population and the                    importance of considering these differences within the advising                 role.  The student component would be geared to helping them learn              to cope with an environment that is likely to be significantly                  different from any previous educational experience.  A pilot                    program would be carried out between April 1992 and March 1993.                 From April 1993 to June 1994, NACME would be involved in helping                the engineering program pilot site take the program through its                 second year.  During those 15 months NACME would also be involved               in identifying other engineering school programs that would                     institute a program based on the model program.",
