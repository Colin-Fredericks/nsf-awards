 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research attempts to gain a better understanding of the               intrinsic properties of complete sets for many natural complexity               classes.  The research will explore how the complexity-theoretic                properties of complete sets are affected by the strength of the                 reducibilities defining them, and the relationships between these               properties and the central problems in complexity theory.  One such             property is immunity, which examines whether all complete problems              have larger subproblems which are easier to solve than the full                 problem.  This research bears upon the existence of certain types of            approximations to these intractable sets.  Another area of study is             the strength of efficient reductions between pairs of complete sets             and the possibility of reductions from complete sets to sparse sets or          other sets with a particular structure.  The relationships between the          complexity-theoretic results in these areas and other current research          problems such as the isomorphism problem and the existence of certain           types of one-way functions are a central focus of this work.",
