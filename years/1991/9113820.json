 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the late 1940s, the violent upheavals in the developing world             have generated a flood of political refugees variously estimated                as between 40 and 75 million people.  While politically induced                 migrations have occurred throughout human history, the number of                political refugees appears to have reached an historical peak.                  This flow of refugees has important legal dimensions as this                    migration seems rooted in the increasing interdependence of the                 world and the globalization of social and ethnic conflicts.                                                                                                     Dr. Jenkins seeks to address this issue through studying refugee                flows across a wide sample of national boundaries between 1955 and              1990.  The core of this work is a cross-national quantitative                   analysis of the social and political sources of the world-wide                  explosion in the number of political refugees.  Drawing on time                 series and lagged-panel regression, the analysis will investigate               various hypotheses pertaining to the globalization of social                    conflicts that have been advanced to account for the growth and                 intensity of the refugee problem.  By constructing an annualized                account of the initiation, intensity, and duration of refugee                   flows, the research will be able to illuminate the sources of civil             instability and the effects of instability, wars, famines, and                  facilitative conditions on refugee migrations.                                                                                                                  This study will substantially advance our understanding of the                  causes of refugee migration over the past several decades.  The                 effort to construct and evaluate annual data on refugee migration               and populations for 152 countries for 35 years will be a valuable               scientific contribution in and of itself as is the development of               this data resource.  As important, however, is the relationship of              this project to recent theoretical developments.  In recent years,              theoretical attention has focused on refugee producing situations               and away from conceptualizing refugee migrations as idiosyncratic.              This work constitutes the first major test of such theoretical                  ideas.",
