 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many cells in the cortex of the brain respond best to highly                    specific stimuli, and the neural mechanisms that \"tune\" the                     cell's response remain largely unclear.  For a given cell in the                visual cortex, it is possible to define its \"receptive field\" as                the area in visual space in which an appropriate visual stimulus                (for example a light bar, or a moving edge, or even a complex                   shape) causes a recordable response in the cell.  There may be a                particular combination of both spatial and temporal features of                 that stimulus that elicit the \"best\" response from the cell.                                                                                                    This project will examine the relations between receptive                       field structure and responses to slowly moving visual gratings                  (series of light and dark bars).  Repetitive presentations of                   such drifting gratings in one direction cause adaptation in the                 cell, so its response decreases to the movement in one direction,               but not to movement in the other.  Single cell activity will be                 recorded to map out the receptive field to a single bar stimulus                before, during, and after the selective adaptation to the                       grating, to see how the receptive field changes.  A mathematical                model will be used to describe both response strength and timing                across the receptive field.  The results will be interpreted in                 terms of neural inputs to the cortical cells, with an emphasis on               how the spatial and temporal components contribute to the timing                of cortical responses.  These studies provide a novel approach to               the important question of how visual cortical response properties               are generated from convergence of different types of inputs,                    and will have an impact across sensory neuroscience and                         computational neuroscience.",
