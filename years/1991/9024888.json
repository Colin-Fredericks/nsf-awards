 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests salary subvention for three academic staff               members involved in the critical step of editing manuscripts and                certain other final costs of preparing The Jepson Manual:  Vascular             Plants of California.  The Jepson Manual is a comprehensive,                    authoritative, concise, accessible, and up-to-date treatment of the             botanically richest region in the United States (ca. 7,800                      infrageneric taxa, or at least a quarter of the higher plant taxa               of North America outside Mexico).  It has been in preparation for               eight years and now involves 180 contributing authors and a staff               of seven; it will be published by the end of 1992.  The Jepson                  Manual Project is of national significance because of its role in               stimulating systematic research, its close relationship to the                  Flora of North America Project, the richness and complex                        relationships of Californian plant taxa (many of which are endemic              or endangered), and its development and use of several new kinds                of information.  The single, reasonable priced volume is designed               as a bridge between the developers and dispensers of systematic                 information (systematic botanists) and the highly diverse,                      potential users of that information.",
