 "awd_abstract_narration": "In projects (1) and (2) the focus is on obtaining bounds on                   the number of integral solutions of certain classes of                          diophantine equations over function fields which depend only                    on the number of monomials of the equation.  This problem which                 seemed so inaccessible a few years ago, has recently made                       significant progress and the success is largely due to the abc-                 inequality.  The proposed research in project (3) is to                         investigate Siegels conjecture over complex number fields.                      Project (4) deals with Thue's equation F(x,y)=1 over the                        rational.  The object here is to show that the number of                        integral solutions can be bounded in terms of the number of                     large coefficients of F only.                                                     The project is in an area of number theory where the methods                  of proof are extremely complicated and technical.  It furthers                  VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for women to                    advance their careers in science or engineering through                         research, and to encourage other women to pursue careers in                     these areas through the investigators' enhanced visibility as                   role models on the host campuses.  In this project, the                         proposed activities which contribute to the second objective                    include:  teaching a graduate course, co-sponsoring the Number                  Theory seminar, and organizing a new seminar.  The aim of the                   last project is to offer women mathematicians greater                           stimulation in research and interaction with other                              mathematicians.",
