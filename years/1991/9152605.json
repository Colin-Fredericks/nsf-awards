This project develops an                           introductory course which concentrates on psychology as a                       laboratory science studying physiological and cognitive                         processes (a separate course already covers the social and                      applied areas of psychology).  A series of laboratory projects                  is used to organize and introduce the means and methods (as                     well as the results) of three of psychology's main divisions of                 research: Physiological Processes, Sensation and Perceptual                     Processing, and Learning, Memory, and Cognition.  The addition                  of six computers allows students to participate as subjects and                 experimenters (e.g. demonstration of iconic memory, the                         Sternberg task and working memory, semantic priming, etc.).                     Four of these computers are equipped with psychophysiological                   measurement modules for monitoring muscle activity, heart rate,                 and skin conductance allowing students to reproduce basic                       psychophysiological phenomena (e.g. elicitation and habituation                 of orienting, classical conditioning and modification of                        reflexes, etc.). This curriculum will prepare departmental                      majors for their required sequence of research courses and                      increase the scientific literacy of non-majors taking the                       course as an elective.",
