 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many geographers, psychologists, and other cognitive scientists            have conducted research on the ways that people acquire knowledge about         spatial patterns and relationships.  Researchers disagree about the             process by which people gain knowledge of more complex spatial                  principles like distance, connectivity, regional structure, and spatial         stratification.  Some contend that this type of knowledge is acquired           through aggregation of insights gained through single experiences.              Others argue that such knowledge is more quickly and completely                 obtained through direct exposure to media like maps that directly               present spatial information in configurational formats.  This project           will test the validity of these two contentions through a set of                comparative experiments.  Subjects will be separated into two groups.           People in one group will be shown series of slides that represent               ground-level views along routes that those individuals might travel.            People in the other group will be shown maps covering the same routes.          Members of both groups will be asked to conduct a series of tasks that          test their abilities to recognize spatial patterns and distributions,           to reconstruct routes, to recognize the proximity of locations, and to          identify regional and hierarchical relationships.  The accuracy and             speed of answers will be measured and tested to determine whether those         who acquire information through the \"bottoms up\" approach replicated by         viewing the slides retain gain as much configurational knowledge as             those who have the \"birdseye\" perspectives from viewing maps.                        This project will directly test hypotheses about the efficacy of           different means of obtaining spatial information.  The results of these         experiments will significantly enhance our knowledge of how people form         spatial understandings, of why they behave as they do in different              spatial contexts, and how geographic education might be altered to              become more effective.",
