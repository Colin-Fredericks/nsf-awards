Reinforced concrete frame structures                                            constructed in the U.S. during the                                              1950's and 1960's often include                                                 non-ductile details associated with                                             poor seismic performance.  The                                                  behavior of these details has been                                              studied experimentally.  This                                                   project addresses strategies for                                                improving the seismic performance of                                            these structures.  The objectives of                                            the research are:  (1) to outline                                               strategies for retrofit of                                                      non-ductile concrete frame                                                      structures, (2) to investigate                                                  retrofit strategies based on                                                    improving the strength and ductility                                            of critical frame details and                                                   regions, (3) to provide a                                                       methodology for evaluating retrofit                                             frames, (4) to use the methodology                                              to estimate the levels of strength                                              and ductility needed for critical                                               regions, and (5) to recommend                                                   guidelines for strength and                                                     ductility improvement.                                                                                                                                          A series of non-ductile concrete                                                frame structures will be analyzed                                               and retrofit strategies will be                                                 formulated.  Analytical models will                                             be calibrated with recent                                                       experimental results.  Retrofit                                                 frames will be analyzed and retrofit                                            strategies will be evaluated.                                                   Guidelines for appropriate levels of                                            critical region strength and                                                    ductility will be developed, and a                                              methodology for assessing retrofit                                              strategies will be provided.  The                                               guidelines and methodology will                                                 assist other researchers in                                                     developing retrofit techniques, and                                             will assist practicing engineers in                                             the retrofit of existing structures.                                            The project will include                                                        interactions with other researchers                                             and practicing engineers in the                                                 seismic design of buildings.",
