 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Anne Pike-Tay will                study the teeth of nearly 1000 reindeer/caribou individuals which               were assembled by the Canadian Wildlife Service.  This is the                   largest and most statistically representative sample of a modern                reindeer population. The exact date of death, age in months, sex,               size, weight, reproductive condition, diet and geographic range                 are documented for each specimen.  For each, she will measure the               crown height above the mandible and also section individual teeth               to study the cementum annuli.  These latter structures are                      usually deposited annually much like tree rings and serve to                    anchor the tooth in the jaw. Together these measures permit one                 to estimate the age of an animal as well as the season of death.                Dr. Pike-Tay has two goals. The first is a quantitative                         evaluation of the biological and environmental factors which                    affect cementum deposition.  This will allow better seasonality                 determinations.  Secondly, she will analyze the annuli and crown                height measurements to derive techniques for age estimation.                                                                                                    Reindeer provided an important source of food and other materials               such as antler and hide for prehistoric peoples in both North                   America and Europe.  Their bones are often found in                             archaeological sites and therefore constitute an important focus                for archaeological analysis.  In their attempts to reconstruct                  how prehistoric peoples lived, archaeologists try to determine                  how long and in what season individual sites were occupied.  They               also want to learn how animals were hunted. By knowing a                        reindeer's age of death and the season in which it was killed                   these questions can be directly addressed.  While many scientists               have recognized the potential of crown height measurements and                  annuli counts, the basic essential work which Dr. Pike-Tay has                  undertaken has never been done.                                                                                                                                 This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 an extremely valuable tool not only to archaeologists ,but to                   biologists and wildlife management specialists.  It will be                     applicable in a wide variety of situations.  Since a graduate                   student is included, the project will also serve a training role.",
