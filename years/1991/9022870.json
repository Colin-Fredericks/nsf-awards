 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on a new technology, the \"Queue                       Inference Engine\" (QIE), which is a set of statistical                          procedures that allows one to infer with precision the                          performance of many important queues (waiting lines) without                    ever observing them.  Using only transactional data --                          service initiation and completion times -- all of the key                       performance measures for Poisson arrival queueing systems                       can be obtained.  Under NSF SBIR Phase I funding, substantial                   research progress was made, building on the original QIE                        mathematics developed by Dr. Richard C. Larson at the                           Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and addressing                           research problems likely to occur in practical implementation                   settings.                                                                            The OIE has proven to be a uniquely accurate and                           unobtrusive tool for measuring near real-time queue behavior                    in a variety of settings.  The research will be carried out                     cooperatively with two major U.S. service organizations and                     is designed to evolve an installable prototype OIE that is                      relatively \"bulletproof\" in typical application settings.                       Using a sequence of three empirical methods involving a                         combination of analyses of videotaped observations and Monte                    Carlo simulations, Q.E.D. will examine light traffic                            situations, inter-service time gaps, heavy traffic congestion                   periods and sensor-based data augmentation.",
