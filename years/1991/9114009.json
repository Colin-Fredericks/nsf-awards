 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is in the joint ENG/CISE Research Thrust in Intelligent              Material Handling Systems.  The objective is to develop and                     demonstrate a novel intelligent material handling system approach               that allows very rapid automation of any new                                    material handling requirements and that can deal with uncertainties             in the environment.  The approach incorporates four basic                       components for intelligent materials handling with applications to              automated kitting and fixturing.  The Component Program for                     Autonomous, Adaptable agents emphasizes the specification of                    flexible manufacturing cells, including manipulators and fixtures,              to adapt to dynamic environments and to cooperate with other                    systems.  The Component Program for CAD-Based Material                          Representation utilizes 3-D feature-based models which include                  features for both material handling and vision recognition.                     through a process of reverse engineering using vision and range                 sensors with interactive graphics.  The Component Program for                   Material Handling Control addresses the design and selection of                 real-time control strategies for material handling, including                   robust, adaptive, and learning schemes with integrated sensor                   feedback.  A high level path and trajectory planning system are                 used to guide the control system based on the feature-based CAD                 information.   The fourth Component Program is responsible for the              Systems Integration Methodology to support the design and                       development of cooperating, distributed agents, and allows                      transition from human- intensive activities to more autonomous                  activities.",
