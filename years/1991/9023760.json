Non-rectangular geometries, such as                                 trapezoidal cross sections, will be investigated.                               2) Electrostatic Force Calculations for Micromotors                             - Perturbation Method will be extended to solve                                 three-dimensional electrostatic force field                                     calculations.  The effects of resistivity in the                                materials will also be included.

The results of (I.I) and this task will                           be summarized to provide a comprehensive data                                   base for microchannel flows.                                                    2) Electrostatic Force Calculations for Micromotors                             - The results of (1.3) will be extended to perform                              electrostatic force calculations on the Macintosh II                            family of computers.  The code will be extended                                 such that electrostatic force calculations will be                              performed on drawings imported from CAD                                         programs.                                                                       3) Hydrodynamic Drag and Lift in Micromotors                                    and Other Microstructures - Spectral Element                                    Method will be applied to study the detailed flow                               field of micromotors with uniform cross section                                 rotors.  The results will be combined with the                                  results of (I.2) and (II.2) and compared to the                                 recently reported stroboscopic experimental work                                measuring the transient dynamics of a micromotor.                               Phase III                                                                       1) Hydrodynamic Bearings for Microdynamical                                     Devices - The comprehensive results of (I.1-3) and                              (II.1-3) will be applied to investigate the methods of                          reducing drag and increasing lift of microdynamical                             devices.  The use of hydrodynamic forces to center                              the rotor of micromotors under the applied                                      electrostatic field will also be investigated.                                  2) Reduced Order Model Development - The                                        comprehensive results of (I.1-3) and (II.1-3) will be                           carefully tabulated to develop a scientific data base                           for microdynamical devices and systems.  Simplified                             sets of equations will be developed for both                                    transport phenomena and electromechanical                                       dynamics, and their relative accuracy will be                                   determined by comparing the results to those from                               (I.1-3) and (II.1-3).  The reduced order models will                            be useful for developing means to conduct design                                optimization studies before hardware fabrication, as                            well as closed loop control strategies for                                      microdynamical devices and systems.",
