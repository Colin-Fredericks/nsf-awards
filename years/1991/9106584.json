 "awd_abstract_narration": "Birman will investigate knot theory, with a particular focus               on the applications of the theory of braids to the classification               of knots and links.  The first project, with Menasco, aims at an                algorithmic solution to the link problem via the theory of                      braids.  If successful, work on the main theorem, which may be                  described as \"Markov's Theorem with stabilization,\" will                        establish the existence of an algorithmic solution to the knot                  problem by showing that there is a series of complexity-reducing                moves which take an arbitrary closed braid representative of a                  knot to one which has minimum complexity.  The implementation of                the algorithm will require, in addition, recognizing when certain               complexity-reducing moves are applicable.  The second project is                an investigation of the knot invariants of Vassiliev.  One goal                 is to estimate the number of Vassiliev invariants of order i, and               perhaps prove that this number grows without bound.  The third                  concerns John Moody's recent counterexample to the faithfulness                 of Burau representations and its relevance to the corresponding                 question for the Jones representations.  Birman hopes to identify               the kernel of the Burau representation.  The final project                      concerns understanding whether the collection of all Jones                      invariants can be faithful on knot and link types.                                   Morgan intends to work on three related areas of topology:                 (i) actions of groups on trees; (ii) computation of Donaldson                   invariants for algebraic surfaces, using algebraic geometry; and                (iii) computations of Donaldson invariants of 4-manifolds which                 are made of two pieces joined by a long cylindrical tube.  The                  first project, with R. Skora, concerns the classification of free               actions of groups on R-trees, and in particular, the question of                which groups act freely.  They have been studying groups which                  are certain types of non-trivial free products with amalgamation                or HNN-extensions.  They propose to expand this study to more                   general amalgams.  Projects (ii) and (iii) concern Donaldson's                  invariants for smooth 4-manifolds.  Project (ii) explores                       connections with algebraic geometry.  Morgan and R. Friedman have               partially computed these invariants for elliptic surfaces of                    general type and propose to extend their computations, especially               those for elliptic surfaces.  Project (iii) explores some purely                analytic, differential geometric questions, particularly, the ASD               connections of finite energy on infinite cylinders, in order to                 provide a link between embedded riemann surfaces in a 4-manifold                and the values of the Donaldson invariant.                                           These are projects in topology which interact heavily with                 other areas of mathematics, e.g., algebra, algebraic geometry,                  and even mathematical physics.  Progress could take many                        different forms, and it is encouraging to note the variety of                   interested parties.",
