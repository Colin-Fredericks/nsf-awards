The new course, made up of a series                  of integrated teaching units, focuses on the total system                       within which modern engineering operates and on the centrality                  of innovation for engineering.  The course also introduces                      students to techniques for more effective communication through                 written and visual means.  In addition to the teaching units                    and the course itself, a network of teachers is established to                  disseminate the new materials.  These materials introduce                       students to the scientific basis for engineering, the social                    context within which modern engineering arises, and the                         intimate relationship between engineering and modern culture.",
