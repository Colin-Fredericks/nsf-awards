 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a Long-Term Research Visit to the Australian            National University (ANU) by Professor Jay E. Anderson, Department of           Biological Sciences, Idaho State University.  The visit takes place             under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program.  While in                 Australia, Professor Anderson will collaborate with Professor Graham            D. Farquhar, Research School of Biological Sciences, ANU, and Dr.               Michael P. Austin, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research              Organization (CSIRO).  The objectives of the project are (1) to                 determine whether the observed distributions of three species of                Eucalyptus in southeastern Australia are related to differences in              the efficiency with which the different species use water, and (2)              to resolve whether variation in water use efficiency among species              results from inherent differences in photosynthetic or other                    physiological processes (including stomatal) involving the leaf, or             whether differences in ability to acquire nutrients, especially                 nitrogen, from the soil are responsible.   The results are relevant             to agricultural and silvicultural selection programs aimed at                   identifying plant species and genotypes that are superior in water              use efficiency, as well as to efforts to understand mechanisms that             underlie the natural distribution of species.  Professor Anderson               will carry out this research while on sabbatical leave from Idaho               State University.  He will study eucalypts in Australia subjected to            gradients in mean annual temperature and in mean annual rainfall.               The effect of nitrogen level on plant growth, photosynthetic                    capacity, stomatal conductance, carboxylation efficiency, water use             efficiency, and nitrogen use efficiency will be studied.                                                                                                        Both the U.S. and Australian groups have experience in this area of             research.  Previous work by Professor Anderson and his group in                 Idaho has shown that nitrogen fertilization improves water use                  efficiency among native species.  Professor Farquhar and his                    colleagues at ANU have been responsible for many advances in the                understanding of the efficiency of water use by plants, and have                provided both theoretical models and empirical evidence relating                carbon isotope discrimination in the photosynthetic process to water            use efficiency.  Dr. Austin, of CSIRO's Division of Wildlife and                Ecology, is a leading international vegetation scientist who has                studied eucalypt distributions in gradients of temperature and                  rainfall.  Experimental facilities at ANU, including an analytical              laboratory for performing isotopic and other analyses, will greatly             facilitate the carrying out of this research project.",
