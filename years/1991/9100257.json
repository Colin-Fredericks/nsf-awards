 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electromigration failure of polycrystalline aluminum interconnects              is one of the primary failure mechanisms limiting the reliability               of integrated circuits.  In this research, Monte Carlo simulations              and analytical studies will be made of a model of electromigration              failure in polycrystalline metal thin films based on percolation                theory.  The dependence of the average film lifetime and the                    distributions of lifetimes on the temperature and degree of                     structural disorder will be investigated.  An empirical                         distribution for the film lifetime which is commonly employed in                engineering applications will be compared to the Monte Carlo                    results, providing a test of this distribution for much lower                   failure rates than is possible experimentally.  A theory of the                 failure kinetics will be constructed which is based on recent                   advances in the theory of irreversible processes in random media.               As time permits, these ideas will be applied to the related problem             of fatigue-induced fracture in inhomogeneous brittle materials.                 %%%                                                                             As integrated circuits become smaller and smaller, the problem of               how to connect elements within these circuits, and the circuits                 themselves to the outside world, becomes more critical.  As these               connections, or interconnects, become smaller, the probability that             circuit failure may occur in the interconnect increases.  Thus, an              understanding of the underlying mechanisms and of the probability               for interconnect failure are important for predicting lifetimes of              devices.  This grant is using an unconventional approach to look at             this difficult problem.  Percolation theory looks at conducting                 systems such as interconnects from a general point of view.  It is              not as concerned about the underlying physical details as with the              more global aspects of the problem.  The research proposed here                 will use percolation theory for the first time to try to make                   predictions of interconnect lifetimes and determine general                     parameters which affect interconnect failure.",
