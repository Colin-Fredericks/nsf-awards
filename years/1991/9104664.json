 "awd_abstract_narration": "This meeting on Molecular Biology of Signal Transduction in Plants              will be an open international meeting devoted to fundamental                    research on different aspects of this field, with emphasis on                   molecular and genetic approaches.  The development of a higher                  plant is regulated by a multitude of signals from within and                    without, that evoke both generalized and specific biological                    responses.  Therefore an understanding of signal transduction in                plants is vital to understanding plant development.  The need for               a meeting on this subject is evidenced by the rapid advances in                 this field during the last few years, in areas that range from                  environmental receptors to transcription factors.  This meeting                 will allow presentation of recent results and methodologies in                  these different aspects of the field within a common framework, in              an atmosphere of face to face contact.  The areas to be covered by              the meeting are 1) Environmental Receptors, 2) Hormone Receptors                3) Cell-Cell Recognition 4) G-proteins and Protein Kinases 4)                   Transcription Factors, 5) Mutants in Signalling Pathways 6)                     Transgenic Approaches.                                                                                                                                          This international conference will promote further research and the             synthesis of ideas in the rapidly moving field of cellular signal               transduction in plants.",
