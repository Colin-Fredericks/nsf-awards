These are: I) activation of peroxides by iron and cobalt                        complexes, II) activation of dioxygen by iron complexes, III)                   ligand centered redox reactions of metal complexes, IV) the                     chemistry of superoxide, V) development of a model for the heme                 containing component of cytochrome c oxidase, VI) development                   of a model for the manganese cofactor of photosystem II, and                    VII) the characterization of the nucleophilicity of peroxides                   towards electrophilic centers such as sulfur dioxide, chlorine,                 and chlorinated, aromatic hydrocarbons.                                         %%%                                                                             In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                     metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Donald T.                       Sawyer of Texas A&M University will continue studies of the                     reactivity and activation of oxygen, superoxide, and peroxides.                 This work will increase our understanding of such diverse                       topics as biological oxidation, combustion processes, and                       decontamination of some environmentally hazardous chemicals                     such as chlorinated hydrocarbons.",
