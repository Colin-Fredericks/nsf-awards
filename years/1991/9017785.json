 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental problem in extensional tectonics is unraveling-               three dimensions-the growth and evolution of half-graben-type                  basins and their basin-bounding faults.  This is a project to                   analyze the transverse and along-strike variations in basin                     subsidence through a study of changes in thickness and facies of                fixed-period Milankovitch-type lacustrine cycles recorded in six                cores to be drilled as part of another NSF-funded research project              as well as from correlatable outcrops from other parts of the early             Mesozoic Newark rift basin of New York, New Jersey, and                         Pennsylvania.  Such an analysis will also aid in the identification             of synsedimentary structures.  Variations in cycle thicknesses in               a vertical section will be used to constrain the factors affecting              the basin's historical (evolutionary) development, including its                growth through time.  Mass-balance basin filling models,                        constrained by the known geometry of the basin (based on available              seismic reflection profiles) as well as by variations in                        subsidence, will be constructed to assess the \"background\" or                   intrinsic effects of uniform subsidence and extension rates and                 uniform input rates of sediment and water on generating the basin's             stratigraphic record.  Deviations of the actual stratigraphy                    (recorded in the cores) from the filling model's simplified                     predictions can then be used to assess changes in subsidence and                extension rates as well as changes in sediment and water supply.                In addition to furthering our understanding of the three-                       dimensional development of half-graben, this study also will                    constrain the early rifting history of Pangaea in eastern North                 America.",
