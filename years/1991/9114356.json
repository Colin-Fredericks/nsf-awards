 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Robert Drennan, Mr. Augusto Oyuela-                  Caycedo will collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  During                previous work near the town of San Jacinto, Columbia, Mr. Oyuela-               Caycedo located a series of sites one of which, San Jacinto 1,                  contained pottery which radiocarbon dated to ca. 5940 years ago.                The sherds were recovered in a secure stratigraphic context,                    contained within what appear to be a series of hut floors and are               now the oldest known pottery recovered from good stratigraphic                  context in the New World.  Mr. Oyuela-Caycedo will return to San                Jacinto 1 with a team of workmen.  They will uncover an area of                 ca. 64-100 square meters and excavate it to the base of the                     archaeological deposit.  Materials recovered will permit degree                 of sedentism to be determined.  Because of excellent preservation               of floral and faunal remains, exploited resources will be                       identified and their contribution to the diet ascertained.  The                 use of space at the site will also be reconstructed.                            Characterization of soils and grain size distribution will                      provide information on the processes of site formation and on the               reconstruction of the depositional environment as well as post-                 depositional alteration. Pottery and lithics will also be                       analyzed.                                                                                                                                                       The site of San Jacinto 1 is important for several reasons.                     First, the early date of the pottery is of significance for the                 light it may shed on the sequence of cultural development in the                New World.  Given the generally poor preservation of faunal and                 floral remains, relatively little excavation has taken place in                 such tropical regions as Columbia.  Because these archaeological                materials appear to be in association with house structures, it                 will be possible to examine the interrelationship among such                    variables as the domestication of plants, invention of pottery                  and the emergence of a sedentary way of life.  While                            archaeologists know that these factors are related, it is unclear               how in the development of complex societies these interact and                  which come first.  Mr. Oyuela-Caycedo has found other sites from                the same time period in the region and the study of San Jacinto 1               in this broader context should shed new light on this underlying                cultural complex.                                                                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons.  The appearance                 of a settled way of life marked a major transition in the                       development of human culture and work at San Jacinto 1 should                   improve our understanding of this process.  It will provide data                of interest to a number of archaeologists and will contribute to                the training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
