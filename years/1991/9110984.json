 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motivated by the observation that most existing results                         on adaptive control are qualitative in nature and                               address only asymptotic performance (such as stability                          and robustness), the main focus of the proposed project                         is to develop constructive design approaches for                                adaptive systems which take into account both the                               transient response and the steady-state response.                               A standard adaptive control system is designed by                               incorporating an identification scheme into the control                         system and replacing the unknown parameters with                                their estimates.  Such design methodology is referred to                        as the \"certainty equivalence principle\"(CEP) in                                adaptive literature.  It does not guarantee good                                transient performance of the resulting system since it                          passes on the error of identification to the design stage.                      In this project, we will redesign adaptive control                              systems to overcome the inherent constraint due to                              CEP design, and thus improve performance.  A new                                design technique -- modeling error compensation                                 (MEC) -- is proposed to achieve this goal.  To                                  accommodate the error due to misidentification and                              CEP design, we will use the information about the                               quality of the identification to introduce an additional                        control signal on top of the CEP design.  This strategy                         provides a compensation mechanism that cannot be                                obtained via CEP design -- it compensates the effects                           of misidentification.  We propose to study both                                 theoretical and design aspects of the proposed adaptive                         scheme.  We will also study the application of MEC to                           a class of nonadaptive designs, to find answers for the                         question whether and when an adaptive system will                               outperform a nonadaptive system.",
