 "awd_abstract_narration": "A supercompiler is a program transformer of a certain type.  It traces          the possible generalized histories of computation by the original               program, and compiles an equivalent program, reducing in the process            the redundancy that could be present in the original program.  This             may lead to a deep restructuring of the program and a great increase            in its efficiency.  A single supercompiler program can serve as a               powerful partial evaluator; as a converter of multi-pass scanning               algorithms into one-pass algorithms; as a means of program                      verification and theorem proving.                                               The underlying language used is Refal.  The tracing of computation              histories is done by operations over the graph of states and                    transitions of the abstract Refal machine.  The states are                      configurations of the Refal machine.  In the current supercompiler a            configuration is a combination of nested function calls with the                values of free variables restricted by a Refal equivalent of certain            inequalities.  These restrictions are, however, nonrecursive.  This             work will upgrade the system so as to allow arbitrary recursive                 predicates as restrictions on configuration variables.  The                     supercompiler so improved will be then used for a wide range of                 practical and theoretical problems, such as partial evaluation,                 automatic construction of compilers, functional inversion, and theorem          proving.",
