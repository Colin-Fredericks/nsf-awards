 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) of San Jose State                   University will receive support for shipboard technician                        activities associated with the R/V POINT SUR, a 135-foot                        research vessel that is owned by the NSF and operated by the                    University.  A significant portion of the ship's operating                      schedule in recent years and again in 1991 is in support of                     NSF-sponsored research projects.  The Shipboard Technician                      Program has two components: an at-sea component and an ashore                   component.                                                                                                                                                      The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                         personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;                             maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific                              instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck                            operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming                     and off-going scientific parties.  On shore activities                          include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared                      use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in                    preparing for field work on the vessel.  Shipboard                              technicians funded by this award have broad responsibilities                    for providing the coordination and assistance needed for the                    successful completion of research projects at sea.  The level                   of activity and amount of support are closely related to the                    size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                    and capability.",
