 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are several species of weakly electric fishes that                        produce small repetitive discharges from their electric organs,                 and assess objects in their environment by monitoring distortions               of the electric field that they produce.  Studies of the                        physiology and behavior of these electrosensory systems have                    revealed principles of neuronal coding and processing of                        information which also characterize systems such as vision and                  audition in other vertebrates.                                                                                                                                  This work concentrates on groups of nerve cells, called                         nuclei, in a central region of the brain called the diencephalon,               which lies just in front of the midbrain region.  Studies have                  already shown that the diencephalic nuclei, unlike those in the                 midbrain, contain neurons dedicated to the generation of specific               behaviors by the whole fish in using its electric organ                         discharge.  This study will investigate the structure, function,                and interconnections of these neurons from different nuclei using               a variety of physiological and anatomical tracing techniques.                   Behaviorally relevant stimulus paradigms will be used to test the               response properties of individual neurons along pathways involved               in control of specific behavioral responses.  This fruitful model               system will generate results important to a range of sensory                    sciences, to behavior, and to computational neuroscience.",
