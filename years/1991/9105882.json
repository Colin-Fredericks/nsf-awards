 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even though everyone has planted dry seeds in their garden, or                  observed the germination of fungal spores in bread-making, very                 little is known about how dry biological systems like seeds and                 spores survive.  Recent work shows that sugars provide protection               for membranes as they are dried.  Sugars are abundant in dry seeds              and spores.  An additional aspect of the protection of dry systems              is the possibility of vitrification--the cytoplasm becomes a highly             viscous liquid.  This project will establish the extent to which                vitrification contributes to survival desiccation in a variety of               organisms.  Model experiments show that complex proteins and                    membrane/enzyme complexes can be preserved in the dry state by                  providing \"vitrifying sugars\" before drying.  These studies may                 lead to methods of preserving genetic products. //",
