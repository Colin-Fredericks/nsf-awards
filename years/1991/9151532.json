 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is enabling the Physics Department at Austin                       College to place significant emphasis on laser physics and                      other modern optics topics in a new course, Modern Optics.                      This course was created in a recent evaluation and revision of                  the physics curriculum at the College.  Major equipment being                   purchased include an optical spectrum analyzer to study the                     longitudinal mode structure of lasers, laser systems                            (constructed locally) with helium-neon discharge tubes and,                     external optical cavities to study cavity stability and                         transverse mode structures, and an acousto-optic cell with                      driver to be used for communications (over a laser beam or                      through an optical fiber) experiments and speed of light                        measurements.   A sophisticated computer system with powerful                   software for data acquisition and analysis is being purchased                   which will allow building on students' experience with other                    simpler computer systems.   This system allows students who are                 not expert programmers to build \"virtual instruments\" which                     perform specialized tasks such as recording diffraction                         patterns using a linear CCD sensor.   A group of lasers,                        optical breadboards, and additional optical components, e.g.,                   a variable beamsplitter, are being acquired to carry out these                  and other experiments.   These studies are being conducted in                   a specific course, but simplified versions of some experiments                  are being used in lower level courses, and the equipment is                     also available for upper level physics students doing                           independent work.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds                   from non-federal sources.",
