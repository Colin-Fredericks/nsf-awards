 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      David S. Chapman of the University of Utah and Dr. R. Allis                     of the Geophysics Division of the New Zealand Department of                     Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). The New Zealand                      Taranaki Basin is an important global example of an evolving                    rift basin, yet the thermal history of the basin is relatively                  unknown. This research is to develop a thermal history of the                   Taranaki Basin using recently-developed techniques which                        combine detailed thermal history modeling with quantitative                     kinetic models of hydrocarbon generation.  The thermal                          history will be based on bottom-hole temperature, thermal                       conductivity measurements, and burial history data from                         petroleum exploration drillholes. Kinetic theories of oil/gas                   generation will be used to predict hydrocarbon generation.                      the thermal history generated should result in answering                        significant questions about the timing of hydrocarbon                           generation relative to the structural evolution of the                          Taranaki and other rift basins.                                                                                                                                 The project represents excellent collaboration between the                      New Zealand group with its expertise in thermal processes and                   geothermal systems, in particular, in the Taranaki Basin and                    the U.S. expertise in combining kinetic models of hydrocarbon                   generation with thermal history modeling. This is important                     fundamental work in advancing techniques of basin analysis,                     as well as having potential for aiding exploration for                          hydrocarbons.",
