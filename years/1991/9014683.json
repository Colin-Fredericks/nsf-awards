In the low temperature phase the                                         compounds have nonlinear electrical                                             response at low electric fields due to                                          formation of charge density waves.                                              Recently, it has been discovered that                                           a novel type of non-linearity appears                                           in these compounds around liquid                                                helium temperatures.  The change                                                in the differential resistance is very                                          abrupt and large, and it would                                                  appear to offer excellent mixing                                                characteristics for low intensity                                               electromagnetic waves.                                                          The principal investigators will                                                attempt to use the sharp nonlinearity                                           of the electrical response for the                                              detection of microwave signals in the                                           frequency range of 10GHz to                                                     100GHz.  They will explore the                                                  properties of the compounds in the                                              presence of combined DC and                                                     microwave electric fields.  If                                                  microwave detection proves to be                                                feasible, they will compare the                                                 characteristics of these compounds                                              to that of established microwave                                                detectors.",
