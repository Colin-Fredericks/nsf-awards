 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is on perceptually lossless or very low              distortion, low-rate image coders using subband vector quantization             and models of the human visual system (HVS).  The use of visual                 models in the image coders attempts to remove the psychophysical                redundancies present in the images in addition to the statistical               redundancies that most image coders attempt to remove.  Two                     different strategies that make use of the current knowledge of the              HVS are being employed in the data compression systems:  (1)                    Quantize the intensity image after processing it with a homomorphic             visual model.  The idea behind this approach is that the intensity              image, when processed with the visual model, will look more like                the image that the \"eye sees\" and therefore minimizing the                      distortion in the transformed image is appropriate.  (2) The second             approach is to define a masking function for the image to be                    quantized.  This function defines threshold values for each pixel               of the image such that distortions of magnitude smaller than the                threshold function will not be perceived by the eye.  The approach              then is to develop a data compression system such that the                      quantization produces errors of magnitude smaller than this                     threshold function.  The specific problems that are being studied               are: (1) Development of a subband vector quantizer that is equipped             with a multichannel, homomorphic model of the HVS.  (2) Development             of a subband vector quantizer that used a perceptual masking                    function.  A combination of the two schemes, as well as                         incorporation of predictive vector quantization and/or optimum pre-              post-processing filters into the subband coder is being explored.              Preliminary work on extending the ideas to color image sequence                 coding problems are also being conducted.",
