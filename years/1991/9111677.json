 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are:  (A) Development of lower-cost              techniques for concurrent detection of program execution errors                 caused by processor hardware faults, (B) development of lower-cost              techniques for tolerating errors caused by transient faults, (C)                development of theory that sets optimal bounds on the effectiveness             of such techniques, and (D) development of analytical and                       experimental methods for evaluating the techniques against the                  theoretical bounds.  New techniques are developed using a behavior-             based-error-detection paradigm, in which a simple error-detection               coprocessor monitors a program for deviations from a compiler-                  formed abstraction of its behavior.  Existing low-cost behavior-                based techniques exploit certain redundancies in program codes or               in a processor's architecture.  New techniques are also developed               by using the methods from information theory, coding theory, and                graph theory to identify new redundancies to exploit, and by using              experimental data to uncover gaps between existing techniques and               theoretical bounds.  Concurrent error detection is necessary                    because transient faults are becoming more frequent as device size              decreases, as the number of devices per processor and the number                of processors per computer grows, and as more computers are                     subjected to noisy environments.  The proposed work is important                because, although computer dependability is increasingly important,             existing concurrent-error-detection methods are too costly for all              but a few applications.",
