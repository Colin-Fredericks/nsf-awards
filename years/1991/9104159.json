 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a leaf develops it is converted from a net user of carbohydrate              to a net exporter.  This event influences patterns of growth and                productivity.  The transfer of sugars form leaf to phloem is called             phloem loading.  The accepted model for this process is that                    surcose is transferred across cell membranes by selective carriers.             An alternative mechanism is proposed in which sucrose passes from               cell to cell to the phloem through plasmodesmata, tiny protoplasmic             connections that provide cytoplasmic continuity between cells.  In              the  phloem, the smaller sucrose molecules are converted to larger              sugar molecule that cannot pass back through the plasmodesmata.                 The sugar is thus trapped in the phloem cells.  The morphology and              dimensions of plasmodesmata will be studied along with the enzymes              involved in converting sucrose into larger sugars.//",
