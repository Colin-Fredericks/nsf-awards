 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paradigm Development Group Ltd. is developing a software                   package for individual decision support that provides an                        integrative graphical model, which is initially expanded                        (problem structuring) and then contracted (analytical                           structuring) prior to analysis via quantitative models.  This                   process can be characterized as having three phases:                            divergence, convergence, and analysis.  These phases may be                     repeated iteratively or may be stopped early, depending on                      the needs of the user.  This software uses graphical models                     to move the user through the structuring and analysis phases.                   Problem structuring is a combination of text-based queries                      and the construction of a cognitive map, a directed graph.                      The software will then aid the user in reducing the                             cognitive map to an analytically tractable influence diagram                    during the analytical structuring (convergence) phase.                          Analytical support for elicitation, sensitivity analysis and                    interpretation will be provided during the last phase.                               This research focuses on the convergence phase.  The                       divergence and analytical phases are well understood and have                   been automated.  The ability to do the convergence phase well                   is the primary distinction between professional and novice                      analysts, and has not been examined systematically in the                       literature.  This research will identify, classify and test                     sufficient convergence techniques to aid the user in                            winnowing a large cognitive map down to a reasonably sized                      influence diagram for analysis.  The results will form the                      basis for future empirical work on the usefulness of the                        techniques for real decision makers.  The same research area                    is a great concern to Group Decision Support System                             developers.  The research will lead to commercial decision                      support software and techniques that can be used in a wide                      range of research and development for decision aiding                           systems.",
