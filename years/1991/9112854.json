 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal introduces several new decision analysis techniques for           stochastic models (that is, probabilistic models in which uncertainty           unfolds over time).  These techniques cam fruitfully be applied to              medical decisions in which tradeoffs must be made between immediate and         temporally distant risks.  Two of these techniques, stochastic trees and        stochastic factoring, are model display approaches that have significant        advantages over current technique in medical decision modelling with            regard to:                                                                         (a) formulation of the stochastic model by the analyst,                         (b) presentation and display of the stochastic model to the medical          practitioner, and                                                                  (c) computational friendliness.                                              Like more familiar decision trees, stochastic trees may be rolled back          to determine the optimal treatment decision.  These techniques should           make stochastic modelling more understandable for the decision analyst          and the medical practitioner.  The third technique, risk-sensitive              stochastic trees, draws on newly developed results from preference              theory and has significant advantages over other risk-preference models         with regard to ease in modelling a patient's temporal risk-taking               preferences.  Using these techniques, the impact of risk-averse                 preferences on medical treatment will be examined, and the utility of           these methods will be demonstrated with respect to the long-term                treatment of mild gout and decisions to undergo total hip replacement.",
