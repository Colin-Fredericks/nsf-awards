Silicon carbide particle synthesis                                              will be studied as a model of                                                   systems which involve chemical                                                  nucleation of microcrystals.  The                                               experimental apparatus will consist                                             of a thermal plasma reactor into                                                which reactants are injected and                                                then expanded through a converging                                              nozzle.  Particles will nucleate in                                             the nozzle, and then will exit to a                                             free expansion so that coagulation                                              is suppressed.  The advantages of                                               this approach are that (1) the                                                  process is capable of generating                                                nanosize particles with narrow size                                             distributions; (2) the nozzle flow                                              environment can be                                                              well-characterized; (3) key process                                             variables such as cooling rates can                                             be controlled; and (4) the                                                      processcan be scaled for high-rate                                              industrial production.  A                                                       hypersonicimpactor located                                                      immediately downstream of the nozzle                                            will be used to collect particles as                                            small as 5 nm.  Particles will be                                               characterized by techniques such as                                             scanning tunneling microscopy and                                               high resolution transmission                                                    electron microscopy.  A theoretical                                             model will be developed which                                                   corresponds to the experimental                                                 conditions, and which combines                                                  first-principles molecular dynamics                                             calculations of cluster properties                                              with a dynamic model for particle                                               nucleation and growth.  The                                                     knowledge and technology base will                                              be develop for nanoparticle                                                     synthesis in a plasma reaction, with                                            a broad range of applications for                                               advanced materials.",
