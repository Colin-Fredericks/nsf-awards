 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior results from this laboratory have shown that elicitors of a               plant's defense response bind to receptors on the plant cell                    surface and within 0-8 minutes stimulate a burst of hydrogen                    peroxide.  This sudden production of hydrogen peroxide serves not               only to destroy certain pathogenic compounds but may also                       stiimulate subsequent phytoalexin production.  The next goals of                this research are to characterize the oxidative burst, determine                its role in triggering phytoalexin biosynthesis, evaluate whether               other defense compounds are induced by the oxidative burst, and                 identify the enzymes and substrates involved in its synthesis.                  Recent results also indicate that the elicitor molecule is                      internalized via endocytosis following association with its                     receptor on the plant cell surface.  In further experiments, the                kinetics of internalization of the receptor will be examined, and               its path will be monitored as it moves from the cell surface to                 its final intracellular destination .  Whether receptors for                    different elicitors follow identical pathways will also be                      evaluated.  Finally, it has been found that plant cells have                    receptors for biotin and that macromolecules can be delivered                   into a living plant cell via biotin receptor-mediated endocytosis               if the macromolecules are first covalently derivatized with                     biotin.  The use of this pathway to deliver enzymes, nucleic                    acids, toxins and antibodies, etc into living plant cells will be               explored.                                                                                                                                                       Just as higher animals have well developed immune responses to                  defend against pathogens, higher plants also have defense                       responses that allow them to resist invasion and damage.  The                   mechanisms by which plant defense responses are regulated is a                  very important fundamental problem about which, thus far, little                is known.  With prior NSF support, Drs. Low and Heinstein                       discovered that exposure of soybean cells to a chemical trigger                 (\"elicitor\") of a defense response is followed very quickly by                  production of hydrogen peroxide by the plant cells.  The further                goals of this research are to clarify the role of hydrogen                      peroxide in the defense response, and to pursue other leads                     concerning the sequence of events between exposure of a plant to                a potential pathogen and the production by the plant of                         protective chemicals.  The results of this project should                       contribute to our understanding of the cellular signaling                       mechanisms that regulate plant defense responses.",
