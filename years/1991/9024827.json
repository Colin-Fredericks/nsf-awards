 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heating and modification of the ionosphere by powerful HF                  heaters have been recognized to be a powerful means to study the                nonlinear plasma  physics and to understand the internal dynamics               of the ionosphere.  The proposed program is aimed at developing                 theories for better understanding of the experimental                           observations with particular reference to: (a) height difference                between HFPLs and natural lines and the correlation between                     HFPLs and field-aligned irregularities; (b) frequency upshifted                 HFPLs and their organization altitude; (c) plasma lines overshoot               and expansion of originating altitude interval of HFPLs; and  (d)               generation of electron Bernstein modes as the source waves of                   secondary simulated EM emission.  New experiments will be                       initiated whenever they are feasible.  The approach will be based               on our earlier and recent works that include the study of thermal               flamentation instability of field-aligned Langmuir wave,                        evolution of HFPLs and the study of various parametric                          instability processes.  We also propose to study the effects of                 the ionospheric plasma inhomogeneity on the results of HF heating               experiments.   ***",
