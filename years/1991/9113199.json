 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal goal in this project is to elucidate the                          mechanism in microbes whereby iron is released from its                         extremely stable carrier at the appropriate time and location.                  Model experiments which use micelles designed to probe possible                 effects of the aqueous/cell interface on the labilization of                    iron from siderophores and other polydentate chelators will be                  performed.  The influence of the aqueous/micelle interface on                   the kinetics of iron/ligand exchange between, for example, the                  hydrophilic siderophore ferrioxamine B and a micelle bound                      hydrophobic chelator, benzohydroxamic acid, will be tested.                     Phenanthroline will also be incorporated into the micelle in                    some experiments, as preliminary data show that phenanthroline                  accelerates iron/ligand exchange into the micellar pseudo-phase                 via a redox mechanism.  Supramolecular assemblies in aqueous                    solution will be investigated in order to evaluate second                       coordination shell effects on iron(III)-ligand dissociation                     kinetics.  Hydrophobic crown ethers may permit these supra-                     molecular assemblies to form on micelle \"surfaces\".  These                      assemblies may be used as models for cell surface receptor                      complexes.  The kinetics of ligand exchange within these supra-                 molecular assemblies (e.g., ferrioxamine B-crown ether-                         surfactant) and the influence that ternary complex formation                    has on these kinetics will be measured.                                         %%%                                                                             In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                     metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Alvin L.                        Crumbliss of Duke University will model the way in which iron                   is released in microbes at the appropriate time and location.                   Bacteria contain molecules which bind and transport iron so                     efficiently that some are used as drugs in chelation therapy.                   The results of these bioinorganic experiments will enhance our                  understanding of microbial iron transport mechanisms and                        mechanisms related to metal extraction processes.",
