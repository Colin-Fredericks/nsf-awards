 "awd_abstract_narration": "The black swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes) exhibits a                       hilltopping lek mating system.  Lek behavior occurs where males                 cannot economically defend either females or resources important                to females.  Males that are more successful in male-male                        competition or possessing unique qualities attractive to females                often do most of the mating.  Since females gain nothing but                    gametes from lek males, leks provide an excellent opportunity to                test questions relating to male intrasexual selection and female                choice.  Choosy females may gain by producing offspring that                    survive and mature better than those of less selective females.                 Also, choosy females may produce sons that are more successful in               male-male competition or are more preferred by selective females.               However, whether females actually gain reproductively through                   their mate choice in lek-mating species remains largely                         hypothetical.                                                                        Using descriptive and experimental techniques, Lederhouse                  and Scriber will investigate the importance of female                           intersexual selection (mate choice) and of male-male intrasexual                selection (competition) in determining reproductive success in P.               polyxenes.  They will determine physical and possible genetic                   correlates of aggressive territorial males with male mating                     success.  The nature and degree of female choice will be                        determined.  The maturation and survival of their offspring and                 the ability of sons to gain and  maintain territories and court                 females will be compared.  The investigators will also test if                  male reproductive success is correlated to specific genetic                     profiles.  Results of this research will improve understanding of               the evolution of leks by testing several alternative views.",
