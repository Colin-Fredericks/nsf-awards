 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School of Oceanography of the University of Washington                      will acquire a sea-going data management system and items of                    oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of                         shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for use                     on or in association with the research vessels operated by                      the University.  The University will take delivery of its new                   research vessel THOMAS THOMPSON during 1991 and this                            instrumentation will provide some of the basic scientific                       capability necessary to support NSF-sponsored research                          projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the                           capabilities of the institution to support research and                         engineering activities.  The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                          -DECstation 5000 computer system and components for real-time                    acquisition, management, analysis, and display of large                         environmental and geophysical data sets,                                       -Climate control room outfitting to better assure data                           quality from samples collected at sea,                                         -CTD sensors, pressure gauges, and other enhancements for                        obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and                        temperature as a function of depth,                                            -Scintillation counter for measurements of radio-isotope                          tracers and other chemical parameters,                                        -fume hood for removing chemical fumes from the ship's                           laboratory                                                                     -XBT system for obtaining temperature profiles in the ocean                      without having to stop the ship, and                                           -Replacement autoclaves for sterilizing glassware and other                      tools and for preparing chemical reagents used in                               experiments.  These will be for use ashore by all members of                    the School of Oceanography.                                                                                                                                    The University of Washington is cost sharing in the                             acquisition of this equipment.  The instrumentation described                   above will increase the capability of the University to                         support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.",
