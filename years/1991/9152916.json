 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to strengthen the Experimental                       component of the Psychology curriculum through development of                   a computer-based Experimental Psychology laboratory.  Students                  in the laboratory will learn the concepts of Experimental                       Psychology while becoming familiar with the computer hardware,                  software and related peripherals.  They will become acquainted                  with the modern data acquisition, transmission, analysis and                    stimulus control techniques they are likely to encounter in                     graduate school and in the work place.  Actual experimentation                  will replace demonstrations and simulations, and student-                       initiated research will replace prepackaged laboratory                          activities.To achieve this goal, fifteen (15) IBM PS/2 Model                    55SX machines are net-worked with an IBM Model 80 file server.                  Work stations are interfaced using a Keithley 575 system with                   various response acquisition and stimulus generation devices.                   Two-way audio and one-way video communication are also provided                 to and among stations to allow \"live\" behavioral interaction                    and analysis.",
