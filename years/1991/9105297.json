 "awd_abstract_narration": "The impact explanation for the Cretaceous-Tertiary (KT)                    boundary mass extinction has received much support and                          confirmation, although it continues to be challenged.  As part of               the ongoing study of this problem by many scientists worldwide, two             lines of investigation are proposed:  (1) detailed stratigraphic                study of the sequence of events during the boundary crisis, and (2)             search for an impact crater on oceanic crust by studying possible               tsunami effects on continental slopes and margins.                                   (1) The stratigraphic study will use numerous Apennine KT                  boundary sections deposited near the CCD, which are sensitive to                paleoceanographic changes.  Recent work shows that abnormal                     reducing and corrosive conditions resulted from the KT event in                 this environment, and the character and duration of these events,               and their relation to fluctuations in the iridium profile and the               occurrence of impact signatures will be examined.                                    (2) Recent work by others strongly suggests impact in the                  Southern U.S. -Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico area.  Work on sections                 proximal to the impact site will yield detailed understanding of                the impact event.",
