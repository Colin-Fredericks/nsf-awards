 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of utilizing nonlinear models for                                control systems design has become more prevalent as                             systems become complex, and simplifying linear model                            assumptions are inadequate for purposes of control.                             An inherent problem in using nonlinear models is that                           properties such as stability are not so easily                                  characterized.  Even more difficult is the question of                          stabilizability of nonlinear systems.  Here an                                  investigation of the problem of local smooth                                    stabilization of smooth continuous time nonlinear                               systems is proposed.  The main objective of the                                 proposed research is to obtain a general theory which                           may apply toward the local smooth stabilization (or                             testing the local smooth stabilizability) of all smooth                         nonlinear systems.  This research will culminate in the                         construction of algorithms which will systematically                            attack the stabilization problem, depending on the                              structure of the system involved.  Further extensions of                        this research could involve the use of these algorithms                         in adaptive control of smooth nonlinear systems.                                The main tools involved will be the construction of                             Lyapunov functions which test the local smooth                                  stabilizability of smooth nonlinear systems through the                         use of multivariate power series and the blow-up                                method of bifurcation analysis.                                                 This research will make a significant contribution to the                       theory of local stability and stabilizability of nonlinear                      systems.  The impact of this research will be far                               reaching for applications for applications of control of                        nonlinear systems.  Examples of potential applications                          of this theory can be found in control of mechanical                            systems such as aircraft or robotic applications.",
