 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of two parts.  The first involves the                     extension of previous research on the foundations of monetary                   economics.  This research will formally address the issues of how               exchange takes place and which objects come to play the role of                 money, or a medium of exchange.  Much progress has been made                    towards understanding the development of both commodity and fiat                money in abstract economic models.  Further work includes the                   resolution of some technical issues concerning the theoretical                  models and even, more importantly, the development of simplified                versions of the framework that can be used to address substantive               issues, including policy issues in monetary economics.   The second             part of the study is to investigate some implications of explicitly             incorporating a household production sector in models of                        macroeconomic activity.  Some preliminary analysis indicates                    household production can have an important qualitative and                      quantitative impact in an otherwise standard model of the business              cycle.  Future work includes the analysis of these business cycle               implications, and the investigation of the impact of household                  production in theories of unemployment, economic growth, and public             finance.",
