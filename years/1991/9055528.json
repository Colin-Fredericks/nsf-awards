These                   courses are the third phase of MMSEC's 3-year comprehensive                     training of elementary teachers in mathematics and science                      content and teaching methodology.  When completed these                         courses will offer teacher university -level content courses                    in science and mathematics which will support earlier                           activities of academic year inservice workshops and summer                      trainers' institutes.  These earlier programs provided                          teachers with strong, creative teaching methods based on                        hands-on inquiry learning and contextual knowledge and                          understanding needed to improve the deficient performance and                   classroom achievements of minority children.  The eight Texas                   sites for this project --San Antonio, Ft. Worth, Arlington,                     Dallas, Nacogdoches, Beaumont/Port Arthur, Edinburg, and                        Laredo-- and the eight institutions of higher education --                      Stephen Austin State University, Texas Christian University,                    University of Texas at San Antonio, Lamar University,                           University of Texas at Pan American, Laredo State University,                   University of Texas at Dallas, and Tarrant County Junior                        College -- along with the support of the Texas Higher                           Education Coordinating Board form a powerful partnership to                     improve the teaching of mathematics and science in                              predominantly minority schools.  It is estimated that through                   this partnership 536 teachers will be educated and over 10,616                  students will be reached indirectly.",
