 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insulin is one of the most important regulators of biological                   functions.  However, our present knowledge on the mechanisms of                 action of insulin is very limited.  Insulin interacts with cells                by binding to a specific surface receptor and, upon binding,                    generates specific biochemical signals that control various                     metabolic processes that occur inside the cell. One of the various              signals used by insulin is the generation of small chemical                     mediators.  These mediators are complex sugars that act by                      regulating a number of biochemical functions that determine the                 metabolism of glucose, fat and other cellular components.                                                                                                       However, the mechanisms by which insulin regulates the generation               of these mediators are not understood.  Members of a family of                  regulatory proteins (G proteins) are involved in the generation of              insulin mediators.  It is not clear, however, how the insulin                   receptor communicates with these proteins.  Several alternative                 hypotheses exist.  For instance, upon binding of insulin, the                   receptor becomes activated and may change the structure of other                proteins by attaching phosphate groups in specific sites located                in the target protein.  Alternatively, the activated receptor may               interact directly with these regulatory proteins, modifying them                transitorily and inducing their activation without generating any               long term chemical changes in the protein.  These and other                     possibilities will be examined by taking advantage of several types             of modified insulin receptors generated by recombinant DNA                      technology in which specific functions have been impaired.                                                                                                      It is possible that the major defects associated with the                       resistance of Type 2 diabetics to insulin may be related to the                 mechanisms by which insulin transmits signals to the interior of                the cell.  This proposal addresses directly some important                      questions on the biochemical events that lead to the generation of              insulin mediators and the work proposed here should increase our                understanding of the molecular defects that lead to the diabetic                state.//",
