 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workers in eusocial Hymenoptera colonies (relatedness asymmetry                 present) are  predicted to favor a more female-biased sex-ratio as              compared to the sex-ratio favored by workers in parasocial                      colonies (relatedness asymmetry absent).                                                                                                                        Experiments on the primitively eusocial sweat bee Augochlorella                 striata, with random assignment of colonies to a eusocial and                   parasocial condition confirmed the predicted female-bias in                     eusocial colonies, but were unable to test the hypothesis that                  worker reproduction of males is greater in parasocial than in                   eusocial colonies.  The determination of maternity of males by                  means of a genetic analysis is essential to test this hypothesis.                                                                                               This study will involve genetically fingerprinting reproductives,               workers, and male sexuals of the experimental nests in order to                 compare worker reproduction of males in eusocial and parasocial                 colonies.  Because of parthenogenetic production of males, all                  bands in a fingerprint of a male must also be present in the                    fingerprint of his mother.  Maternity of males can therefore be                 determined by matching fingerprints of males to fingerprints of                 putative mothers (e.g. foundresses and workers).  If evidence                   from genetic fingerprinting refutes the hypothesis of worker                    reproduction, relatedness asymmetries deriving from haplodiploidy               remain as the only explanation of the observed sex-ratio                        adjustments.  This would imply that social behavior in A. striata               evolved not only in response to ecological constraints limiting                 reproductive options, but also in relation to genetic variables                 (relatedness asymmetries) intrinsic to the haplodiploid system of               sex-determination.",
