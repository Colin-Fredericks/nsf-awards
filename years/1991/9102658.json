 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biogeochemical cycles of antimony, arsenic, and selenium in                 the marine environment are complex, and include processes such                  as oxidation-reduction reactions, selective biological uptake,                  and kinetic controls on their chemical speciation.  However,                    the potential toxicity of several metalloid species and the                     anthropogenic mobilization of these elements by fossil fuel                     combustion, are compelling reasons to fully understand the                      cycling of metalloid in the ocean.  Of the three elements, very                 few data are available on antimony speciation and distributions                 in the open ocean.  Selenium and arsenic have been extensively                  examined in the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but several                  aspects of their cycling remain to be elucidated.  This                         research utilizes samples collected from vertical profiles and                  horizontal transects in the North and South Atlantic, and                       eastern tropical North Pacific.  Selective hydride generation                   methods will be used to analyze the samples, and the data will                  be augmented by nutrient and trace element results from other                   researchers working at the same stations.  The primary                          objectives of this research will be:  (1) to quantitatively                     describe the marine biogeochemical cycle of antimony; (2) to                    establish whether refractory organic arsenic compounds that                     have been found in coastal waters are present in oligotrophic                   waters, and if so, their role in the arsenic cycle; (3) to                      evaluate whether the chemical speciation of arsenic and                         antimony responds to suboxic conditions in the water column;                    and (4) to determine the fraction of dissolved selenium which                   is bound in soluble peptides and proteins.",
