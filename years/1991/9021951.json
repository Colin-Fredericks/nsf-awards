 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the role of                          immigration, commodity trade and capital markets on the evolution               of an international labor market linking Europe and the New World               over the century following 1870.  Rather than pursuing the                      traditional focus on the migrations themselves, the project will                focus instead on wages and employment in sending and receiving                  regions, identifying episodes of labor market integration and                   disintegration as well as isolating the causes for these changes.               Special attention will be given to the role of environmental                    factors leading to labor force migration such as the Irish potato               famine and the environmental decay experienced by urban centers                 during the industrial revolution.   The project will also explore               the role of migration in distributing the incidence of                          unemployment in response to global output shocks, including                     identifying country experience with wage flexibility and                        stickiness, and how that experience is related to international                 migrations and the attributes of sectors which dominate sending                 and receiving regions.  The project will also search for an                     endogenous explanation for the timing and location of quotas,                   subsidies, and other policy interventions.  This research is                    important because it will enhance our understanding of the                      dynamics of labor migration and the impact of environmental                     change on migration.",
