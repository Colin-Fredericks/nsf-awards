 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to describe the effect of                ions on the segmental and local motions of polymers in the presence             and absence of low-molecular-weight solvent molecules.  The                     polymers and salts of interest are those that exhibit high ionic                conduction such as poly(ethylene oxide) and lithium perchlorate.                Multifield, multinuclear, and variable temperature nuclear spin                 lattice relaxation experiments will be performed on different                   polymer/salt systems.  The resulting T1 data will be analyzed using             dynamic models for the segmental and local motions of the polymer.              The relationship between polymer motion and ionic conduction will               be investigated by this technique.                                                                                                                                   Segmental motion of the polymer contributes to high ionic                  conduction in polymer/salt systems according to dynamic bond                    percolation theory;.  The interaction between certain polymers and              salts is an example of the importance of site-specific interactions             in determining the properties of polymer-based materials.  This                 study investigates site-specific interactions by a dynamic rather               than static approach to reveal the impact of these interactions.                Ultimately, the results of this research will provide the basis for             a comprehensive analysis of the present state of theory and                     encourage further theoretical development.",
