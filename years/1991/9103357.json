 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program deals with understanding of the                           mechanisms of crystallization of molecular sieve zeolite in                     hydrothermal systems.  Taking advantage of seeding techniques                   in zeolite syntheses results in somewhat larger particles, as                   expected and desired, but the degree of success has been                        limited, and the seed crystals themselves are converted into                    polycrystalline masses with quite irregular morphology.  This                   ongoing project continues the zeolite synthesis research to                     investigate the effects of seeding zeolite crystallization                      systems, and to study the effects on the seed crystals                          themselves.  While circumstantial evidence that initial                         breeding occurs in the seeded silicalite synthesis system has                   been obtained, an attempt to actually observe these by                          microscopic techniques is being made.  An attempt is also                       being made to demonstrate for several zeolite systems that                      some of these surface-bound initial bred nuclei remain on the                   seed crystal surface and generate the polycrystalline masses                    noted above.  Examination of these initial bred nuclei by                       scanning  and transmission electron microscope is attempted.                    An investigation of the effects that different growth                           environments have on the seed crystals themselves is done by                    these techniques and by selected area diffraction techniques.                   Crystals grown using the technique of late reagent addition                     during a crystallization also are investigated.  Lastly,                        zeolite crystal precipitate zeolite NaA and \"Silicalite\" are                    investigated.  The crystals have potential applications in                      sensors and in membrane separations.",
