Research internships offer each student a discipline-specific research          experience with a practicing scientist.  Research activities are                complemented by training in basic skills needed for actual research -           experimental design, statistics, using library collections, reading             scientific literature, scientific writing, and social and historical            contexts.                                                                                                                                                       Students will present the results of their research to their parents,           teachers from throughout the region, and university faculty during a            Scientific Conference that is designed to prepare them to continue the          research with the students in their high schools.",
