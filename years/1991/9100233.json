A                            significant portion of the ship's operating schedule in                         recent years and looking ahead are in support of NSF-                           sponsored research projects.  The Shipboard Technician                          Program has two components: an at-sea component and an ashore                   component.                                                                                                                                                      The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                         personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; mainten-                    ance, repair, and calibration of scientific instrumentation;                    instruction and supervision of deck operations; and providing                   logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going scientific                      parties.  On shore activities include the maintenance,                          repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and                    assisting scientific personnel in preparing for field work on                   the vessel.  Shipboard technicians funded by this award have                    broad responsibilities for providing the coordination and                       assistance needed for the successful completion of research                     projects at sea.  The level of activity and amount of support                   are closely related to the size and capability of the vessel,                   and its scientific outfit and capability.",
