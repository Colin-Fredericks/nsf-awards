Several of the                 proposed problems are concerned with the interplay between extreme              value theory, point process methods, asymptotic theory and                      applications of these ideas to time series analysis and choice                  theory.  In addition, the investigator will work on problems of                 random sets and multidimensional problems.                                           The principal investigator will continue his work in the                   general area of extreme values, both from the inference as well as              from the stochastic model point of view.  This area of research                 falls in the interface between statistics (inference) and                       probability (stochastic models).  One particular application of                 this work will be to time series analysis.",
