Specifically, this workshop will address recent evidence that                   high-temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO) techniques measure                  a major component of DOC in natural waters that is not                          quantified by conventional UV/persulfate (UV/PP methods.  The                   main goals of the workshop will be to:  (1) define consistent                   trends among DOC measurements by HTCO versus UV/P and other                     methods (based both on existing data and results for a small                    set of representative samples analyzed by workshop                              participants; (2) critically evaluate procedures for                            collecting, processing and preserving water samples for DOC                     analysis; (3) identify possible mechanisms for consistent                       differences in DOC measurements (as they relate both to                         handling and analytical methodology; and (4) recommend                          guidelines for future research on problems related to accurate                  DOC quantification as well as interim procedures for DOC                        measurements in ongoing field studies.  Considerations will                     also be given to that analogous measurement of dissolved                        organic nitrogen.",
