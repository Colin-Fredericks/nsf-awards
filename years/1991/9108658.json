 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, the Denver Museum of                  Natural History will curate its collection of native North                      American basketry.  This includes approximately 1,700 items made                by 92 native American tribes.  In the first step of a four part                 plan, documentation will be updated.  Records will be                           supplemented, descriptive data checked out and uniform                          information entered in catalogs.  This will improve the research                data and lay the groundwork for a computerized data base.                       Secondly, the museum conservator will survey conditions, perform                minor stabilization and produce a basketry conservation plan.  In               the third phase of the project, baskets will be rehoused with                   mounts and supports in new cabinets.  Inventorying, labeling, and               recording of storage locations will take place.  Finally, a                     summary guide to the collection, related records, research                      potential, policies and procedures will be published.                                                                                                           The collection constitutes a significant resource because of both               its breadth and its depth in specific areas.  It documents an                   almost 200 year period since some of the baskets were collected                 in the early 1800s.  Collecting has continued until recent times                and many of the items have detailed supporting documentation.  In               some cases, the names of the craftsmen are known.  From an                      anthropological perspective, the collection provides a strong                   data base to address a number of questions and not all of these                 concern basketry per se.  Through the study of such material                    objects, insight can be gained into the nature of culture contact               and culture change over time.                                                                                                                                   Because of the imperfect state of the documentation and storage                 the basketry collection is difficult to use and therefore not                   maximally available for scientific research.  This project should               remedy the situation.",
