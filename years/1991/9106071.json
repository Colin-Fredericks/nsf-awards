 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most studies of human coping strategies have been limited to               the responses of a population to cataclysmic events like                        droughts.  Equally important is the response of a population to                 gradual, human-induced degradation of the physical resource base                in an intrinsically verdant environment.  This doctoral                         dissertation project will examine agricultural responses of the                 population of the Highland prefecture of Gikongoro in Rwanda,                   which is experiencing serious declines in food production, to                   increasing population density.  It will identify and explain                    changes over time in land productivity as interpreted by farmers                and documented in the literature, and it will analyze the                       agricultural and non-agricultural responses to changes in land                  productivity.  National and Gikongoro surveys of changing views                 towards land productivity and agricultural practices, aerial                    photographs showing land uses in  1958, 1979, and 1990, data from               existing ministry surveys, and information from libraries and                   other sources will be use to assess relationships among a variety               of societal and environmental factors over time and space.                                                                                                           This project will contribute to geographical and social                    scientific understandings of strategies for coping with food                    deficits, and more broadly, with basic problems of food                         production in tropical Africa.  It also will test the validity of               using a political ecology framework for analyzing questions about               human-environment interactions.  This project also will provide                 an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to                       continue to develop independent research skills.",
