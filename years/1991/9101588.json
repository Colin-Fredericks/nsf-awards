 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is               in the general area of of analytical and surface chemistry.  It                 builds upon the successes realized during the conduct of the Phase              1 project.  The long range scientific goals of this research are                to develop methods of analysis of real world samples, to make                   improvements in the instrumentation, and to determine the limits                of instrument performance using well characterized test samples.                Neutron activation of elements produces radionuclides.                          Characteristic gamma-rays associated with the radionuclide                      disintegrations can be measured with germanium detectors.                       Secondary electrons produced at the surface of a thin sample as a               beta-particle exits the sample can be accelerated and imaged.                   When these gamma-rays and beta-particles are detected in                        coincidence, the gamma-ray answers the question \"what\" and the                  secondary electron answers the question \"where\" for an individual               radionuclide disintegration.  This information can be organized                 into element maps and local area gamma-rays spectra.                            %%%                                                                             This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project                  will continue the efforts initially started during the Phase 1                  project.  An important goal of the SBIR Program is the ultimate                 conversion of NSF-supported research into technological innovation              and commercial application.",
