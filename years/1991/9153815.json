 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this \"Student Watershed Research Project\" is                     to promote collaboration between science teachers and                           cooperating scientists to involve students in significant                       scientific research as an integral part of science                              instruction during the regular school day.  The 3-year                          program will develop and disseminate training,                                  instructional materials, and support enabling student                           collection, interpretation, and communication of scientific                     data in a local watershed.  Middle/high school teachers                         will participate in aquatic research, and  develop                              instructional plans to involve their students.  Reliable,                       replicable data collection procedures for use with students                     will be developed or adapted from existing sources and                          validated in cooperation with scientists from universities                      and government agencies.  Under the guidance of their                           teacher, students will collect and analyze physical,                            chemical, and biological data from a local watershed.                           Through a project-developed computer conferencing system,                       students will contribute their data to a regional data base                     and discuss their findings across school and municipal                          boundaries.  Teachers will receive information and support                      electronically to continue collaboration with peers and                         cooperating scientists.  Students will interact with the                        scientists for questions and discussion.  Student data will                     be contributed to public agencies and university research                       projects.  Teachers and students will present findings,                         discuss issues, and attend additional training workshops at                     a regional convention involving all project participants.                       Project-developed training, materials, and methodologies                        will be packaged for dissemination to any district                              interested in adopting the program.                                                                                                                             The project runs from September 1, 1991 to September 30,                        1994.  The cost sharing by the institution is 34% of the                        amount requested from NSF.",
