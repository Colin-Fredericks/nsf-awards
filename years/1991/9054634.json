 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute of Ecosystem Studies is requesting two year support to            enhance, test, produce and disseminate an ecology curriculum entitled           Eco-Inquiry.                                                                                                                                                    The foundation of this multi-dimensional, 8 to 15 week, 5th and 6th             grade curriculum has been built through four years of local development         and testing.  Eco-Inquiry has three distinctive features:  1) its               emphasis on the conceptual underpinnings of ecological literacy -               nutrient cycling and energy flow, 2) its commitment to demystifying the         practice of science and scientists, and 3) its approach to developing           students' inquiry skills and dispositions through modeling the                  scientific community in the classroom.  Eco-Inquiry uses a diversity of         teaching methods (e.g., collaborative learning, teaching for conceptual         change) to engage students in activities that are imaginative and highly        participatory.                                                                                                                                                  The Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) is a division of The New York          Botanical Garden, founded in 1983 to promote educational programs in            ecology.  IES field, laboratory and education facilities are at the Mary        Flagler Cary Arboretum in Millbrook, New York; additional field sites           are located throughout the northeastern United States and elsewhere.",
