 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important area of current astronomical research concerns the                 study of mass loss of red giant stars as they evolve to white                   dwarfs through the \"planetary nebula\" stage.  It is now believed                that this loss occurs as a wind of atomic particles.  The                       intensity of this wind increases over the course of several                     thousand years until the envelope of the star is peeled off in a                very fast wind at a rapid rate.  The Principal Investigator (PI)                proposes to continue previous studies of this phenomenon by using               a determining the amount of mass lost in this wind in a large                   sample of red giants from the strength of two carbon monoxide                   emission lines in the nebular material surrounding them.  The                   amounts of mass loss will be correlated against known stellar                   parameters such as stellar mass, luminosity, radius, and chemical               composition to permit an empirical model to be developed as to                  how mass is lost during this critical brief stage of evolution.",
