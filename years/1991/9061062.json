 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exfluor Research Corporation has recently developed a                      technology for preparing mono- and di-basic perfluorocarboxylic                 acids in very high yields.  The carboxylic acid functionality can               be converted to various other functionalities such as alcohols,                 amines, halides, sulfonates, etc. which can then be used as                     fluorocarbon intermediates for the synthesis of high-performance                fluorelastomers.  This approach offers many advantages over the                 more classical routes to fluorocarbon elastomers.  Namely,                      polymers made in this manner should be considerably less                        expensive.                                                                           Efforts will be made to synthesize medium-molecular-weight                 (800-5000) perfluoropolyether dibasic carboxylic acids using                    newly developed direct fluorination technology.  The research                   will focus on optimizing the fluorination conditions so that well               defined products can be obtained in high yields.  In order to                   accomplish this, side reactions leading to cross-linking, chain                 degradation, and loss of acid functionality must be avoided.",
