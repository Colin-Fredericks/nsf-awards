 "awd_abstract_narration": "American public policy is remarkably stable and resistent to                    change.  Yet over the past forty years, dramatic changes have                   occurred in American public policies toward women in particular.                This sophisticated empirical study develops and tests a political               process theory to account for the political success of the women's              movement in the United States.                                                                                                                                  Specifically, this study uses longitudinal data on women's movement             activities, public opinion toward women's issues, and congressional             activity to assess the nature and extent of the effect which the                women's movement has had on American public policy.  In addition                to explaining how the women's movement has shaped the development               of public policy, the study should contribute to our understanding              of social movements more generally and how they influence the                   policy process.",
