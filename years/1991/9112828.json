 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millions of disjoint information / computing resources must be                  able to be used cooperatively, efficiently, and transparently.                  Without integration and increased \"intelligence\", the dramatic                  benefits and massive investments in currently disjoint computing                resources may be lost.  The required technical advances depend on               technology integration rather than on any one technology.  Such                 integration requires a shared vision and an identification of the               research, development, and application problems and                             opportunities.  The workshop addresses core technologies to                     support advanced features of next generation information systems,               which we label intelligent and cooperative information systems.                 Core technologies include information/data/knowledge/object                     management, operating systems, artificial intelligence,                         distributed computing, and interoperability. Systems development                and cooperative, distributed work are being addressed in separate               but related workshops.  The workshop addresses this challenge                   through the collective insight and collaboration of academic and                industrial researchers in the key technologies.  Technical                      objectives are to: (i) define the vision, (ii) identify the key                 technologies and integration alternatives; (iii) characterize the               research and development status, (iv) outline technical                         challenges, and (v) investigate specific issues across disjoint                 technologies.  Technical results and recommendations will be                    widely disseminated to the research and development communities.                The unique aspects of this workshop are the focus on technology                 integration and international cooperation.",
