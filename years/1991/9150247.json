The daily thematic design of the                             conference includes: Contents of Physics Teaching, Cognitive                    Processes and Problem Solving, Physics Teaching and Society,                    Experimental Physics and its Teaching, and Alternative ways                     for Communicating Physics and Physics Teaching.  Research in                    physics education will be highlighted.  Strong contributions                    to the quality of physics teaching in the U.S. is expected                      from the Latin-American contingent.  They have demonstrated                     expertise in developing simple and inexpensive equipment as                     part of their approach to the teaching of ethnic groups                         similar in make-up to U.S. minorities.  Translation of these                    materials and techniques to similar minority audiences in                       the U.S. will be a focus of follow-up activities for the                        U.S. participants.  Post-conference expectations include:                       1) the peer-led PTRA Program type workshops to share                            \"lessons learned\", 2) the on-going stimulation and support                      for                                                                             and Training of Elementary Teachers (TNG-7 of AAPT), and 3)                     the development of Educational Partnership facilitated by                       AAPT.
