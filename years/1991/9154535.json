The packet wil                        also be useful to state departments of education and other                      K-12 organizations.                                                                                                                                             Postsecondary institutions will be surveyed, using EDUCOM                       member organizations and other groups; information will also                    be sought through various electronic mail lists and                             conferences.  Questions will include current and planned                        activities in support of K-12 educationl networking; the                        existence of policy statements regarding institutional                          involvement with K-12 organizations; and interest in further                    involvement.                                                                                                                                                    The materials packet will e developed through consultation                      with experts in K-12 networking issues, including known                         groups with K-12 networking systems operating over the                          Internet.  Support programs involved in K-12 science and                        mathematics education will be included.  Contents of the                        packet will include: principles and suggested guidelines for                    institutional involvement; program descriptions (including                      interface screen captures) for K-12 networking interfaces;                      an outline of a user manual oriented toward K-12 users; and                     a \"user roadmap\" of resources accessible over the Internet.                                                                                                     The packet and survey results will be actively disseminated                     through K-12 and postsecondary meetings and conferences, as                     printed materials and through electronic networks.",
