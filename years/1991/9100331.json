 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for a research workshop                 on Banach space theory to be held at the Universidad de los                     Andes (ULA) in Merida, Venezuela, January 6-17, 1992.  The U.S.                 organizer is Bor-Luh Lin, of the University of Iowa; the                        Venezuelan organizer is Jorge B. Vielma, ULA.  The workshop's                   aim is to stimulate cooperative research and the exchange of                    ideas between senior and junior participants, as well as                        between U.S. and Venezuelan mathematicians.  It also would                      provide an opportunity for establishing future cooperation                      between institutions of the two countries.                                                                                                                      The workshop will focus on several important areas of Banach                    space research, such as the local theory and the study of                       geometrical properties of these spaces, the study of extreme                    structures of bounded closed convex sets (a focus of Banach                     space theory in the last 25 years), the existence of nice                       equivalent norms and minimal sets in Banach spaces, and other                   topics in which the geometry of Banach spaces has found many                    important applications.  Workshop participants will also discuss                applications of Banach space techniques to analytic functions,                  nonlinear analysis, partial differential equations, and fixed                   point theory.",
