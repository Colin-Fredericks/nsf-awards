 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish a Research Training Group in                          Cytoskeleton Biology at the University of Minnesota.  The faculty               group includes members of the departments of Cell Biology and                   Neuroanatomy, Genetics and Cell Biology, Biochemistry, and Plant                Biology.  The funds awarded will provide stipends for graduate                  students and postdoctoral trainees, will support research                       participation by undergraduate students and high school students,               and will defray part of the cost of the trainees' research.  In                 addition, funds will be used to purchase specialized research                   equipment to be used by trainees and to bring investigators from                other research and academic institutions to the campus for                      seminars and bi-annual symposia.  University resources will                     augment the funds provided by NSF in most of these categories.                                                                                                  The cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells contains a dynamic, fibrous               network of actin filaments, microtubules and intermediate                       filaments that participate in virtually every aspect of cellular                form and function.  Because of the cytoskeleton's ubiquity and                  its role in cellular processes as diverse as gene expression,                   cell replication and division, and cell movement, studies of the                cytoskeleton provide an excellent focus for multidisciplinary                   training in at the forefront of modern biology.",
