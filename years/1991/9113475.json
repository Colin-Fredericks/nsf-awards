 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Morehouse College Research Scholars Program is designed                   to increase the number of science students who attend graduate                  school and earn the doctorate degree in science.  The                           objectives of the program are:  1) to motivate students                         toward careers in science research through a coordinated                        mentoring program; 2)  to provide participants in the program                   with early research experiences, beginning with a prefreshman                   summer program; 3) to enhance the academic preparation of                       students through enrichment courses, counseling, mentoring,                     colloquia, and seminars; and 4) to provide students with                        information on graduate schools, fellowships and research                       careers.  The program consists of four components to                            accomplish the stated objectives:  1) an academic year                          research and enrichment program for undergraduates;  2) a                       prefreshman summer research and enrichment program;  3) summer                  research activities for upperclassmen; and 4) coordinated                       mentoring/counseling program.  The project will serve a target                  group of up to fifteen scholastically talented undergraduates                   at the College who are science majors.  These students will be                  assigned to faculty mentors who will direct their research                      projects and serve as academic advisors.  The participants                      will enroll in enrichment courses, and participate in student                   colloquia and departmental seminars.  Emphasis will be placed                   on a coordinated mentoring/counseling program to ensure the                     students' academic and research progress.  It is expected that                  the Research Scholars Program will significantly increase the                   number of Morehouse graduates who pursue doctorates in the                      sciences over the next five to ten years.",
