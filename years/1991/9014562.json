 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the investigator's research, with two distinct           parts.  The first part is to explore the scope of the new low degree            polynomial techniques in simulation of complexity classes.  These               methods were invented very recently, with striking results:                     characterizations of the power of interactive proofs and multiprover            interactive proofs.  The new methods do not relativize, a fact with             potentially far reaching consequences in structural complexity theory.                                                                                          The second part is to further develop the algorithmic machinery that            put basic permutation group manipulation in NC and yielded an order of          magnitude improvement in sequential worst case asymptotic time                  complexity.  A striking feature of the new methods is the depth of              group theory required for their analysis.  Indeed, even for                     rudimentary tasks such as membership testing in permutation groups, a           number of consequences of the classification of finite simple groups            have to be invoked.",
