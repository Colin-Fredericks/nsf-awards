 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a model, university-schools collaborative program                       for utilizing a cadre of 100 elementary school teachers, who                    have participated in a three year Science Teacher Institute                     at the University of California, San Diego.  This project                       will support these teachers with the design and delivery of                     staff development programs in science education at the                          elementary school level as well as selecting an elementary                      science curriculum for their school sites or districts.  The                    two-year project is a joint effort of the science faculty of                    the University of California, San Diego, in cooperation with                    and in response to the needs of the San Diego County school                     districts.  The project includes materials and technical                        assistance for these teacher leaders as they attempt to                         change the way science is taught to young children in their                     districts.  It is estimated that over three thousand                            teachers will take part in the three to five day inservice                      programs that these 100 teachers will design and implement                      in their districts.                                                                                                                                             The cost sharing for the project will be 22% of the NSF                         portion.",
