 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the concept of program checking, which            is a technique for gaining confidence in the output of a program.  The          traditional alternatives to program checking are program verification,          which is hard to do, and program testing, which does not provide                mathematical guarantees.  Program checking strikes a healthy                    compromise--designing a checker for a problem is only as difficult as           designing an algorithm for it, but checking provides precise                    guarantees about output correctness.                                            One of the major goals will be to design checkers for problems which            are currently solved by unproven heuristics.  Also, efficient and               practical checkers will be implemented for problems in scientific               computing, with special emphasis on checking software packages for              linear programming, problems in linear algebra, and ordinary and                partial differential equations.                                                 The other major thrust of this research will be to explore the                  implications to program checking of new results on the related                  concepts of interactive proofs and random self reducibility.  Among             the questions considered here will be whether the satisfiability                problem is checkable.                                                           Writing a checker as part of designing software may become standard             practice in the near future, and this research aims to understand the           foundations of program checking.//",
