 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Maine for the repair and renovation of Murray Hall                and Winthrop Libby Hall which house that institution's marine                   biological and biological oceanography research and research                    training activities.  These buildings were constructed,                         respectively, in 1968 and 1962.  Murray Hall has not since been                 renovated, and Winthrop Libby Hall has been expanded by small                   additions in 1965 and 1970, but it has never had any major                      renovations since the time of its construction.  The ARFMP grant                of $100,000 and $110,550 provided by the grantee as cost sharing                will be used to modernize these research and research training                  facilities which are under the aegis of a group of highly                       productive, collaborative marine zoological researchers.  This                  project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure both in terms of health and safety and of building               systems and the configuration of the space.  The project is                     consistent with priorities at the institutional level to expand                 research and graduate training and to emphasize marine and                      biological sciences, at the regional level to expand research                   focused on the Gulf of Maine, and at the national level to develop              thrusts in application of molecular biology to ocean sciences and               in fisheries oceanography.                                                                                                                                      This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate, graduate, and                        postdoctoral students.  The professional development of the                     faculty and their visiting scientists will also accrue from this                renovation.",
