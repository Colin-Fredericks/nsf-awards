 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel type of photosynthesis has recently been discovered in                  the submersed aquatic plant Hydrilla verticillata.                              Photosynthesis, the biochemical process by which plants transform               carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrate, has been shown to                   occur by two primary reaction sequences commonly designated as                  the C3 and C4 pathways.  All photosynthetic organisms utilize the               C3 pathway, however, a few, including corn and sugar cane, also                 possess the C4 reaction sequence and are among the most                         productive plants known.  What makes Hydrilla unique is the                     ability of an individual plant to switch from C3 to C4                          photosynthesis depending upon environmental conditions.                                                                                                         This project will utilize a powerful combination of plant                       physiological and ecological methods in both greenhouse and field               studies to 1) quantify the environmental conditions associated                  with the C4 state in the field, 2) determine the environmental                  cues that induce the C4 state, 3) compare the photosynthetic and                productivity rates of C3 and C4 Hydrilla plants, 4) determine the               environmental conditions under which C4 photosynthesis benefits                 growth, and 5) determine the importance of C4 photosynthesis to                 the overall productivity of this plant.                                                                                                                         Hydrilla is native to tropical Africa and Asia.  It was                         introduced into Florida during the early 1960's by the aquarium                 plant industry, and because of its prolific growth currently                    threatens freshwater resources throughout the southern United                   States.  Therefore, elucidation of its photosynthetic physiology                may contribute knowledge important for the control of this                      noxious weed.  Such knowledge may also facilitate breeding                      efforts to introduce desirable C4 traits into C3 crop plants and                possibly increase crop yield.  Furthermore, understanding the                   environmental conditions that induce C4 photosynthesis in this                  plant may give insights into the forces that resulted in the                    evolution of C4 photosynthesis in flowering plants.",
