 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research to determine the                           technical feasibility of a process for removal of organic                       substances of potentially toxic significance from water.                        The process involves passage of contaminated water through                      a fixed-bed, adsorbing medium and regeneration of the                           exhausted adsorbing medium by a photocatalytic process                          based on use of n-type semiconductor photocatalysts such                        as titanium dioxide.  Regeneration of the adsorbing medium                      and destruction of the adsorbates are expected to be                            accomplished by radical species formed when the catalysis                       is subjected to illumination with ultra- and near-ultra                         light radiation.                                                                                                                                                Adsorption processes are recognized as being effective for                      removal of organic pollutants from water.  Economic                             feasibility of adsorption depends largely on ability to                         regenerate the adsorbing properties of the adsorbing                            medium and to deal effectively with the organic substances                      released during the regeneration process.  Results of this                      research are expected to be used for devising mathematical                      models that can be used in potential selection and                              engineering design of processes and systems for use in                          decontamination of water for municipal and industrial                           needs.",
