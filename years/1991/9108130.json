 "awd_abstract_narration": "Various highly reactive intermediates will be generated and a                   study will be made of their reaction mechanisms. These highly                   reactive intermediates will be generated by photolysis and by                   pyrolysis of appropriate precursors. Decay kinetics of these                    species will be followed by time-resolved spectroscopy following                laser flash photolysis. Chemical reactivity of these intermediates              will be probed through trapping experiments and product studies.                The molecules to be studied include species containing divalent                 silicon, germanium, and tin atoms, namely, silylenes, germylenes,               and stannylenes, respectively. Reaction pathways for the                        monovalent six-valence-electron species nitrenes (R-N:) and                     phosphinidenes (R-P:), and of the monovalent four-valence-electron              borylenes (R-B:) and aluminylidenes (R-Al:) will be compared with               reaction paths for the corresponding carbenes, silylenes, and                   germylenes. Molecules will be synthesized with new kinds of bonds,              including silicon-silicon and silicon-germanium triple bonds, and               silicon-transition metal double bonds. New ring systems will be                 prepared as well.                                                               %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Peter P. Gaspar at Washington                      University. Reactive intermediates will be generated that contain               silicon, germanium, tin, phosphorous, aluminum, and boron atoms                 that have less than their normal complement of bonds. These                     reactive intermediates will be generated from stable precursor                  molecules by photolysis and by thermolysis methods. The steps by                which these intermediates decompose will be studied as well as                  the rate at which these processes occur. More direct evidence for               these reactive intermediates will be given by trapping them with                other molecules. The products of these trapping experiments will                reveal the structure of the intermediates. Compounds with silicon-              silicon single and double bonds are known. Now even more reactive               molecules will be synthesized with silicon-silicon and silicon-                 germanium triple bonds. New ring systems will also be prepared.",
