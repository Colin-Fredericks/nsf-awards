 "awd_abstract_narration": "Broadcast and Multicast are paradigms that are central to many state-           of-the-art fault-tolerant distributed systems.  Despite their                   fundamental importance, these paradigms are not yet completely                  understood.  Many of their aspects are still unexplored and many                crucial issues remain to be solved.  The goal of this research is to            develop a deeper understanding of the foundations of fault-tolerant             broadcasts and multicasts.  The work will focus on Reliable Broadcast,          Causal Broadcast and Atomic Broadcast and the corresponding multicast           formulations.  The investigation will include the following problems            in the context of several types of failure models and communication             networks:  (1) development of specifications, algorithms, and lower             bounds for the new problem of preventing inconsistency and                      contamination via broadcasts and multicasts initiated by faulty                 processes.  (2) development of algorithms and lower bounds for Causal           Broadcasts and Multicasts.  (3) development of Reliable and Atomic              Broadcast    protocols that are simultaneously time-efficient and               message-efficient, with a performance that gracefully degrades as the           number of failures that actually occur increases.",
