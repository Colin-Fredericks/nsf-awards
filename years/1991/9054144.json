 "awd_abstract_narration": "The third conference on Computational Physics in the Undergraduate              Curriculum is being held October 2-5, 1991.  Targeting                          undergraduate physics faculty, the conference provides an                       opportunity for faculty to explore two of the most promising                    developments in computational physics: (1) symbolic computational               packages, such as Mathematica, and (2) pre-compiled packages, such              as MUPPET (Maryland University Project in Physics and Technology).                                                                                              In order to increase the impact of this conference on the physics               community, the project is being advertised nationally and utilizes              speakers of proven ability and national recognition in the field                of software development.  The project includes post-conference                  workshops on the most promising software development tools suitable             for distribution to physics faculty and students.  Development                  tools, software, and conference proceedings are being distributed               to all conference participants.",
