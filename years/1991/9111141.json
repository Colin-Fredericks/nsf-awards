 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of ceramic materials to withstand high temperature and              hostile environments offers great prospect for potential major                  improvements in the design performance of high temperature                      components in chemical processing, power generation and industrial              waste recovery applications.  Their use as structural materials,                however, has been limited primarily because of their poor fracture              toughness and lack of damage tolerance.  Although research in the               past has resulted in major advances in the low temperature                      toughening of ceramics especially be second phase reinforcements,               the majority of these low temperature toughening mechanisms become              ineffective at high temperatures.  In this research the fundamental             micromechanisms of high temperature subcritical crack growth in                 three classes of ceramic-matrix composites, chosen to reflect                   different primary room temperature toughening mechanisms, namely                crack deflection, crack trapping and crack bridging, will be                    examined.  The approach will be 1) to develop a viable high                     temperature crack growth monitoring technique in semiconducting                 ceramics, ii) to identify salient mechanisms impeding crack                     advances in these composites at high temperatures, iii) to examine              the microstructural origins of these mechanisms in terms of the                 interaction between the crack and the constituents of the                       composite, iv) to document the toughening from these mechanisms as              a function of the microstructural parameters, and v) to establish               physical models describing the microstructural dependence of the                toughening mechanism.",
