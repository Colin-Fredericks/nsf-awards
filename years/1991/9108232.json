 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research in this proposal is designed to examine                            stigma/pollen interactions in the self-fertile crucifer                         Arabidopsis thaliana. The molecular work will initially focus on                the members of a multigene family in Arabidopsis that are                       homologous to the well characterized S-multigene family in                      Brassica. In the self-incompatible crucifer, Brassica, members of               the S-multigene family produce protein products functioning in                  the stigma/pollen interactions of pollination, including the                    cell-cell recognition and rejection of self pollen, which                       prevents inbreeding. Since Arabidopsis is self-fertile, it does                 not have functional self-incompatibility genes but does carry S-                homologous regions that may be equivalent to the members of the                 Brassica S-multigene family involved in the pollination response.               Their analysis in Arabidopsis system will elucidate aspects of                  the pollination process at the molecular level. Specifically,                   Arabidopsis S-homologous genomic clones and a PCR-generated                     fragment already isolated using Brassica S-gene sequences are                   being characterized by restriction mapping and sequencing to                    develop Arabidopsis S-homologous and gene-specific probes. With                 these probes expression and organization of the S-multigene                     family in the Arabidopsis genome will be determined. Expression                 of an S-related sequence has already been demonstrated by RNA                   blot analysis. Additional S-related transcripts will be isolated                from a cDNA library prepared from flower polyA+ RNA. Their                      temporal and spatial expression will be analyzed by in situ                     hybridization and GUS reporter gene expression regulated by the                 S-related gene(s)' promoter. The available molecular genetics of                Arabidopsis (RFLP maps and contiguous cosmid and YAC libraries)                 will facilitate characterization of the genomic organization of                 the S-related multigene family. The ease of Arabidopsis                         transformation via Agrobacterium will facilitate study of the                   function of the S-related gene(s) by gene inactivation using                    antisense constructs. Ligand blotting will be used to determine                 if the S-related proteins bind specifically to any pollen                       proteins.",
