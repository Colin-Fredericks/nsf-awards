 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned principally with the mathematical               and numerical analysis of problems related to liquid crystals.                  Also considered is the numerical analysis of singularly-perturbed               ordinary differential equations.  The analysis of liquid-crystal                problems involves interdisciplinary work with the Glenn H. Brown                Liquid Crystal Institute (LCI) at Kent State University; it is                  primarily concerned with analyzing and numerically simulating the               equilibrium configurations of liquid crystal molecules in small                 confinements, as arise in polymer-dispersed liquid crystals                     (PDLC's), with special attention to defect structures and the                   influence of geometry, boundary conditions, and external applied                fields.  These solution fields are modeled, using a continuum                   mathematical model, as minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes free                  energy functional, which derives from the Landau theory of phase                transitions.  These problems, with their large number of degrees                of freedom (a tensor order parameter) and spatial dimensions                    (three), lead to challenging large-scale scientific computing                   problems requiring robust and efficient techniques of finite                    element discretization, large-sparse optimization, and numerical                bifurcation in the presence of symmetry breaking.  The work in                  the area of singular perturbations is concerned with the further                development, refinement, and extension of a general uniform                     stability theory for linear and nonlinear differential equations                of arbitrary order.      The main significance and importance of                these projects derives from the interdisciplinary aspect of the                 work on liquid crystals.  The investigator will perform numerical               simulations on current problems of interest to the theoretical                  and experimental physicists in the LCI.  He will bring to bear                  state-of-the-art techniques from modern numerical analysis and                  scientific computing to complement physical theory and                          experiment.  Investigators in the LCI are at their limits, using                sophisticated NMR techniques, to probe the structure of liquid                  crystals in the very small (submicron) size containments in                     certain display technologies currently under development.  It is                hoped that numerical simulations will play an important role                    here.",
