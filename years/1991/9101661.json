 "awd_abstract_narration": "A set of undergraduate laboratory experiments which                        duplicate current ongoing research activities and techniques in                 the field of atomic/laser physics will be developed.  These                     experiments will use tuneable narrowband diode laser systems.                   The first experiment is the use of lasers to obtain very high                   resolution Doppler-free saturated absorption spectra in alkali                  vapor cells.  The majority of the work will be the development of               an inexpensive apparatus in which undergraduates can trap neutral               atoms and cool them to temperatures on the order of a                           microkelvin.  These experiments will be a slightly modified                     version of state-of-the-art experiments in laser cooling and                    trapping, and will be tested in an advanced lab course.  The goal               of the work will be the development of a very simple                            inexpensive apparatus which can be widely duplicated, and                       which will allow undergraduates to become involved in a                         current area of physics research.",
