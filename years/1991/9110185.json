 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will study the fundamentals of monitoring in-situ              consolidation of thermoplastic composites in filament winding based             on dynamic dielectric analysis.  In spite of its demonstrated                   advantages in production rate, cost, and process flexibility,                   thermoplastic filament winding with in-situ consolidation has not               been widely accepted for industrial applications because of the                 high void content of the wound part resulting from the variation                of consolidation at the filament lay down point.  The investigation             aims at identifying the degree of thermoplastic resin consolidation             at the lay down point through analyzing its resin rheology                      properties by frequency-dependent electromagnetic sensing                       methodology.  The uniqueness of the research is the concept of                  imbedding dynamic dielectric measurement in the compaction process              to provide a near-field, non-destructive, and non-intrusive sensing             technique which enables the in-process assessment of the critical               material properties that directly contribute to the part quality                and productivity.  The work will formulate the analytical basis of              the technique, establish the fundamental understanding of the                   relationship between dynamic dielectric parameters (namely the                  permittivity, loss factor and conductivity) and the in-situ                     consolidation process, demonstrate the concept feasibility through              simulation testings, and explore the advantages and limitations of              the methodology through prototype system implementation on a                    filament winding station.                                                            The successful completion of this research is expected to                  remove a major obstacle in the advancement of filament winding                  technology by the establishment of a much needed in-process                     monitoring methodology.  The investigation will also open up new                opportunities for feedback control and optimization research in the             critical area of intelligent processing of advanced composites.",
