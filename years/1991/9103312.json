 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contrary to previous suggestions of uniform, warm and equable                 climatic conditions during the Late Cretaceous, foraminiferal                   isotopic results from deep-sea and onshore sequences reveal                     progressive cooling, and significant climatic and oceanographic                 variability during the Maastrichtian.  Episodes of marked                       increase in forminiferal values correlate with decreases in                     specified oceanic values, documented sea level regressions and                  increases in seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the early to late,                    and latest Maastrichtian.  The coincidence of these events, and                 the similarity between Maastrichtian benthic foraminifera                       values and those of middle Eocene age associate with ice-rafted                 debris, suggest that these variations might be related to                       glacioeustatic phenomena.  The research proposed will                           investigate and document the climatic and oceanographic history                 of the early to late Maastrichtian in the high and mid latitude                 South Atlantic and Indian Oceans based on foraminiferal oxygen                  and carbon isotope measurements, and foraminiferal quantitative                 analyses.  Biostratigraphic correlation of deep-sea sections                    will be enhanced by integration of biostratigraphy,                             magnetostratigraphy and chemostratigraphy.  Evidence of                         substantial continental ice accumulation in the Maastrichtian                   will have significant implications for modeling of Cretaceous                   climates as well as interpretations of climatic history in                      general.                                                                          This project should lead to better paleooceanographic                         reconstructions, relevant to climatic evolution, suggesting                     when and how certain changes developed.  It furthers VPW                        program objectives to provide opportunities for women to                        advance their careers in science or engineering through                         research, and to encourage other women to pursue careers in                     these areas through the investigators' enhanced visibility as                   role models on the host campuses.  In this project, the                         proposed activities which contribute to the second objective                    include:  teaching a course in chemical-biotic relations in the                 fossil record; giving lectures in geologic topics to                            universities, colleges and high schools near Princeton                          University to encourage women students to pursue scientific                     careers; co-teaching a departmental seminar each semester.",
