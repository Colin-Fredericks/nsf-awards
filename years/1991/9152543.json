 "awd_abstract_narration": "St.  John's College, with its unique approach to education, has                 been particularly successful at integrating the sciences into                   a liberal arts curriculum.  Because a working knowledge of                      observational astronomy is fundamental to understanding many of                 the readings of the St.  John's program, in music and                           literature as well as in mathematics and physics, St. John's                    College is upgrading its capabilities with the purchase of a                    14\" telescope, equipped for photometric applications, installed                 in a permanently mounted dome on the Annapolis campus.  A                       faculty study group is developing manuals and collecting                        original papers to guide the use of astronomical telescopes in                  a liberal arts setting.The addition of this telescope and                       laboratory manuals materially enhances the science portion of                   the curriculum and also benefits all other parts of the St.                     John's program.  This project may be a model for other liberal                  arts colleges and a growing number of secondary schools who                     have expressed interest in the program.",
