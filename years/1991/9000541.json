 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the design and control of machines that                 will have stable dynamic interaction with humans via simultaneous               exchange of both power and information signals.  Typically, human               interaction with machines involves an exchange of information                   signals only, i.e., pushing the start button on and activating an               electric mixer, but not transferring power directly to the mixer,               or feeling the load on the mixer blades.  Orthoses, devices                     attached directly to a human for the purpose of performing a task               or aiding a handicapped individual, are examples of machines                    which do involve the exchange of power and information between                  human and machine.  This research is a five phase activity which                focuses on (1) development of a learning controller for on line                 computer modeling of human hand dynamic behavior, (2) development               of the rules for the design of a supervisor controller to create                a particular behavior that humans cannot perform unaided, (3)                   study of the design of a multi degree of freedom orthosis that                  can exchange power and information signals with humans, (4)                     design and fabrication of a prototype orthosis and computing                    environment, and (5) experimental evaluation of the performance                 of this system.  The ultimate objective is a prototype orthosis                 which transfers to the human's hand, in feedback fashion, a                     scaled down version of the actual external load which the                       orthosis is manipulating.  This natural feedback force on the                   human's hand lets her feel a modified version of the external                   forces on the orthosis.",
