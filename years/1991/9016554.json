 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Nancy Ide, Vassar College, and Dr. Jean Veronis, Groupe                         Representation et Traitement des Connaissances, French                          National Center for Scientific Research, Marseille, France.                     The objective of the project is the construction of a large-                    scale lexical and textual database from machine-readable                        materials in French and English, with the goal of extracting                    information that can be used for automatic language processing                  tasks.                                                                                                                                                          A number of machine-readable materials in French and English,                   including dictionaries in typesetter's format, but also                         corpora and other linguistic data, have been acquired by the                    project and installed at each site. Software tools have been                    developed to structure, access and analyze these data,                          utilizing compatible hardware and software systems in order to                  enable their use in both locations.  The project involves                       three avenues of research:  1) the structuring of machine                       readable dictionaries and other linguistics data into a                         consistent lexical database, 2) the extraction of machine-                      usable knowledge from dictionary definition texts for use in                    natural language understanding and generation and 3) the                        construction of large neural networks from dictionary texts                     and experimentation with these networks for language analytic                   tasks, such as word sense disambiguation.  The project will                     benefit from the complementary expertise of the two investi-                    gators in lexical database and the results of this research                     may make a significant contribution to the fields of                            lexicography and machine translation.",
