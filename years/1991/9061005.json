 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a stated need for low-temperature processes                            for the deposition of semiconductor devices on top of                           insulators.  In particular, nonlinear devices are                               needed in the liquid crystal display industry in active                         matrix liquid crystal displays.  The maximum size of                            displays is limited in part by the difficulty in                                producing small, nonlinear devices over large area                              glass substrates.  This proposal addresses a possible                           solution to this problem:  the fabrication of                                   semiconductor devices through the use of a spin-                                coatable semiconducting polymer coating.  Previously,                           the insolubility of semiconducting polymer coating                              which is sufficiently soluble in organic solvents to                            produce spin-coated films of thicknesses from 0.1                               micron to 4 microns with a resistivity ranging from 10                          to 300 ohm cm.  The polymer is a substituted version                            of polyaniline.  We propose to determine the                                    feasibility of using Brewer Science's spin-coatable                             semiconducting polymer to make nonlinear electrical                             devices, such as diodes and thin film transistors, of                           the type that would be used in active matrix liquid                             crystal displays.  These devices could be used in other                         general applications as well.",
