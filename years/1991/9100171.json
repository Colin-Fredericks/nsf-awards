 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weather fronts in middle latitudes are represented as                      extended lines, seperating air masses with contrasting                          properties, on synoptic scale weather maps. A close-up view,                    however, shows the typical front as a transition zone, covering                 tens of kilometers in the cross-front direction, while extending                for thousands of kilometers in the along-front direction. On the                large scale, broad and converging wind patterns bring streams of                contrasting air into collision at the frontal zone, tending to                  narrow and intensify it. Observations from instrumented towers                  and aircraft reveal a rich microsture within the zone,                          characterized by turbulence and large vertical motions. The                     small-scale processes act to mix properties, and  to dissipate                  and disperse kinetic energy away from the zone, and thus tend to                broaden and weaken the front. Blumen proposes to study the                      relative roles of these processes, acting on widely differing                   scales.                                                                                                                                                              Since there is, at present, no accepted conceptual model of                the complex circulation within the zone, Blumen's approach is to                postulate a simple (mathematically) set of dynamical models,                    representing both scales, varying in the values of a few coeffi-                cients. Solutions will be sought that match the frontal zone to                 its ambient large scale flow regime. Such solutions provide                     predictions of key features of the zone, viz., energy dissipation               rates, how energy is distributed among the smaller scales within                the frontal zone, and the width of the zone. These predictions                  will be compared with observations collected during the STORM-                  FEST field experiment in 1992. The significance of this study is                related to improvements in the quality of large-scale weather                   forecasting and climate simulation models. Currently available                  models do not take account of dissipation within frontal zones                  because the small scales are not resolved. The present approach                 is intended to provide some representation of this important                    process that could be used in future models.",
