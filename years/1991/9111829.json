 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports travel for thirty five US researchers to                  participate in the Eighth Congress of the International                         Federation for the Theory of Machines and Mechanisms to be held                 in Prague, Czechoslovakia on August 28-31, 1991.  The thirty five               participants receiving support are to be selected from a list of                90 US participants.  Professors Seireg and Roth, of the                         University of Wisconsin and Stanford University respectively, are               distinguished researchers in this area, and will select the                     participants based on six criteria including stature in the                     field, potential contribution of the research, need for support,                and geographic distribution of US participants. This meeting is a               major event in the mechanisms field, and US involvement is                      absolutely necessary.  It is an excellent forum for technical                   exchange at the international level.  The selection criteria are                correct, and will insure a broad cross section representation of                US research in mechanisms and associated topics.",
