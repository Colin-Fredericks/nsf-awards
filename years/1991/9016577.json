The Indian organizing committee is chaired by Dr.P.T.                    Monaharan of The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in                        Madras.  Several participants are expected from the U.K., the                   FRG, and the U.S.S.R.  The topics to be covered will include:                   the role of metal ions in biology; reaction mechanisms;                         optical, magnetic and catalytic properties of metal-ion                         containing systems; proteins, enzymes, ion transport; enzymes                   containing zinc, cobalt; vitamin B12 and B12 coenzymes; iron                    heme proteins; oxygenases, peroxidases, catalyses,                              cytochromes; chlorophylls and photosynthesis; non-heme iron                     proteins; iron transfer, electro transfer, electron transport                   proteins; molybdenum proteins and nitrogen fixation;                            nitrogenase, xanthine oxidases, dehydrogenases, sulphite                        aldehyde oxidases; copper proteins; construction of model                       system metal-containing sites; and applications in medicine.                                                                                                    Scope:  The area of the workshop is an important                                subdiscipline of chemistry which is gaining increasing                          attention in the developed countries but which is relatively                    new to developing countries.  The Government of India,                          Department of Science and Technology is attempting to                           stimulate interest and to increase education and research                       activities in the field partially through the sponsoring of                     this workshop.  Indian young researchers with potential for                     work in this area will be exposed to and will interact with                     senior Indian scientists and world leaders in the field                         through lectures and discussion sessions.  The U.S. side will                   benefit by the interaction with European and Indian                             scientists and by identifying potential collaborators from                      India.",
