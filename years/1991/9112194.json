 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed conference deals with two topics that are                          clearly inter-related but have not been dealt with together                     previously.  Research over the last several years has                           revealed that several bacterial and eukaryotic RNA processing                   enzymes possess an RNA component that in itself has catalytic                   activity.  Interest in such enzymes and catalytic RNAs has                      been broad and progress rapid, leading to the award of the                      Nobel Prize to workers in the area in 1989.  Recently,                          research in bacterial mRNA decay has also been vigorous,                        although the process is still poorly defined.  However, the                     decay of mRNA is formally similar to RNA processing and very                    recent work, from several American, European and Japanese                       laboratories, indicates that these two processes have                           components in common.  The objective of the conference is to                    provide a forum where workers in these two rapidly moving                       areas can interact and exchange information.                                    The meeting has the sponsorship of the American Society of                      Microbiology.  It is to be organized by Drs. David Apirion                      and Donald Nierlich at a site on the U.S. Eastern seaboard,                     and held October 27-31, 1991.  Seven regular sessions and                       three poster sessions are planned.  An opening talk is to be                    given by Dr. Sydney Altman (New Haven) and the closing talk                     by Dr. Marianne Grunberg-Manago (Paris).",
