 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growing concerns about the consequences of forest clearance have             increased the need to understand more completely the processes by which         human activity affects the species composition, structure, and dynamics         of forests.  Some earlier studies of forest degradation and conversion          now have been criticized as having been short-sighted, superficial, and         excessively alarmist, but other studies have highlighted the significant        changes that can result from a variety of human activities.  This               project will contribute new insights about the complex dynamics of              change in forests through a lengthy, detailed case study of                     deforestation in the upland forests on the southeastern flank of the            Dhaulagiri Himal range of western Nepal.  Extensive field work by the           investigator and native assistants will gather data about vegetation            characteristics, physical characteristics, and human use and management         practices for roughly 50 forest stands controlled by native villages in         the region.  These data will be analyzed through direct and indirect            gradient analyses to assess the impacts of human, physical, and natural         factors on vegetational dynamics.                                                  This project will provide valuable new insights about the complex            processes through which people and natural forces interact within and           near upland forests.  Because methods used in this analysis have been           used elsewhere, this study will complement other research and add to            general knowledge about these types of processes.  This Research in             Undergraduate Institutions award also will support general research and         educational activities at a predominantly undergraduate institution.",
