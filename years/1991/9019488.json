 "awd_abstract_narration": "These investigations are designed to characterize the mechanism by              which a nuclear plastome mutator (pm) gene causes mutations in the              plastid genome (plastome) of Oenothera.  Genetic and molecular                  traits shared by pm and various bacterial mutators are consistent               with the pm gene encoding a topoisomerase, helicase, or polymerase              that functions within the chloroplast (cp).  Another possibility is             that absence of the pm-product increases levels of error-prone                  repair of cpDNA.  Experiments to differentiate among these                      alternatives include chemical mutagenesis treatments of pm seeds,               where a synergistic response to a number of mutagens will indicate              a general defect in a component of cpDNA repair.  Determination of              the extent of slipped strand mispairing in the pm isolates will                 show the likelihood that a defective helicase or topoisomerase is               involved.  Other experiments are designed to locate the sites of                existing pm-mutations, and to isolate new pm-mutations in the rbcL              gene.  Sequence data from these sites will indicate whether pm                  causes base substitutions, small deletions, or other alterations,               as well as sizeable deletions observed in other, non-coding regions             of cpDNA and occurring between short direct repeats.                                                                                                            In addition to providing insights into the molecular events that                result in the mutation of cpDNA, these investigations are pertinent             to the history of the cpDNA molecule, which, in an evolutionary                 time frame, has experienced frequent deletions, insertions and                  inversions mediated by short direct repeats.***",
