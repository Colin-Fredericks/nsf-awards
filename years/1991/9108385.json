 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the problem of modeling time in dynamic                  domains given incomplete and uncertain information about the                    domain.  The  first objective is to construct a dynamic model                   within a belief-network paradigm and to demonstrate how well                    known time series concepts-such as backward smoothing forward                   filtering and forecasting - are implemented in this model.  The                 dynamic model will be generated semiautomatically given a belief                network that models the time-invariant relations of the domain.                 This will provide a semiautomatic method for extending existing                 belief network models to dynamic belief-network models that can                 be used in applications where consideration of the time evolution               of system variables is crucial to making valid inferences about                 the domain.  The second objective is to design an efficient                     randomized approximation scheme (RAS) for probabilistic inference               in belief networks to be employed by the dynamic model.  Certain                features unique to a RAS, compared to other stochastic simulation               algorithms for probabilistic inference, make the RAS desirable as               an inference algorithm for a dynamic model.  For example, in                    dynamic domains, the time required to make a decision enters the                utility of the decision when this time becomes comparable to the                expected time in which the system changes sufficiently to                       outdated a decision.  A RAS provides an a priori bound on the                   running time required to achieve a predefined level of accuracy                 in the output.  This information can be used to reduce the loss                 of utility due to delayed decisions.  Existing RASs for                         probabilistic inference in belief networks are known to have a                  poor worst-case behavior, although it is conjectured that they                  have efficient average-case complexity.  This research will                     characterize the class of belief networks or which existing RASs                run efficiently, then will extend these algorithms to handle                    cases that fall outside of this class.  The new RASs developed                  will be subsequently optimized specifically for computing                       inferences in the dynamic models developed.",
