 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reviews of classical embryological studies generally argue that                 the anterior-posterior axis in the developing nervous system                    results from anterior and posterior inducing activities in dorsal               mesoderm acting during gastrulation. It is also usually concluded               that these regional properties are present in the dorsal mesoderm               even before gastrulation commences. Dr. Grainger has found,                     however, that the regional inducing capacity of anterior and                    posterior mesoderm in Xenopus embryos is not fixed at gastrula                  stages, but only at neurula stages, He also finds that regional                 neuralization in the responding ectoderm is only fixed at the                   later stage as well. These results and a critical reevaluation of               the literature on neural induction lead him to support a model                  differing from the classical view; he suggests that regional                    inducing capacity in the mesoderm and the establishment of                      anterior-posterior properties in the nervous system are only                    gradually acquired during gastrulation. He proposes experiments                 which will test several aspects of the proposed model and thereby               aims to clarify the nature of the tissue interactions leading to                regionalization of the nervous system. These studies will provide               the information required for future studies of the signalling                   systems and gene activities leading to neural regionalization.",
