 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sense of taste involves interaction of a taste molecule                     with a taste receptor cell, and the process of sensory                          transduction turns that event into a nerve signal to be sent to                 the brain.  There are several possible ways in which a tastant                  molecule can interact with the receptor cell, and the molecular                 mechanisms of sweet taste transduction are not known.  There are                some particular compounds known to suppress sweet taste, and                    these taste modifiers provide a useful tool to explore                          transduction.                                                                                                                                                   This small exploratory project will use a novel genetic                         approach to study sweet taste transduction mechanisms.  The model               system used is the fruit fly of the genus Drosophila, which is                  very well known for genetic work.  Hawaiian species provide                     unusually large animals in comparison to most laboratory strains,               large enough to neurophysiological testing as well as behavioral                work.  Behavioral tests will be used to screen for flies that                   cannot taste specific sugars, and these variants will be bred and               the mutant strains maintained.  The mutant flies will be compared               to the wild types in terms of their behavioral and physiological                responses to taste stimuli and the sweet-suppressing compounds.                 Breeding studies will determine the genetic basis for the                       responses.  Results will provide a new access to sweet taste                    mutant strains for molecular genetic studies, and will have an                  impact not only on taste physiology, but also on genetics, on                   evolutionary and environmental biology, and even on pest control                by information gained on the genetics of insect feeding behavior.",
