The experiment will take                   place at the Kennedy Space Center during Summer 1991 and will                   involve rocket-triggered lightning.  The proposed measurements                  and analysis are important for the modelling of the lower part of               the lightning channel, in particular the lightning attachment                   process and the coupling of electromagnetic energy from very                    close lightning to overhead wires.                                                   The electromagnetics research group from the Ecole                         Polytechnique Federal de Lausanne in Switzerland has offered to                 share with the University of Florida their electric field                       measuring equipment:  2 Thomson CSF electric field sensors                      (wideband EMP sensors ideally suited for close lightning                        measurements), a LeCroy 4 channel digitalizing oscilloscope, and                a controlling computer.  Additionally the group will provide one                experienced Ph.D. student and possibly one additional graduate                  student who will travel to the Kennedy Space Center for Summer                  1991 to cooperate with our research group in making the proposed                electric field measurements and who will bring the Swiss                        equipment to Gainesville and help in the calibration in Spring                  1991.",
