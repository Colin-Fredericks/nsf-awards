 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mammal Collection of the University of Utah's Museum of                Natural History comprises 28,000 specimens, most of which                       represent the fauna of the western U.S.  After a period of very                 low research activity, Dr. Eric Rickart, Curator in charge of the               collection, has instituted an aggressive program of research and                curatorial improvement in the collection.  A computer catalog has               been prepared, physical facilities have been renovated, and an                  inventory and reorganization of the collection will be initiated.                    Curatorial improvements to this collection will have                       significant impact on zoological research and education in Utah.                Natural history collections such as this are irreplaceable                      libraries of data concerning life on earth, and they form the                   foundation for research on systematics, evolution, ecology, and                 other facets of biology.  This collection provides an excellent                 record of an important vertebrate fauna, against which future                   changes will be measured.  Future generations of research will                  depend on its continued care and growth.",
