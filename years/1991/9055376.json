 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of New Hampshire seeks funds for the                             three-year program to impact the direction of the teaching                      and learning of mathematics in the rural regions of the                         Northeastern United States.  Teams of a middle and a high                       school teacher of mathematics and a school supervisor or                        administrator from each of 12 rural schools or school                           districts in the Northeast will participate in the                              project.  The teachers will attend two summer institutes:                       the first a four-week institute whose focus will be the                         teaching and learning of algebra and of statistics, and                         the second a three-week institute on assessment.  The                           teachers and their supervisor/administrator will then                           attend a two-week institute the  third summer which will                        focus on leadership development, the change process in                          the schools, and conducting inservice workshops.  School                        year follow-up activities will include a yearly fall                            meeting at NCTM's Northeast Regional Conference and a                           yearly spring session at the University of New Hampshire                        as well as school visitations by the staff.                                                                                                                     In addition to the 36 first wave teachers and                                   administrators, it is anticipated that an additional 360                        second-wave middle and high school teachers and                                 administrators will be enhanced.  The University of New                         Hampshire's cost-sharing will account for 7% of the NSF                         budget.                                                                                                                                                         Enhancing the teaching and learning of middle and high                          school mathematics in rural pockets of the United States                        must be a vital component of improving mathematics                              education for the 21st Century.  This project can serve                         as a model for such enhancement.",
