 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop new instructional                   materials that change, fundamentally, how structural geology is                 taught to undergraduate students in the earth sciences.                         Current textbooks and laboratory manuals present excellent                      treatments of the geometric description and classification of                   rock structures, but do not effectively integrate this material                 with the principles and quantitative methods of structural                      analysis based on continuum mechanics. A new textbook,                          specifically designed to accomplish this integration, can be                    used to disseminate the project results to other educators and                  students. Packaged with the textbook, and representing a fresh                  approach to instructional materials in structural geology, is                   a floppy disk of computer exercises keyed to chapters in the                    textbook. The exercises are set up as templates using Microsoft                 Excel for computation and graphics, and are compatible with                     both the Macintosh and IBM PC. The computer exercises combine                   the map data and descriptive observations of classical                          structural geology with the relevant mathematical methods and                   principles of engineering mechanics. By making concepts                         understandable and analysis methods available that heretofore                   have been restricted to graduate courses or practicing                          professionals, this project prepares undergraduates better for                  advanced degrees and professional careers. The language and                     methods learned in this course prepare geologists to                            communicate effectively with engineers and other scientists, a                  key requirement for the multidisciplinary problem solving                       methods that will typify industrial practices in the next                       century. This project aims to provide a prototype for                           instructional materials that can be emulated across the                         spectrum of earth science education.",
