 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment acquired by this award will be used in the User                   Studies Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University for Human-Computer             Interaction (HCI) studies.  The equipment consists of video                     equipment for recording actions of users, editing equipment for                 annotating these actions, and a computer with large disk store for              storing video images and for processing data.  The research                     projects using the equipment include testing models of HCI, studies             of spoken and multi-modal computer interfaces, and computer                     tutoring.                                                                                                                                                       The use of computers is ubiquitous both in the workplace and in                 schools.  An important aspect of the use of computers is the                    human/computer interface; the means by which computers and humans               exchange information.  The design of good interfaces is more of an              art form than a science.  The researchers at the User Studies                   Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University will use this                          Instrumentation award to purchase equipment essential to their                  research.  This equipment will enable them to study, in great                   detail, how users interact with computers.  It will enable them to              test theories of what makes a good interface and will also enable               them to study students using the computer for learning purposes.",
