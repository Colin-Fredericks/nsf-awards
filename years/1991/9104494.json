 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone which is very important in the                     regulation of salt and water balance,  and in reproduction and in               the stimulation of mammary growth and function.  The pituitary of               bony fishes is an attractive system for studying prolactin (PRL)                secretion.  Unique among vertebrate animals, teleost PRL cells are              segregated as a nearly homogeneous mass which is easily separated               for study in isolation from other body systems.  Also, these PRL                cells can be maintained in their normal cell-cell associations for              at least two weeks in culture dishes.  These features facilitate                the achievement of the goals of this project which are to                       characterize PRL secretory mechanisms using normal (i.e. not                    cancerous) tissues.  Studies will be directed toward the                        examination of several peptide and steroid hormones that may be                 important regulators of PRL cell function.  These factors will be               used to continue the characterization of the mechanisms that                    control PRL cells.  Companion studies will examine the manner in                which the PRL cell responds to osmotic pressure.  These studies                 will help to clarify how the secretion of the hormones that control             salt and water balance is regulated.//",
