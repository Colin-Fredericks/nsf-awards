 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is expanding the instructional equipment                           associated with an intermediate optics laboratory for junior                    and senior physics majors at Pennsylvania State University. New                 experiments are being introduced that employ modern optical                     tools for quantitative measurement, replacing a number of the                   more traditional experiments which have relied on visual                        observation of interference/diffraction patterns. For the most                  part, the experiments apply multichannel detection to perform                   unique experiments in polarimetry and spectroscopy, with the                    intent to demonstrate the fundamental principles of optics and                  to convey the excitement of research at the forefront of                        optical physics. The principles and concepts demonstrated in                    the laboratory include the interaction of light with matter:                    the Fresnel equations, reflectance, transmittance, dispersion,                  absorption, dieletric functions, birefringence, optical                         activity, thin film interference, multilayer films, and                         diffraction gratings. The laboratories are teaching one- and                    two-dimensional Fourier analysis, coordinate transformations,                   matrix manipulations, Jones and Stokes vector treatments of                     polarized light, and Muller and Jones matrix representation of                  optical elements, including polarizers and retarders.  This                     complements selected traditional experiments which are retained                 in interference and diffraction.NSF grant funds are being                       matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
