The equipment will be used in                                     research projects whose goals are to gain a                                     fundamental understanding of the nature of                                      electrically active bulk oxide traps in the gate                                oxides of insulated gate field transistors (IGFETs).                            In particular, this equipment will provide a means                              of determining if the charge free regions observed                              at the SiO2 interfaces of such IGFETs are defect                                free regions or contain defects that can trap                                   electron (or holes) but do not retain these trapped                             carriers due to tunneling from these sites to the                               interface or thermally assisted detrapping.  In                                 addition, this equipment will allow for more                                    accurate measurement of the density and cross                                   section of neutral electron and neutral hole traps by                           providing temperatures low enough to eliminate the                              detrapping which occurs with both of these types of                             traps.  It will also be possible to characterize the                            detrapping associated with the traps using this                                 equipment.",
