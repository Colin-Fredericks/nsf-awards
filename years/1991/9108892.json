 "awd_abstract_narration": "The homeotic genes of Drosophila act as switches selecting the                  developmental pathway a segment will follow. These genes encode                 transcription factors which are thought to specify segment                      identity by regulating other, target genes. The target genes                    would establish individual segmental characteristics. Although                  much is known about the homeotic genes, little is known about the               genes they control or how the homeotic gene products select among               their many target genes. During the past two years, a genetic                   search was undertaken using insertional mutagenesis to tag genes                required for head development. The goal was to identify genes                   regulating or regulated by those homeotic gene products required                to establish proper larval head segment identity. Three genes,                  having expression or phenotypic qualities suggesting they are                   targets of the protein encoded by the homeotic gene, Deformed,                  were chosen for further study. A genetic and molecular                          characterization of these three genes is in progress to determine               their role during development of the larval head. In addition,                  experiments are underway to test whether regulation of Deformed                 is direct. Future experiments will use these genes as models to                 study target gene selection by the homeotic proteins.",
