 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Statistical Association (ASA) proposes to                     consolidate separate ASA/NSF Fellowship Programs with the                       Bureau of Census (Census),  Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),                   and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)  into                   a single program.  This program bridges the gap between                         academic scholars and government social science research.                       Research Fellows and Associates will work on methodological                     problems and policy issues in a Federal statistical agency;                     government social scientists in turn will work with the                         visiting scholars to gain expertise in applying theoretical                     advancements to their work.  Residence at the agencies allows                   for research impossible without direct day-to-day access to                     the Federal agencies' data and human capital resources.  In                     addition,  the proposed consolidation will allow researchers                    to work in more than one agency,  stimulating new research                      applicable to a wide spectrum of statistical programs.                               Historically,  Federal statistical agencies have                           realized significant benefits from on-site research conducted                   by ASA/NSF Fellows and Associates.  Basic scientific                            knowledge also has advanced through the continued                               investigation of methodological and analytical problems                         growing out of their \"hands-on\" experience with these                           agencies.  The planned consolidation of the three original                      Fellowship programs -  Census,  BLS and NCES -  promises to                     enhance the yield of the overall project,  while at the same                    time reducing its cost of operation.",
