 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brooklyn College of the City University of New York                        will carry out a project to upgrade the science preparation                     of elementary teachers.  All students at the College,                           including elementary education majors, are required to                          complete a core science requirement consisting of four 2-                       credit science courses surveying the fields of biology,                         chemistry, physics, and geology.  The project will build                        upon this core to develop five additional courses in                            science content and pedagogy.  The courses will consist of                      an Interdisciplinary Natural Science Course and two pairs                       of education methods and science laboratory courses.  The                       Interdisciplinary Course will provide the preservice                            teacher with a more in-depth learning experience in \"pure                       science\" which cuts across the science disciplines                              involving a variety of topics of interest to the teacher.                       As an example, an Interdisciplinary Course might                                investigate the chemical composition of rocks and minerals,                     the geological structure of the earth, and applications                         from physics involving energy and wave propagation during                       earthquakes.  The education methods/science laboratory pair                     courses will link laboratory study of selected                                  interdisciplinary science topics, such as Urban                                 Environmental Chemistry or Biological Energy, with an                           examination of the various scientific processes of inquiry                      and of the students' learning processes and attitudes.  The                     project also provide workshops and follow-up programs for                       teachers who will serve as mentors for students in the                          program, and the program will be infused with an urban                          multicultural perspective and bolstered by a support system                     for women and minority students.  Brooklyn College's cost-                      sharing will be 33% of NSF's contribution.",
