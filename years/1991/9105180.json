 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Solid State Sciences Committee (SSSC) continues to                     identify and examine issues affecting the health of the field of                materials science in the United States.  Over the past three                    years several SSSC activities have resulted in reports on                       specific topics.  SSSC assessed the field of photonics and                      completed a major study of materials science and engineering.                   The SSSC is nearing completion of a study on diluted magnetic                   semiconductors.  The committee continues periodically to hold a                 forum designed to bring together researchers and Washington                     policy makers.  Much of the committee's efforts over the past                   year have focused on following up the materials study and                       identifying new areas for future attention.                                          The SSSC will continue to respond to the demands of the                    field by completing present projects and beginning new projects                 with similar relevance to the health of materials science and the               solid state sciences.  Materials have been identified by the                    current administration, through OSTP, as an area for a national                 science and technology initiative for the country.  SSSC will                   continue to support the development of this initiative.",
