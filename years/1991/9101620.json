 "awd_abstract_narration": "The measurements of equilibrium and diffusional                                 parameters of gases in microporous solids is very important                     for the design of many separation and catalytic processes.                      These properties are measured by use of the pulse                               chromatography method, which is unique  in that it is a                         macroscopic method that operates under equilibrium conditions.                                                                                                  Comparison of the tracer pulse results with previously                          published NMR diffusion coefficients is used to determine the                   origin of discrepancies commonly observed between the two                       techniques.  Equilibrium isotherms and diffusion data for the                   ethane-silicalite system are measured at various temperatures                   and loadings, allowing investigation of the effect of adsorbed                                                                                                  phase concentration on the micropore diffusion coefficient.                     The effect of co-adsorbed molecules on the diffusional                          behavior of ethane in ideal and nonideal adsorbed mixtures is                   investigated by a modification of the original tracer pulse                     technique.  Equilibrium  isotherms for each component of the                    binary mixtures are also measured by the 'concentration-tracer                                                                                                  pulse' method.  Since industrial applications always involve                    multicomponent systems, a study if diffusion in mixtures is of                                                                                                  great interest.  Finally, two variations of perturbation                        chromatography (tracer and concentration pulse) are used to                     investigate the validity of the Darken equation at various                      adsorbed concentrations.  The tracer-pulse chromatography                       apparatus is unique in this respect, since other experimental                   techniques are not able to measure both the transport and self                                                                                                  diffusion coefficients.",
