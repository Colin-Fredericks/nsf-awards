 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Iowa                State University for the renovation and repair of the                           Microelectronics Research Center which houses that institution's                microelectronics and photonics research and research training                   activities.  This building was constructed in 1962 and currently                its heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system is in the                 process of being updated.  The ARFMP grant of $275,000 and                      $275,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to                modernize these research and research training facilities.  This                project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure both in terms of accessibility and of safety.  This              renovation will permit the expansion of the spectrum of research                and research training activities into areas which heretofore have               been inaccessible.                                                                                                                                              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                   graduate students.  The renovation will permit not only the                     overall expansion of research and research training activities,                 but also relatively greater expansion of those activities for                   undergraduates and women students at all levels.",
