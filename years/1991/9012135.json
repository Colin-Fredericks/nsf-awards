 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flash floods are major meteorological disasters which occur                around the globe.  Understanding of this phenomena is a                         challenging problem because it is necessary to understand both                  complex dynamic and microphysical processes at scales of motion                 that are smaller than typically measured by conventional weather                networks.  This scale of motion is termed mesoscale by                          meteorologists.                                                                      The National Science Council of Taiwan has established a                   Multiple Hazards Mitigation Project whose meteorological                        component is focussed on improving flash flood predictions.  A                  major field project to study the systems that cause flash floods,               entitled the Taiwan Area Mesoscale Experiment, was held in the                  Spring of 1987.  The project was cosponsored by the National                    Science Council with participation of the National Science                      Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric                             Administration of the United States.                                                 The Principal Investigator participated in the field                       expedition and his preliminary research on the data has revealed                the structure of subtropical mesoscale convective systems and the               differences and similarities with mid-latitude systems.  Such                   comparisons have not received much attention in the past.  The                  Principal Investigator will continue this research with special                 attention to comparing the dynamic and thermodynamic                            characteristics of two convective systems that possessed very                   different precipitation characteristics.",
