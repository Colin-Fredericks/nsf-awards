 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the process of turnover in the small                    business sector. The work departs from previous research  in that               rather than treating the business firm alone as the unit of                     analysis, the business firm and the owner are considered together.              Thinking this way leads to a consideration of another aspect of                 firm turnover which has received little attention in the literature             on small businesses, namely, the movement of businesses across                  owners.                                                                                                                                                         The project will employ a new data set collected by the Census                  Bureau called the Characteristics of Business Owners Survey. The                first part of the project will be an unstructured approach to                   uncover the basic patterns in the data with respect to business                 turnover. The second part is to develop a theory which successfully             organizes the data in the sense of being capable of matching the                most significant patterns. The model to be developed will combine               two search processes. The first is the search for good matches                  between businesses and business owners. The second is the search                for businesses of high \"general\" quality.                                                                                                                       The small business sector represents a nonnegligible portion of all             economic activity in the United States. Census figures show that                23 percent of all employment in 1982 was accounted for by firms                 with 19 or fewer employees. Understanding the characteristics of                these businesses is important for estimating the impact of                      government policies, especially the treatment of capital gains and              other tax policy issues.",
