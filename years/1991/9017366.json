 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the development of new methods                for the controlled synthesis of macromolecules.  Specifically,                  attempts will be made to develop solid-state polymerization                     processes to yield polymers that cannot be synthesized by other                 methods.  The work falls into four main topics.  (1) Unsaturated                organic monomer molecules will be clathrated in the molecular level             tunnel systems formed by certain crystalline solids.  The monomers              will then be polymerized in the tunnels by exposure to high energy              irradiation or by chemical initiation.  Stereospecific                          polymerizations are expected in some cases.  (2) Attempts will be               made to prepare one-dimensional metallo-backbone polymers by the                use of the same tunnel clathration technique.  (3) Cyclic                       phosphazenes which crystallize in appropriate crystal packing                   arrangements will be polymerized by gamma-irradiation methods.  It              is expected that this route will generate polymers not accessible               by the conventional thermal melt polymerization route.  (4) Other               cyclic inorganic systems that crystallize in suitable space groups              will also be studied by gamma-irradiation methods.  These systems               include heteroelement phosphazenes, boron-nitrogen-, sulfur-                    nitrogen-, and other heterocyclic rings.  Most of the systems to be             studied have proved to be resistant to conventional thermal ring-               opening polymerization methods.                                                                                                                                 The polymers prepared in this work should have new macromolecular               structures and new combinations of properties that are potentially              useful in electronic, optical, magnetic, and other applications.",
