 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since most lawsuits never go to trial, there is a growing                       literature on the economics of settlement as well as litigation.                In the basic economic models, information is asymmetrically                     distributed among the parties and the timing sequence of settlement             proposals is specified exogenously.  In contrast to such efforts,               new work by Daughety and Reinganum aims to take better account of               the realities of negotiation and settlement by allowing both                    parties to influence the availability of information and the timing             of proposals.  Using models derived from game theory, these                     investigators examine the conditions under which information will               be exchanged and the impact of that information on settlement.                                                                                                  The research specifically focuses on procedural and institutional               design issues relating to the use of information in pre-trial                   bargaining in civil cases.  The extended model allows for voluntary             disclosure of information, for uncertain liability and damages, and             for the strategic use of the discovery process.  Also, it permits               analyzing the effects of making pre-trial negotiations admissible               evidence in court, the effects of liability and damage rules on the             settlement process, and the effects on the settlement process of                countersuits by the defendant and multiple suits against the                    defendant.  As conceptualized, this modelling promises to explore               both a richer set of informational assumptions and a broader range              of procedural devices than heretofore exists on litigation and                  settlement.  In real-life conditions for settlement, exchange of                information and strategic decisions by both parties are subject to              a variety of discovery and liability rules.  This effort holds                  promise of capturing these dynamics and moving beyond the highly                stylized models of the pre-trial process.",
