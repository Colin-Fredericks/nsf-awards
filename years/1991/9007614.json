 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary or genealogical relationships in flowering                    plants are often poorly understood at taxonomic levels above the                rank of genus.  These difficulties presumably reflect the more                  frequent occurrence of convergent or parallel evolution in                      morphological characters at higher taxonomic levels.  Although                  numerous examples of this exist, one of the most problematic is                 the Saxifragaceae family, including the gooseberries, hydrangeas,               and saxifrages.  As originally defined, this family consists of a               diverse array of herbaceous and woody plants distributed                        throughout the world and placed into 15-17 subfamilies.  Little                 agreement exists among plant systematists regarding the                         circumscription, taxonomic rank (subfamily, family), or                         relationships of these various groups.  The taxonomic complexity                involved in dealing with the Saxifragaceae also requires a                      thorough analysis of the large order Rosales, of which it is a                  member.                                                                                                                                                              It has become clear in recent years that DNA sequence                      comparisons can be particularly helpful in determining                          evolutionary relationships at higher taxonomic levels.  Dr.                     Douglas Soltis of Washington State University is studying                       nucleotide sequence variation among a large sample of species of                Saxifragaceae, focusing upon the photosynthesis-related gene                    rbcL.  A broad analysis of rbcL sequence data will help clarify                 relationships within Saxifragaceae and in conjunction with data                 being generated in several other laboratories will contribute to                determination of phylogenetic affinities among the rosalean                     dicots.  The resulting phylogeny will then provide an                           evolutionary framework for interpreting change in morphological                 and chemical characteristics of these plants, and for informing                 their historical biogeography.",
