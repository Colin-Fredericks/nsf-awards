 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental study addresses the influence of iron                         additives on soot-particle morphology in laminar, coannular,                    ethylene/air diffusion flames.  The primary objective of the                    work is to determine both state and morphology of the additive                  species within the combustion environment, as well as their                     dependence on flame coordinates.  Other fundamental issues to                   be addressed include whether the additive intervenes at an                      early or late combustion stage, to determine if iron                            combustion products are occluded in the soot phase, and in                      case they are, to examine their incorporation within the                        carbon matrix as a function of flame location.  The                             incorporation of iron combustion products within the soot                       phase (if present) will be quantified through an elemental                      analysis of the particulate phase collected from various flame                  locations.  A recently developed intrusive sampling technique                   winl be used in conjunction with transmission electron                          microscopy to provide the samples for morphological and                         elemental characterization of the particulate phase within the                  flames.                                                                                                                                                         The proposed fundamental research would contribute to a better                  understanding of the metal-additive influence on the basic                      mechanisms involved in the formation, growth, oxidation and                     emission of soot from laboratory, well-defined flames.  Our                     ability to resolve these issues may define new ways to enhance                  and optimize fuel-additive use for soot suppression.",
