 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing psychological theories portray the domain of morality as               extending beyond justice considerations to encompass                            interpersonal responsibilities (i.e. obligations to be responsive               to the needs of family and friends).  They generally assume,                    however, that universally individuals conceptualize interpersonal               responsibilities as matters of personal choice rather than as                   socially sanctionable duties.  This research examines cultural                  influences on the moral status of interpersonal responsibilities.               Three experimental studies will be conducted assessing American                 and Hindu Indian adults' and childrens' (second grade and sixth                 grade) interpretations of obligations to help needy others.  The                research is expected to demonstrate that Americans tend to hold a               relatively voluntaristic \"relationship-based\" perspective on                    interpersonal responsibilities, in which commitments to others                  are seen as capable of being voluntarily abandoned, not                         personally demanding and as dependent, in part, on whether or not               the agent likes the other.  In contrast, it will be shown that                  Indians tend to hold a less voluntaristic \"role-based\"                          perspective, in which commitments to others are seen as based on                unalterable role expectations, potentially personally demanding                 and as unrelated to the agent's liking of the other.  The                       investigation will make a theoretical contribution to social                    psychology in its demonstration that conceptions of interpersonal               responsibilities are culturally patterned rather than universal.                In identifying a system of interpersonal morality that has not                  been previously recognized within psychology, the project will                  also serve to expand current knowledge regarding the scope of the               moral domain.  Finally, in contrasting the reasoning of different               age groups of children from markedly different cultures, the                    research will enhance current understanding of the processes                    underlying social cognitive development.",
