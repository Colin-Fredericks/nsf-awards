 "awd_abstract_narration": "NACME proposes to develop a 20 minute videotape, with a                    teacher's guide and student brochure, that will use career                      opportunities in engineering as a vehicle to encourage math and                 science course-taking among minority high school students.  By                  introducing engineering careers as dynamic, exciting                            professions that offer excellent prospects for minority                         graduates, NACME hopes to motivate students to take academic                    track science and math courses beginning at the 8th/9th grade                   crossroads and continuing through high school graduation.                                                                                                            The video, geared specifically to a primary audience of 11                 to 14 year-old minority students (5th through 8th graders) and                  a secondary audience of non-minority students, parents,                         teachers and guidance counselors, will focus on the lives of                    successful young engineers, male and female, from diverse                       ethnic backgrounds.",
