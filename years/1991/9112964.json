 "awd_abstract_narration": "Until the difficulty and tedium of the experimental method is                   reduced, the surface forces apparatus will remain a tool in                     the hands of a few dedicated specialists rather than a                          mainstay technique in colloid and interface science.  Fifteen                   years after its development, researchers continue to measure                    the positions, and thereby wavelengths, of the low intensity                    interference fringes by eye; a process that takes at least six                  months of practice to master, as it must be, if surface                         separation is to be determined accurately and precisely to                      within one angstrom.  Even then, the resolution of the                          measurement is ultimately limited by the physical abilities                     and stamina of the researcher.  In this proposal, we request                    funds to develop a high perfomance imaging and control system                   for the surface apparatus that provides for automation of the                   force measurement with resolution greater than currently                        possible.  The system will be used in conjunction with our                      surface forces apparatus to investigate the structure and                       stability of ultrathin organic films.",
