 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimal Filtering is a statistical signal processing problem of                 major engineering importance.  Historically, the most frequently                used signal processing tools have been linear in nature, but                    despite rich linear systems theories, many signal processing                    problems have not been satisfactorily addressed through the use of              linear schemes.  This research aims at the theoretical development              of a large class of non-linear filters which are based in                       combination of either the observation vector, the sorted                        observation vector, or in general a non-linear transformation of                the observation vector.  Thus, we achieve non-linear filter                     response characteristics but with the machinery of linear systems               theory available for their optimization and design.  The optimal                solution requires the statistical characterization of the set of                decomposed signals (micro-statistics).  The filtering problem                   reduces to a set of filters operating on the decomposed signals                 (micro-statistic filters) where the output is a weighted sum of the             decomposed filtered signals.  In this work, a theory will be                    developed for robust micro-statistic filters in which linear                    operations are executed in a sorted observation vector.  For                    environments with unknown or non-stationary characteristics, we                 develop adaptive micro-statistic filters and address issues such                as convergence, lattice structures, fast algorithms, and                        complexity.",
