 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daniel Ben-Avraham is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                 and Computational Chemistry Program and the Materials Theory                    Program to study diffusion-limited reactions and heterogeneous                  catalysis.  This research will help to elucidate the mechanism                  of heterogeneous catalysis which is important in the                            manufacture of a variety of chemicals including fuels, plastics                 and other synthetic materials.                                                                                                                                  Dr. Ben-Avraham will conduct a detailed theoretical and                         numerical study of the kinetics of nonequilibrium processes,                    namely, diffusion-limited reactions and heterogeneous                           catalysis.  Diffusion-limited reactions are the                                 rate-determining step in heterogeneous catalysis, as well as in                 several other important processes such as carrier-hole                          recombination in semiconductors, and the formation of colloids                  and aerosols.  The theoretical research to be performed by Dr.                  Ben-Avraham will focus on the kinetic effects of                                inhomogeneities on a microscopic scale as opposed to the                        traditional phenomonological approach which relies on rate                      equations that use system averages as variables.  The results                   of this research will yield a better theoretical understanding                  of nonequilibrium kinetics and heterogeneous catalysts.",
