 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change               Research Program (Our Changing Planet,\" Committee on Earth                      Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                      environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                    Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                     Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                 initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                 of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                  properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                 geospace model with predictive capability.                                           The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                             magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                   connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                   ionosphere.  Recent observation suggest that waves generated in                 the vicinity of the magnetopause and boundary layer regions may                 be transported into the polar cusp.  THis grant involves the                    study of compressional wave propagation from a generation region                near the magnetopause into the polar cusp and an examination of                 the instabilities associated with ion injected into the polar                   cusp from the magnetosheat.  For both studies a primary                         consideration will be to compare the results with observed                      magnetic pulsation signatures.",
