 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Groundwater Hydrology project will establish a model                        laboratory component to undergraduate hydrology courses in which                basic principles of fluid flow and contaminant transport in                     porous media are presented.  In addition to receiving classroom                 instruction, students will quantify and observe fundamental flow                and solute transport processes in both the laboratory and field.                Students will also participate in the numerical simulation of                   these processes.                                                                                                                                                Flow-through porous media apparatuses will be constructed for a                 variety of flow geometries.  Experiments will be instrumented                   with pressure transducers and specific ion electrodes.  Students                will investigate Darcian flow, aquifer field tests and solute                   transport in homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media.  A                     computer data acquisition system will allow for simultaneous                    readings and data storage.  A high-speed microcomputer will                     allow rapid graphical representation of data and numerical                      simulation experiments.                                                                                                                                         The project is unique in that engineering hydrology at the                      undergraduate level has traditionally incorporated analytical-                  based laboratory exercises.  This state-of-the-art groundwater                  hydrology course will serve as a model for engineering programs.                Undergraduates seeking degrees in the areas of water resources,                 environmental and geotechnical engineering will have a unique                   opportunity to experience laboratory and field experimentation                  combined with numerical simulation of flow and transport                        processes in the subsurface.",
