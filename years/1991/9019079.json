This event  is the first truly international                      scientific gathering in this field,  with roughly equal                         participation from the U.S. and Western Europe,  as well as                     participants from elsewhere in North and South America,                         Eastern Europe,  Asia,  Africa,  Australia,  Oceania,  and                      the Near East.                                                                       The purpose of the conference is to strengthen                             collaborative comparative research across both national and                     disciplinary boundaries.  The grant is to provide support for                   travel by U.S. participants to the conference.  In the                          selection of awardees, the co-sponsors (the Law and Society                     Association and the International Sociological Association)                     have assigned first priority to younger scholars (both those                    who are about to receive their Ph.Ds. and those of have                         received them recently).                                                             Most social scientific studies of law in the United                        States have focussed on \"common law\" institutions as they                       have evolved in this country.  The potential for advancing                      knowledge through comparative studies with other common law                     systems,  with civil law systems,  and with other forms is                      great.  Moreover,  with legal and social structures changing                    so markedly in many parts of the world,  the cross-cultural                     research,  stimulated by the conference, should take on an                      added timeliness and significance.",
