 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides 50% funding for the development of a                   logging tool for temperature versus depth measurements in deep and              hot drillholes. The logging tool will be developed by the PI in the             Department of Geological Sciences at Southern Methodist University.             SMU is committed to providing the rest of the funding required for              this project.                                                                        Use of present equipment to measure heat flow through the                  Earth's crust is severely limited in depth and temperature, mainly              because of the use of electric cabling to transmit back to the                  surface. Consequently, few research quality temperature logging                 tools can be used at more than 450K and 3 kilometers. This project              will adapt downhole computer and cryogenic technology to develop                a temperature logging tool that is more accurate than existing ones             and capable of operating up to 650K and 5 kilometers. Such                      measurements are needed to interpret the heat flow from the                     interior and its role in the Earth's thermal budget.",
