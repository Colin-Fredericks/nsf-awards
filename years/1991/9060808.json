 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of integrated design and manufacturing                     systems is widely recognized as a critical component in the                     effort to improve the competitive posture of American industries.               A key to the success of these computer integrated manufacturing                 systems lies in the robustness of the information integration                   supported by the systems.  However, the individual methods                      available to support the definition and design of current                       information systems are not themselves sufficiently integrated                  with one another to permit the cost effective development of                    complex real world systems.  The goal of this research is to                    provide the necessary theoretical and computational foundations                 for overcoming this problem.  Its practical upshot will be the                  development of automated support for a seamless suite of                        methodologies to achieve integrated information systems in                      design, engineering, and manufacturing.",
