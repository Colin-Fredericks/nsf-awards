 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research                         project in chemical dynamics between two groups at the                          University of Chicago and two groups at the Institute for                       Molecular Science, Okazaki.  Professors Graham R. Fleming and                   Jeffrey A. Cina will work with Professors Keitaro Yoshihara                     and Iwao Ohmine and their associates on studies of chemical                     dynamics in solution.  The studies combine ultrafast                            spectroscopy with theory and simulation and are aimed at                        building up a detailed understanding of how solvents influence                  the rate and outcome of chemical reactions.  Such reactions                     are often modeled as occuring on simple one- dimensional                        potential surfaces.  The other degrees of freedom - in-                         tramolecular vibrations are either modeled statistically or                     simply ignored.  The roles of the solvent in modifying the                      potential surface and in influencing motion along it are                        generally regarded as distinct (\"static\" and \"dynamic\").  The                   development of a more realistic description of simple                           chemical processes such as photochemical isomerization is                       hampered by ignorance of vibrational dynamics, of the true                      potential surface, and of the various time scales of the                        solvent response.  The goal of this collaborative project is                    to combine the experimental and theoretical strengths of the                    groups at the U.S. and Japanese institutions to specifically                    address these questions.                                                                                                                                        The experimental programs at both Chicago and Okazaki represent                 the state of the art.  They are complementary in several                        ways.  The groups at Chicago have developed fluorescence                        spectroscopy further than the Okazaki groups, while the                         Okazaki groups have developed unique femtosecond studies of                     clusters.  The FSCAR and Raman spectroscopies require                           different set-ups and will give complementary information.                      The use of very large scale computing to combine electronic                     structure and dynamical modeling is well developed at Okazaki                   and the enormous computing power available there will allow                     calculations that could not be contemplated in the United                       States.  It will be of great value to see how such calculations                 influence the thinking of experimentalists.  Both the U.S.                      and the Japanese groups possess great strength in analytical                    studies of condensed phase dynamics and again, the exposure                     to the large computer calculations in Japan will be most                        valuable to the American groups.  Finally, as an important part                 of the project, two U.S. graduate students will participate in                  the study, spending time each year in the Japanese laborator-                   ies.",
