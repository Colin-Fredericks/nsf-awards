 "awd_abstract_narration": "A laboratory for image processing and analysis is being                         established to train undergraduates in electrical engineering,                  computer science and the natural sciences in the analysis of                    natural images and scientific data. The lab consists of three                   networked computer workstations with specialized equipment and                  software for the acquisition and processing of digital images                   from photographs and video sources. This enables students to                    gain practical programming experience with scientific imaging                   topics like photometrics, two-dimensional signal processing,                    statistical pattern recognition, machine vision and parallel                    algorithms for multidimensional data processing and storage;                    these topics prepare students to apply and write software for                   increasingly important computer applications like biomedical                    imaging, remote sensing, robotics, and scientific                               visualization. To support the specialized hardware faculty are                  preparing a workbook of graded exercises based on a set of                      high-quality public domain image processing packages and data                   sets; this software and workbook can be freely disseminated,                    and run on a single inexpensive personal computer.NSF grant                     funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
