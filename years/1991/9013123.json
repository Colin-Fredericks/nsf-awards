 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal covers two types of activities: 1) the                       management of the AEROCE scientific program; 2) the management of               operations at the Secondary Network stations at Barbados and                    Izania.                                                                              The PI carries out his management duties in his capacity as                chairman of the AEROCE Executive Committee which is comprised of                three PI's from the AEROCE program.  A Scientific Advisory                      Committee (SAC) composed of independent scientists provides                     oversight.  The SAC reviews ongoing activities and assesses the                 future direction of the program. The SAC meets with all PI's at                 least once a year at the AEROCE annual meeting.                                      As Chairman of the Executive Committee, the PI: 1) serves as               the spokesperson for AEROCE when dealing with foreign                           governments; 2) is the principal liaison with cooperating                       research groups; 3) is the primary interface with international                 programs such as IGAC and JGOPS.                                                     The University of Miami (UM) manages the stations in the                   Secondary Network.  At present, the UM is operating Barbados,                   Mace Head and Izania.  As network operator, the UM is responsible               for all aspects of maintaining the network station operator, the                UM is responsible for all aspects of maintaining the network                    station operations.  This includes equipment design, maintenance                and repair, maintaining liaison with the station operators,                     ensuring QA/QC, distribution samples to other PI's and archiving                station data.",
