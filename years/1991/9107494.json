 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three detection systems which have been developed in part at               the University of Denver will be further developed and                          investigated in terms of their ability to determine the flux of                 species to and from the atmosphere.  Long-path UV (LPUV)                        spectroscopy will be coupled with long-path IR (LPIR)                           spectroscopy and used to determine the fluxes of various species.               A fast response in-situ total sulfur monitor will also be                       optimized for response speed and sensitivity.  It will be used                  for flux studies by means of the eddy-correlation technique.                    Some of the flux studies will be carried out in collaboration                   with the NCAR ASTER facility and Argonne National Laboratory.                        An atmospheric pressure flow system, free radical detector                 has been developed which is shown to respond to concentrations of               HO2 and RO2 radicals.  This apparatus, named PERCA (PEroxy                      Radical detector using Chemical Amplification) has been shown to                respond to a number of hydrocarbon and oxygenated hydrocarbon                   peroxy radicals up to C8.  Using the PERCA, further studies will                be conducted to overcome the inability to obtain stable                         calibrations.",
