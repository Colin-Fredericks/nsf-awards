 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most asset pricing theories relate expected returns on assets to                their conditional variances and covariances.  An enormous                       literature in empirical finance has documented that these                       conditional moments change over time.  Practical experience as in               the 1929 and 1987 stock market crashes reinforces this                          conclusion.  Unfortunately, conditional covariances are not                     directly observable.  In tests of asset pricing theories,                       researchers must use estimates of conditional second moments.                   Similarly, market participants use estimates of conditional                     variances and covariances in hedging, option pricing, and in many               other aspects of portfolio selection.  This projects addresses                  the following important questions:  How accurate are the                        estimated variances and covariances?  How can they be estimated                 more accurately?  How severely do the inevitable measurement                    errors affect portfolio selection and tests of asset pricing                    theories?                                                                                                                                                       Researchers doing empirical work in finance have adopted many                   strategies for accommodating changes in conditional variances and               covariances.  Among the popular strategies are: (1) chopping the                available data into short blocks of time and assuming                           homoskedasticity within the blocks, (b) one-sided rolling                       regressions, in which only data from, say, the preceding five                   year period is used to estimate the conditional covariance of                   returns at a given date, (c) two-sided rolling regressions, in                  which covariances are estimated for each date using, say, five                  years of lags and five years of leads, and (d) Autoregressive                   Conditional Heteroscedatic (ARCH) models.  The choice between                   these methods has traditionally been ad hoc, since no theory has                been available to compare their relative efficiency in settings.                This project addresses this problem by developing continuous                    record asymptotic approximations for the measurement errors when                methods (a) through (d) are used.",
