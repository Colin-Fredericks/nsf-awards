 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to understand the interaction                  of combustion and shear layer control techniques.  The                          proposal is to study the fluid mechanics of combustion of a                     small aspect ratio rectangular channel sudden expansion.  This                  configuration utilizes a combination of several control                         techniques.  Active forcing will be used to drive the system's                  acoustic resonances and to organize the shear layer vortical                    structures for phase locked analysis.  Passive forcing will be                  introduced via the configuration geometry; the elliptic vortex                  rings formed in the shear layer undergo self-induction,                         deforming the jet cross section and introducing transverse                      velocities not found in plane and axi-symmetric                                 configurations.  The approach is experimental, using laser                      doppler anemometry and flow visualization to examine the                        velocity field and premixed flame in a rectangular sudden                       expansion.  The equivalence ratio will range from lean, where                   the stabilization of the flame in the shear layer downstream                    of the backward facing step is affected by the passive, active                  and three dimensional control techniques, to rich, where the                    flame/flow interaction is dominated by acoustic resonances.                     This will allow determination of the extent to which these                      control methods are effective in this configuration.  The                       study will be initially limited to premixed combustion.  The                    results can later be extended to address issues in nonpremixed                  combustion such as the optimization of fuel injection                           locations to take advantage of the flowfields produced by the                   control techniques.                                                                                                                                             This research is expected to have a significant impact on                       combustion applications ranging from industrial pulse                           combustors and toxic waste incinerators to subsonic and                         supersonic combustion in ramjets.  The understanding of the                     effects of shear layer control techniques on mixing and                         combustion can produce immediate results in increased                           combustion efficiency and control.",
