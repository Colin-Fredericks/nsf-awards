A Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic                  Resonance facility will be established for use in undergraduate                 instrumental analysis courses and by research students enrolled                 in the four colleges in the City of Memphis.  The center will                   be located at Memphis State University, which will provide the                  matching funds and provide for maintenance of the facility (and                 will, therefore, retain title to the facility and arrange a                     schedule for its use).  However the center will also provide                    for the instructional and research needs at three smaller                       colleges: LeMoyne Owen College, Christian Brothers College and                  Rhodes College.  The integration of C-13 FT NMR (along with the                 possibility of running coupled, decoupled, off-resonance                        decoupled, 2-D experiments, etc.)  into the undergraduate                       curriculum will fill a glaring need in molecular spectroscopy                   in all of the Memphis area institutions and also provide for                    routine spectral characterization of compounds generated in                     undergraduate research projects.  The inclusion of LeMoyne-Owen                 College, a historically Black liberal arts college, in the                      project, as well as the sizable percentage of minorities at the                 other institutions, ensures that the facility will provide for                  enhanced educational opportunities for minority students.",
