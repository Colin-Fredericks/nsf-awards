 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantitative analysis of economic data has become a central                     component of both public and private sector decision making.                    This project establishes a Computer Laboratory for Quantitative                 Economic Analysis in order to provide students with hands-on                    data analysis opportunities in six undergraduate quantitative                   economics courses.  Housed within the Department's Economics                    Resource Center (a faculty supervised learning center staffed                   by students) the Laboratory will promote creative explorations                  in applied economic analysis, eschewing the traditional drills                  and rote exercises.  By encouraging original student research                   projects, the Laboratory will enrich student understanding of                   economic modeling and estimation techniques.  Exploiting the                    capabilities of personal computers and powerful statistical and                 mathematical software, students will gain proficiency in                        applying analytical tools to a wide range of complex micro and                  macro-economic issues.  The overlapping use of hardware,                        software and data bases across the introductory and advanced                    quantitative economics classes will offer students a                            progressive learning environment in which to gain ever more                     sophisticated analytical skills.  Data collection and                           management skills will likewise be nurtured in the learning                     process.The award will be matched by an equal sum from the                      grantee.",
