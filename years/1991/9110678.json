 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Research Initiation Award                                 project is to develop an optical pulse compressor that                          can be used with high power lasers, does not add to                             amplitude noise or timing jitter, and has very high                             throughput efficiency while providing pulse                                     compression ratios in the range of 10 to 100.  Current                          optical pulse compression technology is based on                                chirping pulses in single mode optical fibers by the                            nonlinear effect of self-phase modulation.  Although                            high pulse compression ratios have been                                         demonstrated, the utility of the technique is limited                           because of inherent tradeoffs between input power,                              pulsewidth, and fiber length.  In addition, fiber                               coupling losses, induced polarization wandering, and                            thermal and acoustical interference all combine to                              create amplitude noise and long term power drift.                               We propose to impart the chirp on the pulses actively                           with high modulation index electro-optic phase                                  modulators.  The advantages to this approach are                                that the chirping mechanism does not depend on the                              nature of the input optical pulse, only the quality of                          the electrical drive signal to the modulator, which can                         be extremely good.  We envision the pulse                                       compressor to take the form of dielectric loaded                                microwave or millimeter wave resonators driven by                               highly stable synthesizers and clean power amplifiers                           and followed by grating-pair or prism dispersive delay                          lines.  The efforts of the research will be directed at                         determination the optimum microwave cavity                                      geometries and electro-optic dielectric materials for                           the particular input optical pulse characteristics.  This                       device should have a major impact on the research                               efforts in ultrafast phenomena since it can be                                  universally applied to all modelocked laser sources,                            independent of their power.  Since large frame, high                            average power lasers are frequently used as pump                                sources for other lasers or nonlinear frequency                                 converters, their performance will be similarly                                 enhanced.",
