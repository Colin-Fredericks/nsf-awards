 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: Under this project support is provided for                         collaboration between Dr. S. Ahmed of the School of                             Oceanography, University of Washington, and Dr. G. S.                           Quraishee, Director Emeritus of the National Institute of                       Oceanography (NIO) in Karachi, Pakistan.  The research                          deals with the interaction of the elements of the web of                        mangrove systems, especially in the system at the mouth of                      the Indus river in Pakistan, to understand the impact of                        factors such as the decrease in fresh water flow and                            increase in ground water salinity on the growth of trees                        and the chain reaction on other marine life in the mangrove                     ecosystem.  In Pakistani mangrove ecosystems the result has                     been expressed in vastly decreased species diversity of the                     halophytes and in shorter shrubs.  The full understanding                       of the ecophysiology of the mangrove ecosystems and an                          order of importance of its elements is needed to affect a                       reversal of the loss in this natural resource.                                                                                                                  Scope: This research is being carried out by the U. of                          Washington team with the participation of the NIO staff                         which also provides the boats and other logistical                              support.  The participation in the data analysis and even                       in data acquisition will be enhanced through this project                       to the benefit of the U.S. team and also to the Pakistani                       team.  The latter will develop the necessary capabilities                       and expertise to continue the reserach beyond the                               involvement of the Americans.  The project fits the                             objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program.                      This project is being funded jointly by INT and OCE.",
