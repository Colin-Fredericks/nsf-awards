 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of               the Chemistry Division, spectroscopic studies will be performed to              investigate the effects of a solvent on the electronic states of                several small molecules.  Both time-dependent and steady-state                  techniques will be used, including picosecond pump-probe                        absorption kinetics and resonance Raman spectroscopy.  Past work                has explored the molecules in the gas phase, but the proposed                   experiments will concentrate on the condensed phase.  The time-                 resolved experiments will help illuminate some of the dynamic                   aspects of the solvent-solute interactions.  Data will be used to               critically test and extend existing theoretical models.  The range              of spectroscopic techniques to be used will provide information on              many aspects of the systems under study.                                        %%%                                                                             This study of the differences in properties of species in the gas               phase versus in solution is novel in that it concentrates on small              molecules, which are more tractable to theoretical analysis and                 prediction than the large molecules commonly studied                            spectroscopically in solution.  Furthermore, the liquid-phase                   results can be compared with existing gas-phase data to determine               what changes in properties occur in the condensed medium.  These                studies are important since a large fraction of all biologically,               environmentally, and technologically important chemistry occurs in              liquids.",
