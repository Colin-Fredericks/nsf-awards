 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project consists of a detailed, regional                               chronostratigraphic, sedimentologic, and sequence stratigraphic                 analysis of nonmarine rocks in the Upper Jurassic - Lower                       Cretaceous Morrison, Cloverly, and Kootenai Formations and the                  equivalent strata of the Gannett Group.  In order to integrate                  sequence stratigraphic analysis with the marine record of the                   foreland basin, the study will include bounding marine rocks in the             Sundance (Jurassic) and Thermopolis (Cretaceous) Formations.  Areas             of data collection include the Powder River basin and Black HIlls,              the Idaho-Wyoming thrust belt, and the area surrounding Great Falls             in west-central Montana.                                                             Detailed facies analysis, point counts of petrographic thin                sections and conglomerate clast counts, outcrop mapping of fluvial              channel complexes, subsurface-to-surface correlations of                        geophysical well logs, detailed magnetostratigraphy, and fission-               track dating of euhedral zircons from selected ash-rich horizons                will be performed.                                                                   The principal results of this data base will be a complete                 chrono - and lithostratigraphic framework for the Morrison-Cloverly             sequence and its equivalents to the west and north of Wyoming.  The             Data base will span an area covering - 250,000 km , from the                    proximal part of the basin to near its eastern terminus.  Among                 other important results will be (1) a sequence - stratigraphic                  framework for nonmarine rocks in both underfilled and overfilled                parts of foreland basins; (2) a new chronostratigraphically                     controlled model for early filling of the Cordilleran foreland                  basin; and (3) new and more complete understanding of the extrinsic             (tectonic, eustatic, climatic) controls on the early Cordilleran                foreland basin.  The results also will provide one of the largest               data bases for comparison with available and developing geophysical             models for foreland basins.",
