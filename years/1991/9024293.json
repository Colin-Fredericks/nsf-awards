 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will lead to new information regarding the                molecular processes by which animals respond to environmental                   change.  The model system employed is the euryhaline crab, an                   animal capable of adjusting to broad changes of salinity, at the                same time maintaining a relatively constant salt level in the                   blood.  The process by which the crab regulates its blood salt                  includes two transport systems at opposite ends of the cells making             up the gill lining.  One system brings sodium ions into the cell                from the ambient water, in exchange for hydrogen ions, thus helping             to regulate the acid-base status as well as the ionic level of the              animal.  The other system pumps sodium ions from the cell into the              blood, this time in exchange for potassium or ammonium ion.  A                  similar mechanism operates in the mammalian kidney, retaining                   sodium ions while hydrogen ions and ammonium ions are excreted.                 The advantage of studying the crab is that the animal naturally                 experience wide fluctuations in demand on the sodium transport                  systems.  The approach will be to examine the molecular responses               of the crab to salinity change, including changes in the synthesis              or degradation of specific RNA and protein molecules.  Both the                 sodium/hydrogen ion exchanger and the sodium/potassium pump will                receive detailed attention in the research program.//",
