 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North American fish fauna provides an informative,                      natural laboratory useful in investigations of comparative,                     evolutionary, and -- phylogenetic relationships.  Without these                 data the fauna is rendered inaccessible for direct estimates of                 community formation, evolutionary ecology, and modes and rates of               speciation.  Fishes of the family Percidae represent one of the                 most diverse groups in North America, yet relationships among                   many of the species are poorly known.  The objectives of this                   study are to test previous biogeographic and evolutionary                       relationships hypothesis for several darter species, using starch               gel electrophoresis and phylogenetic analyses.  Relationships                   within and between the target species are extremely useful in                   resolving recently constructed area (river) cladograms for many                 drainages in eastern North America that dated the origin of the                 fauna well before the Pleistocene.  The study will focus on two                 wide-spread species of the percid genus Etheostoma, the                         relationships of species within the subgenus Etheostoma (genus                  Etheostoma), and the phyletic affinities of this clade to the                   subgenus Ulocentra (or Nanostoma).  The potential gains of the                  study are not restricted to revised taxonomy and relationships of               traditionally confusing group.  The analysis will supply both a                 framework for future systematic studies in percid fishes and                    improve our understanding of evolutionary biology.",
