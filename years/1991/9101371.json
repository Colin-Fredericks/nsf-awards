 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will continue his               study of several problems related to the stability and                          bifurcation of time-dependent solutions of amplitude equations                  arising in fluid dynamics.  In particular, he will investigate                  the Ginzburg-Landau equation from the theory of hydrodynamic                    stability theory and the Zakharov system of equations from the                  theory of weak plasma turbulence.  In addition, the principal                   investigator will consider these two sets of equations in their                 nonlinear Schroedinger limits.  The method of attack will be a                  combined analytical and numerical approach that seeks to derive                 asymptotic versions of the equations that are tractable and that                contain the essential physics of the phenomena being modelled.                       Much of the natural phenomena of everyday life involves what               mathematicians and physicists call \"stability and bifurcation\"                  phenomena.  That is, a system will continue more or less in a                   stable mode of operation until it is perturbed sufficiently to                  the point where a new type of behavior arises out of the old one.               When this happens one says that a \"bifurcation\" has occurred and                one is then interested in the \"stability\" of the new solution.                  That is, how long will the new mode of behavior exist and how                   large of a perturbation will it take to kick the system into a                  new mode of behavior?  In this project the principal investigator               will examine such problems as they arise in the modelling of                    plasmas and turbulence by using analytical and numerical methods.",
