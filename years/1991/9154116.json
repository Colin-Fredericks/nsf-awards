 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1983 the President inaugurated the National Partnerships in                  Education program and requested that each federal agency                        establish a partnership with a local school.  NSF formed a                      partnership with Banneker High School which has a special                       emphasis in science and mathematics.  The Foundation has                        initiated a variety of activities with the school centering on                  staff and outside speaker presentations and trips to science                    facilities.  This year the staff in the Directorate for Education               and Human Resources assisted Banneker faculty and staff in the                  identification of \"critical needs\" in the school's science and                  mathematics programs.  As a result the school is being awarded a                grant of $63,000 to upgrade science laboratory equipment,                       purchase materials and supplies and implement staff development                 activities.",
