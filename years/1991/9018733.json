 "awd_abstract_narration": "Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (hereafter Ecc) and most                   other soft-rot Erwinia spp. produce an assortment of                            extracellular degradative enzymes such as pectin lyase (Pnl),                   pectate lyase (Pel), polygalacturonase (Peh), cellulase, protease               and phospholipase.  A long-term goal of our research is to                      clarify the genetic and physiological aspects of extracellular                  enzyme production in soft-rot Erwinia and to elucidate the role                 of these enzymes in bacterial plant pathogenicity.  We have shown               that while pectinolytic (Pnl) and pectolytic (Pel and Peh)                      enzymes cause maceration of plant tissue, they are regulated                    differently.  In contrast to pectolytic enzymes, most of which                  are induced by catabolic products of polygalacturonate or pectin,               Pnl is induced by DNA-damaging agents such as mitomycin C,                      nalidixic acid, or ultraviolet light.  In Ecc strain 71 (Ecc71)                 the induction of pnlA, the pectin lyase structural gene, by these               DNA-damaging agents requires products of recA and an activator                  gene, digR (= regulator of damage-inducible genes).  These                      products also appear to control bacteriocin (carotovoricin, Ctv)                production and cellular lysis in this bacterium.  We have                       reconstituted and inducible Pnl system in a RecA+ E. coli strain                carrying a pnlA+ plasmid and a digR+ plasmid.  The E. coli strain               responds to the same regulatory signals as the Ecc71 Pnl                        producing system.  Moreover, our recent findings indicate that                  digR and not pnlA is induced by DNA damaging agents in a RecA+                  LexA+ E. coli.  These observations suggest a cascade type of                    regulation wherein a regulatory gene (digR), required for the                   transcription of pnlA and possibly other damage-inducible genes,                is controlled by DNA damaging agents.  The objectives of this                   research are (a) to identify and characterize upstream DNA                      segments of pnlA that regulate transcription, (b) to characterize               the activator gene, digR and to identify its product, (c) to                    elucidate the expression of digR, and (d) to understand the                     mechanism by which DigR activates pnlA transcription.  In these                 studies we intend to utilize genetic and molecular technologies                 and various tools already available in E. coli and in Ecc71.  The               emerging knowledge should help in defining the regulatory circuit               and in understanding the molecular events in the expression of a                plant virulence factor by DNA-damaging agents.",
