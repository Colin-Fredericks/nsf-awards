 "awd_abstract_narration": "The successful pregnancy requires careful orchestratation of fetal              development and maternal physiology.  Many of these changes may be              coordinated by placental hormones, which are in a unique position               to alter both maternal and fetal physiology.  The bovine placenta               secretes a family of placental prolactin-related hormones which may             assist or replace the pituitary hormones during pregnancy.  Despite             the obvious relationship of these hormones to prolactin, the                    placental hormones are very distinct from the pituitary hormones                and one another in amino acid sequence, differing by 50-65%.  These             include bovine placental lactogen (bPL), which was identified by                binding to prolactin and growth hormone receptors, and a diverse                subfamily which does not interact with these characterized                      recepors, including bPRCl.  As part of a long term effect to                    investigate the function and mechanism of action of these placental             hormones in this bovine model system, attention will be focused of              bPL and bPRCI.  Specific high affinity binding sites for each these             hormones have been identified.  The plan is to characterize bPL                 receptor protein(s) and localize their target cells.  The copy DNAs             corresponding to the receptor proteins from a model target tissue               will be isolated and cloned.  These will then be used to                        investigate other target tissues.  Taken together, these studies                will increase understanding of the hormone and tissue specific                  actions of this gene family, and provide the tools to begin to                  examine the function of these placental hormones in the controlled              proliferation and maternal adaptions which occur during pregnancy.",
