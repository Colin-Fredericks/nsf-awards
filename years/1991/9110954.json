 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing tools for program development are based on a perceived                 requirement to support programming in conventional languages -                  languages often biased toward batch translation.  Yet integrated                development environments can hide many of the idiosyncrasies of                 conventional programming languages, provided only that the emphasis on          conventional languages is relaxed.                                                  Semantically founded programming environments emphasize the                 semantic aspects of computations and descriptions of computations               (programs).  A semantically founded environment provides for direct             manipulation of semantically interesting objects and structures                 without requiring a user to manipulate a syntax-based representation.           The environment is organized as a collection of interacting                     components.  Each component packages a well-defined aspect of a                 language or program with appropriate user-interfaces and editing                models.  This approach capitalizes on an environment's ability to               stimulate or hide many idiosyncrasies present in textual                        representations of programs.                                                         This program is a two year investigation of the principles and             technologies underlying semantically founded development environments.          The research is expected to bring new advances in the fields of                 environment architecture, program development paradigms, semantic               description methods, and the use of logic to support programming.",
