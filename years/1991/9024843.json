 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute of Ecosystem Studies will host an international                   conference on \"Human as Components of Ecosystems\" on 4 May                      through 7 May 1991.  The conference is designed to provide a                    forum to explore how human influences on ecosystems can be                      incorporated better into basic ecological studies.  Although                    there have been in the past periodic calls for the inclusion of                 humans and their effects in ecological studies, ecologists have                 not often responded.  However, the field is now receptive due to                the widespread acceptance of a view of nature accommodating the                 patchiness and openness of systems, and the role of allogenic and               episodic processes.  The Cary Conference seeks to stimulate the                 timely inclusion of humans as ecological factors.  The specific                 goals of the conference are to:                                                                                                                                 1    Investigate the similarities and differences between human                      and non-human influences on ecosystems.                                                                                                                    2.   Integrate information from ecology with that from a variety                     of other disciplines by bringing together ecologists, human                     ecologists, historians, geographers, economists, and                            sociologists to exchange ideas, pose research questions, and                    share data and methodologies for studying human influences                      on ecosystems.                                                                                                                                             3.   Produce an edited book containing ideas, data, research                         methodologies and conclusions from a diversity of                               disciplines relevant to the study of human influences on                        ecosystems.                                                                                                                                                As in previous Cary Conferences, the emphasis of this meeting                   will be on the exchange of knowledge, discussion and the critical               examination of the fundamental ideas in ecology.  Speakers and                  other participants will be challenged to extend their thinking                  beyond the day-to-day limits of their own research fields.  Such                an open and critical evaluation will help to stimulate the                      ecological community, and encourage the integration of ideas from               a diversity of disciplines, and will provide the foundation for                 new research directions.",
