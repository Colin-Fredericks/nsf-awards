 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coming to a differentiated view of motion seems to be                      one of the important prerequisites for coming to a Newtonian                    view of forces.  In this project we will attempt to induce                      change in student conceptions of motion and forces.  The                        microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) approach has been shown                    to accomplish this for high school and college students.  We                    intend to find out to what extent the same will be true for                     students in the fourth, sixth, and eighth grades.  These                        students will use MBL equipment in a series of collaborative                    lessons which are designed to induce cognitive                                  disequilibration and then to facilitate student efforts in                      making sense of the surprises they uncover in the laboratory                    activities.  We will be looking for evidence of change in                       their descriptions of motion and for evidence that they can                     be disequilibrated over the contradiction between their                         beliefs about causes of motion and how forces are seen to                       influence to the motion of real objects.  To the extent that                    such evidence is found in students at a particular grade                        level, a case can be made for an attempt to induce change to                    a more Newtonian view of forces at that grade level.  The                       project is significant also in that it involves action                          research.  A classroom teacher will be a co-investigator in                     the research.  The findings of the project will:                                                                                                                     1.   have strong implications for curriculum design and                              our notions about factors which determine student                               conceptual learning and                                                                                                                                    2.   provide valuable insights into the practical                                    aspects of inducing conceptual change in the                                    classroom.",
