 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to purchase two multi-user                         instruments for oligonucleotide and peptide synthesis.  An                      Automated Oligonucleotide Synthesizer would allow uninterrupted                 core DNA service by replacing an old, undependable and                          inefficient instrument.  A Multiple Peptide Synthesizer would                   allow improvements in basic research projects currently hampered                by the expense and time required for synthesis of a large number                of peptide analogs.                                                                                                                                             The major users would be NIH/NSF funded researchers in the                      Colleges of Agriculture, Arts and Sciences, Medicine, and the                   Arizona Research Laboratories (an interdisciplinary division).                  The instruments would be housed in the Macromolecular Structures                Facility established by the Division of Biotechnology.  Skilled                 personnel will operate, maintain and train other users.                                                                                                         THe specific research that would be enhanced by these instruments               includes:  the molecular biological basis for cell                              differentiation and morphology; plant gene expression and                       responses to biological stresses (salt, low water, heat); heat                  shock proteins; RNA processing, protein transport and gene                      expression in chloroplasts; yeast mRNA stability; gene                          transcription regulation and self-processing; cytokeratin                       immunology and biochemistry; expression of insect protease                      inhibitors; insect endocrinology; insect protein, lipid, and                    structure function studies; total immune system evolution;                      electron transport protein biochemistry and studies on                          peptide/protein conformational constraints, hormone receptor                    recognition and structure/function studies.",
