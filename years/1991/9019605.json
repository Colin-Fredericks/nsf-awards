This could substantially reduce the cost of time-course                         15N experiments in terms of space and labor, while greatly                      facilitating the acquisition of information to help                             assess the role of N in plant strategies which result in                        increased productivity and resistance to stressful                              environments.  The proposed method would promote research                       in this area and could be used simultaneously with 14C to                       enable study of C and N partitioning and remobilization in                      diverse environments, genotypes and species.  The                               technique would be usable in field and controlled                               environments and could prove to be a valuable screening                         tool useful with plant breeding if N partitioning and                           remobilization are found to be one of the strategies which                      provide adaptation to moisture stress either universally                        or in environments that experience a specific type of                           drought.",
