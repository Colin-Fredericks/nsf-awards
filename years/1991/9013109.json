 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to develop a working experimental                 understanding of photopolymerization processes initiated with                   visible light initiators and using visible lasers.  The principal               application of interest is three-dimensional imaging:  using a                  laser to control the formation of contour or a shape.  Thus, a                  target of the work is to understand, eventually, the formation of               shapes from crosslinked gels and to understand how                              photopolymerization rates effect the dimensions.  Another goal is               to expand studies of photochemical polymerization processes to                  systems that can be used to unique advantage in altering or                     controlling the outcome of a chain reaction, such as under harsh                conditions.                                                                                                                                                     The specific goals for this research are:                                                                                                                       1)  To optimize initiators which function at 488 nm, 514 nm, 632                nm and > 720 nm and cause controlled polymerization \"at depth\".                                                                                                 2)  To optimize dimensional control in laser initiated acrylate                 photopolymerization, and develop techniques which form contours.                                                                                                3)  To develop time-resolved photopolymerization experiments such               that the rates of photopolymerizations can be evaluated as a                    function of initiator, monomer, light source, in the dimension Z.                                                                                               4)  To optimize property control and photospeed in laser-                       initiated acrylate photopolymerization.                                                                                                                         5)  To develop techniques for the formation of composite                        materials using laser-initiated acrylate photopolymerization.                                                                                                   6)  To develop techniques for the formation of composites and                   polymers by laser-initiated polymerization under harsh                          conditions.                                                                                                                                                     7)  To develop monomer systems, other than acrylates, that can be               efficiently photopolymerized with visible lasers.",
