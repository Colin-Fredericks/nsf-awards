This conference assembles               100-200 researchers active in the study of language processing,                 including linguists, computational linguists, psychologists and                 philosophers.  The conference typically has had invited papers                  and a fairly open poster session, primarily for graduate                        students.  This year, the organizers are emphasizing increased                  participation, including a special university-sponsored fund for                about 30 graduate student fellowships, several sessions open to                 competitive submissions and invited posters from senior                         investigators.                                                                                                                                                  There will be three didactic symposia, each devoted to presenting               a current area of research which should have a large impact on                  future sentence processing research.  (1) A second wave of                      connectionist modelling offers new ways of thinking about how to                model processes; (2) recent research has coalesced around three                 different kinds of methods for studying on-line sentence                        processing, word reading time, on-line probe responses and evoked               response potentials on the skull; (3) fresh ideas about lexical                 concepts and how they are accessed at different levels may lead                 to models which better integrate the processing of conceptual and               structural information.  In each case, the symposium will have a                main presenter whose charge is to lay out the issues, theories                  and current results in a way which sentence processing                          specialists can understand.  Commentators have been chosen to                   explore specific directions and to make specific proposals about                the implications for processing research.",
