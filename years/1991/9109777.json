 "awd_abstract_narration": "The underlying assumption of many evolutionary studies is                  that evolutionary change in developmental processes occurs                      indirectly, by selection on the characters formed by those                      processes.  While variation among characters must be the result                 of variation in underlying developmental processes, it is the                   functioning of those characters that is subject to natural                      selection.  Evolutionary change in development results, but only                because these processes give rise to the selected character.  In                contrast, a little explored aspect of evolution is the                          possibility that selection acts directly on developmental                       processes themselves.                                                                Because plants grow and develop continuously throughout                    their lifetime, developmental processes are likely to be critical               components of the functioning of these organisms and subject to                 selection.  The alpine tundra presents a particularly intriguing                environment in which to explore the results of natural selection                on plant development.  The alpine is a harsh environment with a                 very short growing season.  Plants have a limited amount of time                in which to develop, grow, and reproduce.  A common pattern of                  development in many such environments is preformation.  Plants                  form all structures used during any one growing season during the               preceding growing season.  These structures remain dormant and                  unexpanded during the winter and can expand and begin functioning               rapidly in the spring.  The alpine, however, is also an                         unpredictable environment.  Patterns of snow drift and melt are                 variable from year to year, drought is common and varies with                   patterns of snow melt, and snow and freezing temperatures can                   occur at any time during the growing season.  The most common                   pattern of plant development in such spatially and temporally                   varying environments is phenotypic plasticity (the ability of an                individual to alter its phenotype and development).                                  Thus, in the alpine, plants encounter two conflicting                      selective regimes both of which are expected to act directly on                 developmental processes.  The short harsh season is expected to                 select for the predetermined pattern of preformation, while the                 unpredictability of the environment is likely to select for                     flexibility of development.  These two patterns of development                  are in direct conflict:  preformation is likely to limit any                    flexibility or developmental response to current environmental                  conditions.  What, then, is the actual pattern of development                   that has evolved in response to these conflicting demands?                           \fThe proposed research will examine the developmental properties           of preformation and plasticity of plants in the alpine                          environment.  The results will address the issue of the evolution               of developmental processes and life histories, and can also be                  used to predict vegetation response to changing climatic                        conditions.  The Colorado alpine is currently being studied as a                model system for examining the effects of global change.  Because               the alpine is such a harsh and marginal environment, small                      climatic changes are expected to have dramatic effects on species               distribution.  A more thorough understanding of the range and                   limits of developmental responses of alpine plants to                           environmental variation will provide new and important                          information for models of vegetation change or persistence.",
