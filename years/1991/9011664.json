 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new emphasis on process-based interactions and feedbacks within               the North Inlet ecosystem will be carried out.  The coupling of                 ongoing long-term sampling programs will process-based                          experiments and transect analyses across ecological gradients is                planned.  Based upon good descriptions of the long-term temporal                variability in ecosystem structure, project emphasis will shift                 toward experiments designed to explain that variation.  These                   process-oriented studies will concentrate on areas where marsh                  habitats are encroaching into the coastal forest.  Transects                    within this watershed will be sampled to monitor spatial and                    temporal variations in nutrients, the deposition of organic                     matter, plant and animal biomass, fish migrations, and water                    movements.  Select locations along a transect will provide                      insights on very long-term processes such as marsh evolution.                   These measurements will be combined with experiments on nutrient                cycling, sedimentation, decomposition, primary production,                      fertilization, trophic dynamics and recruitment in a coordinated                effort that emphasizes exchange and transformation process.                                                                                                     Ecosystem models at a variety of spatial and temporal scales will               be developed.  They will characterize and summarize the                         complexity of the major structural and functional habitats within               North Inlet, test hypotheses, structure our field experiments,                  and ultimately, be incorporated into large landscape/climate                    models.  Models will focus our attention on general systems                     dynamics and the chemical, physical and biological interactions                 which regulate system level processes.  This focus will, in turn,               place the North Inlet LTER project in a strong position to                      evaluate the impacts of disturbance events (e.g., hurricanes),                  global climate change and regional land-use change on system                    processes at various scales.                                                                                                                                    Key long-term datasets will be extended into a second decade.                   This continuity with the past provides the measurements of long-                term variations in the estuarine structure, the indices by which                change is observed.  Statistical analyses of the short-term                     variability in these long-term data sets have shown that certain                environmentally controlled parameters, such as chlorophyll                      concentrations or seasonal fish migrations, are reasonably                      predictable, while other more biological controlled parameters,                 such as the zooplankton abundance or recruitment success of                     benthos, were unpredictable and likely to vary greatly within and               between seasons.",
