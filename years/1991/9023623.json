 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to study the tropical convective systems and                  their impact on the forcing of tropospheric and mesospheric                     circulation patterns by utilizing satellite data bases in                       conjunction with data obtained from wind profiles.  She will                    also examine the relationships between satellite derived                        measurements of atmospheric water vapor and vertical wind                       profiles measured by the radars in the tropics in order to                      provide insight into the dynamics of vertical energy fluxes which               couple the energy from the source regions to other heights.  She                also plans to obtain the statistics of cloud composites                         associated with convection in order to force a model of an                      atmosphere on a rotating sphere to establish the mode structures                in the wind field that will be present in the troposphere,                      stratosphere, and mesosphere.  The model-generated mode                         structures will be compared with the radar observed mesospheric                 structures of the diurnal tide, quasi two-day wave, and other                   longer period wave motions.  Additionally, the PI plans to gain                 expertise in two other atmospheric radar probing techniques, the                MF/HF radar and the 1 GHz boundary layer radar.",
