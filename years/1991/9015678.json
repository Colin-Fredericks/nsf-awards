 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transfer of material from one star to another in close                      \"interacting binary\" star systems appears to proceed at a highly                uneven pace.  The evolution of these systems depends sensitively                on the average mass transfer rate. Therefore a clarification of the             nature of these modulations is important to an understanding of                 both the origin and fate of these systems.  The Principal                       Investigator (PI) has received NSF support in the past to modernize             and automate the 16-inch telescope at Indiana University to conduct             measures of star brightnesses (photometry) more accurately and                  efficiently than in the past.  The PI now plans to use this                     equipment as well as a 40-inch telescope at U.S. Naval Observatory              in Flagstaff, Arizona to conduct coordinated observations every                 available clear night for three years of a sample of stars from                 three classes of interacting binaries: cataclysmic binaries, dwarf              novae, and \"Algol\" binaries.  The processes to be studied occur                 over timescales of days to years.  The research includes tests of               the \"hibernation theory\" of nova evolution, the determination of                the relationship of the \"supermaxima\" to other features in the                  light curves of dwarf novae, and the search for activity cycles in              Algol systems.",
