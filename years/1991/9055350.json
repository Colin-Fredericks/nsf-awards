 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year project is sponsored by the University of                       Washington and will provide an intensive four week summer program               for well prepared teachers of chemistry.  Thirty teachers will be               selected each year on a competitive basis from the Northwest,                   including Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming.               The focus of the program will be environmental chemistry.  The                  course will entail learning of content, development of teaching                 demonstrations, working with modern instrumentation and computers               and microscale experiments.  The teachers will also participate                 in a contemporary issues seminar.  Teachers will be taking topics               relating to inservice activities and will be expected to assume                 teacher leadership responsibilities after the program is over.                                                                                                  The amount of cost share in this proposal is equivalent to 36% of               the NSF funds.",
