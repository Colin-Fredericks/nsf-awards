 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Dr. David Browman, Mr. Cristobal Gnecco, a                graduate student at Washington University will collect data for                 his doctoral dissertation.  In 1985, an extensive archaeological                site was discovered in the course of road and sewer construction                in the Popayan Valley in southwestern Colombia.  Preliminary                    analysis indicates that the stone tools are attributable to                     paleoindian hunters and gatherers and may date to approximately                 11,000 years ago.  With NSF support, Mr. Gnecco will return to                  the La Elvira site and conduct careful stratigraphic excavation.                He will strip a large horizontal expanse both to recover                        additional cultural materials and to set the site into a clearer                geological context.  Distributional data thus collected will                    hopefully shed light on the spatial organization of activities.                 Both organic and obsidian materials will be dated by radiocarbon                and hydration techniques respectively.  Finally, Mr. Gnecco and                 his collaborators will attempt a paleoclimatic reconstruction of                the site.  A core will be obtained and pollen and plant                         macrofossils analyzed.  Regional vegetation will be collected to                provide a comparative base.                                                                                                                                     Although archaeologists agree that the first people to enter the                New World crossed from Asia via the Bering Land bridge into                     Alaska, it has been surprising to learn that some of the earliest               known archaeological sites are located in South America.  Just                  how and when the first peoples entered this part of the world is                unknown.  It is also surprising that while in North America these               \"paleoindian\" peoples are associated with big game hunting in                   relatively open environments, in South America such appears not                 to be the case.  The question of paleoindian prehistory in South                America is complicated by the relative dearth of archaeological                 data.  In this context, information recovered from the La Elvira                site is extremely important.  It is also interesting that this                  rich archaeological occurrence is located in a forested valley.                                                                                                 This research is important for several reasons.  It will help to                fill a glaring archaeological gap and the data will be of great                 interest to a large number of prehistorians.  The research should               shed new light on the adaptations of early New World peoples and                will help in the training of an extremely promising young                       scientist.",
