 "awd_abstract_narration": "The profound change in conceptions of space, \"from the closed world             to the infinite universe,\" has been matched by a parallel change                in conceptions of time, from a universe a few thousand years old                to one estimated in billions.  Those two historical developments                have been of equal cultural importance, but the latter is far less              understood.  This change in human understanding of time of our                  world should not be considered primarily as a mere expansion of the             timescale, but rather in terms of a reconstruction of the history               of nature.  The crucial period in the reconstruction of earth                   history was the early 19th century, during which a plethora of                  competing conjectures was replaced by a broadly consensual view                 that is still embedded in the modern earth sciences.  The most                  decisive part of this research  was the reconstruction of                       geologically recent earth history (in modern terms, Cenozoic).                  This penetrated what was perceived as an epistemic barrier between              human and prehuman history, and clarified the enigmatic event                   (first conceived as a Deluge, later as an Ice Age) that marked that             boundary.  It is this later period that Professor Rudwick is                    examining in this fundamentally important study.",
