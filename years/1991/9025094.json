The objectives of this proposal are the investigation of                        solids entrainment to the jet area in a fluidized bed, and the                  development of a multiphase model to explain and scale-up the                   results.  The experiments is simple, but important for                          understanding a phenomenon commonly encountered in fluidized                    bed systems.  Modeling is performed with simplifying                            assumption by retaining in the equations only the most                          significant effects.  Matching funds for personnel and                          materials will be provided by the Energy Center at IIT.                                                                                                         The proposed analysis of a fluidized bed with a central jet                     has relevance for numerous applications.  The fluidized beds                    with no jet is a limiting case of the present device.  It is                    expected that the proposed approach will provide a                              quantitative basis for better understanding and designing the                   fluidized bed systems.",
