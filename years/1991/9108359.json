This                  research addresses the problems of modeling at the appropriate                  level of detail for the purpose of controlling physical or                      biological systems under time or computation resources                          constraints.  The research is to develop, implement and test a                  method of dynamic selection of models for use in real-time                      applications.  The PI's first develop and organize multiple                     simplifications of a detailed (base) model of the domain by                     applying combinations of domain-specific simplifying assumptions.               They create an explicit representation of these assumptions and                 develop methods to reason dynamically with the assumptions to                   find the simplest model with valid assumptions.  The PI's test                  the hypothesis that the simplest model with valid assumptions is                optimal according to a decision-theoretic definition of                         optimality.  The system is implemented in the domain of human                   cardiopulmonary physiology, with the control task of finding                    settings for a ventilator (mechanical breathing device).  The                   research will provide improved methods of applying complex models               in time-critical applications, enable the use of previously                     intractable models in real-time applications, and merge numeric                 simulation and control methodologies with formal decision theory.                //",
