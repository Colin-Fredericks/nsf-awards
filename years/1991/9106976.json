 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Slodkowski will investigate the structure of                     envelopes of holomorphy where he is especially interested in                    problems related to their construction and univalence.  Some                    questions of existence of analytic discs and varieties in envelopes             of holomorphy and of the uniqueness of Levi-flat hypersurfaces will             also be addressed.  Finding answers to these questions should be                very helpful in solving a second set of problems involving the                  extendibility of holomorphic motions and related questions                      concerning the holomorphic axiom of choice.                                          The areas under investigation here involve the theory of                   functions of several complex variables.  The structure imposed by               requiring that a function of several complex variables be                       differentiable (as in elementary calculus) is a very rich one.  In              particular, given a set in which such a function is defined, it is              important to know the largest set to which all such functions can               be extended maintaining their differentiability.  This \"envelope of             holomorphy\" is not well understood and one of Professor                         Slodkowski's projects is to develop methods to find it.",
