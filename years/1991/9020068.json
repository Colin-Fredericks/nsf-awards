 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for final assembly of a proof-of-                concept demonstrator unmanned research aircraft and preparation                 for initial flight testing.  The award is the fourth program                    element in a five program element in a five program element                     project to design, build, test and fly an unmanned research                     aircraft.  The previously completed program elements (the design                and construction of the aircraft components) were funded by                     Aurora Flight Science, NASA and NSF.  NASA anticipates it will                  fund the fifth element (flight testing) of the program.                              The promise of significant capability enhancements                         associated with an unmanned, high altitude, long duration, low                  Reynolds number, lightweight aircraft has been enthusiastically                 received within the scientific community.  A variety of missions                for such an aircraft have been proposed.  An incomplete list                    includes:  stratospheric ozone chemistry research;  exploring the               impact of SST emissions on the stratosphere;  measuring the                     earth's radiation budget;  determining sources and sinks of CO2                 and CH4;  studying stratosphere-troposphere exchange; and                       hurricane research.  Some of these missions require extremely                   high altitude capability (up to 30km), while others require                     platforms with less altitude capability but longer durations than               required for the stratospheric ozone mission.  A single aircraft                designs is not planned to accomplish all the missions mentioned                 above.  However, aircraft designs necessary to carry out these                  missions will be derived from a common technology base that is to               be funded, in part, under this project.  At the center of the                   design strategy is a basic aircraft, manned Perseus, that will                  serve as a proof-of-concept for the scientific unmanned aircraft.                    This is a high risk project with a tremendous potential for                significantly expanding the time and space domain of in situ                    atmospheric observations that could be collected in the                         future.***//",
