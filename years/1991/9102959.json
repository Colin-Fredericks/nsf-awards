 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the symmetry groups of shift dynamical               systems and smooth manifolds.  Ideas from algebraic K-theory are                applicable to each area and form a common theme between them.                   The investigator will continue to study the algebraic and                       homological properties of symmetries of one-dimensional sub-                    shifts of finite type (SFT's), sofic, and other shift dynamical                 systems.  These systems arise in a number of contexts, including                dynamics, information theory, and statistical mechanics.  Their                 symmetries are often called invertible or reversible cellular                   automata.  He will also study similar questions for higher                      dimensional Markov shifts and their symmetries.                                      The classic Alexander polynomial of a knot in three-                       dimensional space is closely linked to the algebraic K-theory                   group K1.  Recently, other polynomial invariants have been found                for these knots, starting with the work of Vaughan Jones.                       Pseudo-isotopies and diffeomorphisms of manifolds in a wide range               of cases (including knot complements) have invariants involving                 the algebraic K-theory group K2.  The investigator will examine                 whether it is possible to define new invariants of                              diffeomorphisms of knot complements and other 3-manifolds in                    analogy with the new knot polynomials.                                               The commonality of method here is surprising.  A deep and                  highly evolved algebraic theory, K-theory, is to be brought to                  bear upon symmetry questions which are very far apart in                        appearance.  On the one hand are subtle topological questions                   about knots.  On the other hand are subtle combinatorial and                    statistical questions about infinite strings of symbols.  The                   latter application has already borne substantial fruit.",
