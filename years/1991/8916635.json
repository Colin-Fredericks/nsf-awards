 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ice core drilling has provided some of the most important                  paleoclimatic information for the Quaternary interval of earth                  history.  With ice core samples it has been possible to                         determine the relationship between climate change and atmospheric               gas composition.  In some low latitude regions the accumulation                 rate of snow is high enough to resolve annual variations in                     climate and ENSO scale events.  This proposal requests support to               drill such an ice cap, the Guliya ice cap in China.  Located on                 the northwestern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, it is the                 largest and highest subtropical ice cap in the world.  Thus it is               likely to contain the best, uninterrupted record of paleoclimate                and atmospheric chemistry from the low latitudes.  Using the ice                core samples, along with others they collected from low latitude                sites in China and Peru, the PIs will oversee a comprehensive                   analysis of past climate, and atmospheric gas and dust                          composition.  This research is important because it will provide                the first low latitude record of atmospheric gas composition and                its relationship to climate change.  It will also provide us                    with the best record of the relationship of low latitude, high                  elevations climate to the record of monsoon variability in                      southern Asia and thus provide information on the relationship                  between ENSO events and monsoon activity.",
