 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Treatise of Invertebrate Paleontology comprises 35                     volumes published over a 40 year interval.  These volumes are                   compendia of the genera of fossil invertebrates, and they have                  had an immeasurable impact on research and graduate training in                 paleontology.  In addition to catalyzing further systematic,                    paleoecological, and evolutionary research, the Treatise has made               summary data available for statistical analysis, thereby creating               an entirely new approach to paleobiology.  Dr. Roger Kaesler,                   Editor in Chief of the Treatise, proposes two years of planning                 activities that will lead to implementation of a computer                       database to accompany future printed Treatise volumes.                               The proposed initiation of computerization for the Treatise                will have an enormous impact on research in paleontology.  The                  proposed database will establish the means to connect Treatise                  data directly to other taxonomic databases, to computerized                     catalogs of museum specimens, to literature databases, and to                   Geographic Information Systems.  The proposed planning activities               are forward-looking and will establish long-range directions that               will benefit large segments of the biological and geological                    research communities.",
