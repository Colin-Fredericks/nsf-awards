 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory is held               approximately every eighteen months at sites alternating between                the United States and foreign countries.  The 1991 symposium will               be held June 24 through June 28 in Budapest, Hungry.                                                                                                            The areas covered in this symposium will include detection and                  estimation theory, coding and modulation, neural nets and                       communications, source coding, data compression, storage channels,              multi-user comminications, cryptography, data networks, pattern                 recognition, optical communications, and information theory.                                                                                                    The proposal requests support partial travel support for US                     scientists whose papers have beem selected but who sould without                support be unable to attend.  Many of these will be advanced                    graduate students.  About 30 awards are anticipated.  The awardees              will be chosen by a committee headed by the PI.                                                                                                                 This is one of two such meetings for which the NCR program has a                history of providing partical travel support.  The other is the                 IEEE Communications Theory Workshop.",
