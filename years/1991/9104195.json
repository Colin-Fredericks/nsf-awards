 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will continue his               study of questions related to weighted norm inequalities for                    integral and differential operators.  Specifically he will focus                upon weighted norm inequalities for Poisson integrals, fractional               integrals, Hilbert transforms, and elliptic and parabolic                       operators.  This theoretical work is applicable to (and motivated               by) the following problems:  the derivation of sharp estimates                  for the fundamental solutions of degenerate parabolic equations,                the estimation of the distribution of eigenvalues of various                    operators, and the elucidation of the continuity properties of                  solutions of integral and differential equations.                                    Much of what mathematicians call \"analysis\" involves                       deriving and applying \"a'priori\" estimates on the solutions of                  integral and differential equations.  An a'priori estimate                      esentially provides a mathematician with information about a                    solution that is contained in the equation itself, and its                      derivation does not require a detailed knowledge of the putative                solution. As an illustration,  solutions of certain types of                    boundary value problems for elliptic equations satisfy an                       a'priori estimate of the following type; namely, the solution is                bounded from above (below) by the largest (smallest) value of the               boundary values.  In this project the principal investigator will               use what are called \"norm inequalities\" to derive sharp a'priori                estimates on the solutions of various integral and differential                 equations.",
