 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop and apply both                     intrinsic and extrinsic fluorophoric sensors embedded in polymers               and composites for monitoring such processes as cure, water uptake,             and oxidation via fiber-optic fluorimeter or phosphorimeter.  These             sensors are molecularly designed to respond to the chemical changes             occurring in polymers/composites rather than to the viscosity                   changes, thus making them potentially more sensitive and                        quantitatively correlatable to the chemical processes.  Sensor                  molecules are designed to generate fluorescence response at                     different spectral regions so that each process can be monitored                independently, as much as possible.  Cure sensors are aromatic                  diamines either mimicking the cure agent (extrinsic) or the cure                agent itself (intrinsic).  Uv absorption, excitation and                        phosphorescence spectra of these cure sensors will be studied in                epoxy and polyimide in order to correlate with the extent of cure,              and to obtain information on the kinetics and the mechanisms,                   particularly during chemical imidization.  Water uptake will be                 investigated using as extrinsic sensor, 9-anthroic acid while                   oxidation will be studied via intrinsic fluorescence.  These                    sensors will be implemented by fiber-optic instrumentation to carry             out in-situ monitoring of neat epoxy and polyimide, followed by                 composites.  In composites, surface, bulk, and fiber interphase                 will be probed for cure extent, cure kinetics, moisture uptake, and             oxidation by placement of fiber probe at selective locations.                                                                                                   The significance of this project is two-fold; the application of                uv-vis/fluorescence as a powerful characterization tool for                     chemical processes, and the development of \"smart\" materials with               built-in sensors for in-situ optimization of fabrication process as             well as monitoring long-term stability of chemical/structural                   changes.",
