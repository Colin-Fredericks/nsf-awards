The wavelength of the                                                 rare-earth related 4f emissions                                                 practically does not depend on the                                              bandgap energy of the host crystal                                              and is immune to temperature                                                    variations.  However, the gain of                                               the lasers is not high and the rare-                                            earth doping and excitation process                                             is not clearly understood.  We                                                  propose a systematic investigation                                              of GaAs and InP-based semiconductors                                            - mainly GaAs and InGaAsP - doped                                               during MBE by Er and by implantation                                            of Yb.  The experiments will include                                            time-resolved luminescence with both                                            resonant and non-resonant                                                       excitation, conductance and                                                     admittance spectroscopy to                                                      characterize deep levels, low and                                               high field transport and reflectance                                            measurements.  It is expected that                                              these experiments will improve the                                              basic understanding of the doping                                               process, changes in the material                                                radiative and non-radiative                                                     properties, and the temporal                                                    characteristics of the rare-earth                                               related transitions.  The latter are                                            particularly important for the                                                  design of high-speed pulsed lasers.                                             The PI also proposes the use of                                                 rare-earth doped materials in a                                                 couple of novel laser structures.                                               In the first the active medium is a                                             selectively doped MQW with narrow                                               rare-earth doped wells.  In the                                                 second, a cascade of avalanching                                                carriers is made to resonate with                                               the rare-earth transition energy,                                               thereby causing a large non-                                                    equilibrium distribution through                                                collision excitation.",
