 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Cittadino is continuing his study of the development of the                 science of ecology between World Wars I and II.  His project                    entails a thorough investigation into the history of ecological                 science during the 1920s and 1930s from an international                        perspective and with an effort to interrelate intellectual,                     cultural, social, and institutional themes.  The investigation                  includes examination of primary and secondary sources and travel                to a number of important archives.  The period between the wars                 witnessed the intellectual and institutional maturation of ecology,             the emergence of methodologies and concepts usually associated with             the postwar period, the emergence of methodologies and concepts                 usually associated with the postwar period, the emergence of                    identifiable schools, and the initial encounters between this new               science and a variety of social and ideological views and                       practices.  This study promises a substantial contribution to the               historical understanding of ecological science, still more or less              in its infancy, and offers a unique perspective of a multi-                     dimensional study carried out from an international point of view.",
