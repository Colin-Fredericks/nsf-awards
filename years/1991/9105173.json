 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Yu will work in two areas of graph theory.  He                   will study contractible edges and their applications, as well as                cycles, cycle covers, and cycle decompositions.                                      Graph Theory began more than two hundred years ago with the                work of L. Euler, but it is only in the last half-century that                  the field has flourished.  It is now one of the most active,                    fertile branches of mathematics.  A graph is a network of lines                 (\"edges\") joining points (\"vertices\"), so that graph theory                     becomes a natural tool for studying interrelationships among                    separated entities.  Graph Theory is used not only in                           Communications Theory but in surprisingly many parts of pure and                applied mathematics, as well as in Theoretical Computer Science.",
