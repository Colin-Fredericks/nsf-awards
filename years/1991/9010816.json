 "awd_abstract_narration": "Throughout history, the legitimacy of the state has been generally              thought to be tied to territoriality and familiar concepts of                   voting and voice.  Law has been considered to play a supportive                 role in the political and economic systems in the state.  This                  project promises a radical revision of the concept of society                   organizing politics around territoriality and \"voice\" and suggests              conceptualizing a society organized around movement or \"exit,\" with             the legal system playing a major role.                                                                                                                          To demonstrate this new concept, the investigator will conduct a                comparative history of state-building in medieval Europe and the                Islamic world.  The study will trace the role of law in the                     medieval Islamic world order as the crucial institution that                    allowed free movement of goods, people, and capital.  It is argued              that the coherence of the medieval world order was structured by                movement or exit.  Critical to the working of exit as a device for              ordering transnational markets is the role of law as a system of                establishing property rights and resolving disputes.  Primary                   Arabic source material and secondary social history documents will              be examined to test the thesis that merchants, artisans, and                    intellectuals moved freely in the Middle East during the medieval               Islamic world and that movement was related to the tax policies of              the local kings.  Thus, instead of belonging to a particular polity             or powerful state, they participated in the structuring of a                    translocal market in the southern Mediterranean region.  This                   created a system of economic and political relations which                      minimized the costs of movement (exit) and enhanced competition                 between would-be monarchs, thus limiting the attempts of potential              aggrandizers to create territorial dynasties.  In Europe, by                    contrast, the legitimacy of the state was tied to territoriality,               voting, and voice.                                                                                                                                              This study offers a new perspective for understanding medieval                  history and for shedding light on why the political structure of                Islam was so different from the political structure of Europe.  In              addition, the open and fluid character of the market in medieval                Islam also bears certain structural resemblances to the                         transnational character of global markets in the present world                  order.  Thus, this project should advance our comparative                       understanding of the way in which markets are formed and                        structured.  The possibilities for exiting a political system (made             possible by the presence of Islamic law across the domains of Islam             and the weakness of individual Islamic states) helps to understand              the world of increasing interdependence.  The part that Islamic law             played in the process has important implications for the sociolegal             aspects of contemporary global change.",
