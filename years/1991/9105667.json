 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support research in mathematics and material               science. In particular, Professor Taylor will investigate the                   shapes of surfaces which minimize surface energy subject to                     various constraints. The evolution of these surfaces is                         determined by the current shape and position of the surface and                 involves factors such as mobility and surface energy reduction.                 Surface energies which are so anisotropic that single crystals in               equilibrium are polyhedra are of particular interest.                                Professor Taylor will continue to study both the                           mathematical and physical theory of crystal growth. She will also               continue to develop computer algorithms which will illustrate the               mathematical ideas and serve as an experimental tool. The use of                computer experiments as an aid in the development of theory is                  one of the many unique aspects to the research.",
