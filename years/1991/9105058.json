 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discharge of nematocysts on sea anemone tentacles is                     regulated by vibration-sensitive mechanoreceptors (VSMs).  These                VSMs have the useful attribute of being tuned to lower frequencies              by chemoreceptors for N-acetylated sugars, and to higher                        frequencies by chemoreceptors for amino compounds.  Thus, frequency             responsiveness can be modulated upward or downward depending on the             presence of different chemical agonists.  Furthermore, the                      morphology of the VSMs is significantly affected by the agonists.               Exposure to N-acetylated sugars induces the VSMs to elongate,                   whereas exposure to amino compounds induces the VSMs to widen at                the base.  Hence, agonist effects on VSM structure can be analyzed              in relation to agonist effects on VSM function.  In this project,               parallel studies will be conducted in which VSMs are measured, and              nematocyst discharge is tested after exposing sea anemeones to                  specific chemical agonists.  The resulting data will be used to                 develop models predicting frequency and amplitude responsiveness                according to the morphology of the VSMs.  In addition, the effects              of agonists on the ultrastructure of stereocilia comprising the                 VSMs will be determined.  The proposed research will examine the                relationship between structure and function for dynamic VSMs, and               open the door for investigations on the molecular basis for VSM                 tuning.                                                                                                                                                         This project addresses a topic of fundamental importance to the                 survival of primitive animals, in that the research has direct                  implications for understanding how sea anemones select and capture              prey.  The VSMs on the tentacles of sea anemones are similar in                 morphology to the VSMs of the acousticolateralis system of                      vertebrates, in that in each case the VSMs comprise a bundle of                 stereocilia.  Because the sea anemone VSMs are induced by                       chemoreceptors to alter their shape and responsiveness to                       vibrations, they are ideally suited for evaluating structure in                 relation to function.  Furthermore, the project has relevance to                the broader topic of biosensors.",
