 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first National Symposium on Frontiers of Science meeting was held in        March 1989 at the Beckman Center in Irvine, California.  A second               meeting was held November 1-3, 1990.  The meetings are designed to bring        together a selected group of young U. S. scientists to discuss exciting         advances and opportunities in their respective fields in a format that          encourages, and allows adequate time for, informal one-on-one                   discussions among participants.  Interaction of the future leaders of U.        S. science is intended, inter alia, to stimulate future collaboration in        research and the transfer of new techniques and approaches across               fields.  Speakers focus their talks on current cutting-edge research in         their field to a scientifically sophisticated but non-specialist                audience and provide a sense of the experimental data--what is actually         measured and seen in the various fields.  They provide information such         as:  What are the major research problems and unique tools in the field?        What are the current limitations on advances as well as the frontiers?                                                                                          Topics for the November 7-9, 1991 meeting include:  aging, AIDS and AIDS        transmission, biological structure, immunology, materials chemistry,            protein structure and folding, evolutionary biology, particle physics,          nuclear physics, the Sun, dark matter, cosmic wave background, planetary        science, mass extinctions, oceanography, global change, earthquake              science and prediction, artificial intelligence, combinatorial                  algorithms, computational geometry, micromachining, laser atom trapping,        scanning tunneling microscopy, and accelerator mass spectrometry.",
