 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA replication in Escherichia coli is catalyzed by DNA polymerase              III holoenzyme.  This enzyme, thought to coordinate leading and                 lagging strand synthesis as an asymmetric dimer, contains                       polymerizing activity in a core plus essential auxiliary factors.               Two of the auxiliary factors, tau and gamma, are the products of                one gene, dnaX.  They are synthesized in equimolar amounts and,                 although their exact functions are unknown, it is possible that                 their asymmetry.  Tau is the translation product of the full-length             dnaX reading frame; the shorter gamma shares the same N-terminal                sequence as tau but is terminated within the tau reading frame by               a programmed ribosomal frameshift followed by a nonsense condon in              the new frame.  Knowledge of the sequence and mechanism of gamma                formation makes possible investigations of tau and gamma functions.             Specifically, the requirement for each tau and gamma in vivo                    (because the in vitro data are equivocal) will be tested by                     generation of mutant dnaX alleles which synthesize only tau or only             gamma and gene replacement.  Other mutant genes and proteins                    altered in ATPase and suspected helicase motifs will be analyzed                in vivo and in vitro to correlate loss of complementing activity,               ATPase, helicase, and ability to support polymerization in vitro.               Second, dnaX gene expression will be preliminarily characterized.               Third, the sequenced of dnaA mutations which suppress dnaX(Ts)                  mutants will be determined.",
