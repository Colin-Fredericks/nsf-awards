 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, the field of algebraic topology has become                increasingly applied to problems in geometry and physics.                       Homotopy-theoretic techniques have yielded new insight into                     problems derived from gauge theory; there has been important                    progress in applying topological techniques to problems in modular              representation theory; and geometric information can now be                     extracted from group cohomology, which serves as a fertile common               ground for an exchange of ideas from representation theory, group               actions and stable homotopy.                                                         This grant will support a conference in algebraic topology at              the University of Wisconsin in the fall of 1991.  The invited                   speakers are the top researchers in the field and the conference is             likely to result in fundamental advances, both in topology and in               the applications of topology, and in fruitful interactions between              the disparate fields of mathematics and mathematical physics.",
