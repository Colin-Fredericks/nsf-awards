 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to increase the current knowledge             base in the field of numerically controlled (NC) machining of                   sculptured surfaces.  This research applies geometric simulation                methods to three and five axis sculptured surface tool path                     generation.  Specifically, the following questions are being                    explored: (1) What are the best algorithms for subdivision of                   sculptured surfaces into a polygonal representation to be used for              NC tool path generation? (2) What is the time/accuracy trade-off                in using points versus polygons as a surface representation for NC              tool path generation? (3) Can the non-isoparametric tool path                   planning algorithm developed for three axis machining be extended               to the five axis case? (4) Can efficient and accurate geometric                 models of the volume swept by a five axis tool movement be defined?             (5) Can parallel algorithms be applied to the NC tool path planning             problem?                                                                             This project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between the             Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of New                      Hampshire, the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at                Dartmouth College, and an industrial sponsor.  It has the potential             of greatly improving sculptured surface machining.  In practice,                it should enhance the production of metal forming dies.",
