 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Computing for Science Education project proposes to                utilize and build upon state of the art computing technology to                 construct a general purpose science learning environment.  The                  environment will provide a powerful and unique integration of                   computing tools that is specifically targeted to the needs of                   students in a scientific discipline.  It seeks to develop a                     general language and learning environment that supports student                 efforts to pose and answer broad classes of  questions of                       scientific interest and to test them in a simulated environment.                The proposed work is innovative in that it promotes a style of                  learning and scientific inquiry that is not available in current                computer-based learning environments for science.  This is                      accomplished by utilizing a programming language as a vehicle for               scientific discourse, exploiting abstraction as a means of                      dealing with complexity, and incorporating high quality graphics                and animation capabilities.  It is intended to supplement a                     complete science curriculum with a virtual laboratory that allows               experimentation which may otherwise be impossible or require                    prohibitive resources.  In contrast to traditional systems,                     student participation is not limited to avenues that have been                  anticipated in advance by the author of the lesson.                                                                                                             The proposed work is important because it addresses widely                      perceived problems of science education by motivating and                       encouraging students to apply their knowledge and develop their                 skills of scientific inquiry in exploring important and                         interesting topics of advanced science.  This work postulates                   that a computer programming language is useful and powerful as a                language of scientific discourse.  This assertion will be tested                by evaluating the effectiveness of the environment in situations                of varying teacher-student computing backgrounds in an advanced                 course in developmental biology, freshman college course, and in                a high school biology course. //",
