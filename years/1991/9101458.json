 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Ruh will investigate some problems in Riemannian                 geometry by using techniques of deformation theory. In particular,              he will study deformation of metrics, connections, and curvature.               The general goal is to obtain optimal structures on manifolds in                order to draw conclusions about the geometry of the manifold.                   Professor Ruh will consider the deformation of almost Lie groups                into Lie groups and the deformation of general Riemannian metrics               into metrics with prescribed curvature conditions. The foundation               of deformation theory lies in partial differential equations and                the heat equation in particular.                                                     One underlying theme which has turned out to be extremely                  useful in mathematics is that of deformation to a desired                       structure. In order to obtain an optimal structure it is often                  useful to construct a structure which has some of the desired                   properties but not all of them. One then seeks to \"deform\" the                  initial structure to one with the desired properties. The mechanism             used to make the deformation should preserve at least those aspects             of the desired structure which one was able to attain as a first                step.",
