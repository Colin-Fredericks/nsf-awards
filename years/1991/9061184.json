 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deep UV and I-line lithography will be used extensively throughout the          1990's to build submicron integrated circuits.  Recent studies with             commercial deep UV and I-line photoresists have shown that their                performance falls dramatically when printing over reflective                    substrates such as polysilicon and aluminum.  The formation of                  standing waves and stray reflections causes a severe loss of                    resolution and CD control.                                                                                                                                      The simplest approach for controlling reflectivity is to apply a light          absorbing polymer film, or antireflective coating (ARC), beneath the            resist.  ARCs have been used successfully for the past decade by chip           makers working at G-line.  The high absorptivity of the antireflective          coating is obtained by the addition of dyes to the polymer coating.                                                                                             To be compatible with submicron processing, antireflective coatings             for I-line and deep UV lithography must be extremely thin ( 0.1um) and          plasma etchable.  Obtaining adequate absorptivity with such thin films          is difficult using a conventional dye-filled polymer coating.  The              solution to this problem is to develop polymer coatings which are               intrinsically absorbing at the exposure wavelength.  This innovation            eliminates the need for dyes and allows the optical density of the ARC          to be increased.                                                                                                                                                During Phase I we will investigate the preparation of novel                     intrinsically absorbing polymers for I-line and deep UV ARC                     applications.  The polymer structures will be developed using results           from physical property determination and real life lithographic                 testing.",
