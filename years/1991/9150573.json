 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colgate is engaged in a major revision of its introductory                      calculus-based physics curriculum.  This is being done to                       address three concerns:  declining enrollments, inadequate                      preparation of incoming students, and low minority                              representation.  The first semester of the new curriculum,                      called Modern Introductory Physics, has been developed and                      taught over the past five years.  Organized about the theme of                  atoms, it presents to freshmen the central ideas of twentieth                   century physics.  This is a strong motivator, and the course                    has been well received by students.  This project is directed                   at development of the second semester curriculum.  The theme                    chosen, unification, builds naturally on the first semester                     material, easily encompasses the traditional topics of the                      introductory course, and presents physics as the great unifying                 science.  The three sections of the course are Newtonian                        Mechanics, Conservation Laws, and Statistical Physics.  The                     course concludes by discussing the origin of the elements,                      bringing students full circle to the beginning of the first                     semester study of atoms.  Faculty expect to generate 300 pages                  of supplementary written materials plus eight novel laboratory                  exercises blending classical and modern physics.  An outside                    consultant will be employed to teach staff the methods of                       course evaluation, and the results will be reported in the                      published literature.",
