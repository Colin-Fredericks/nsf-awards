 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamics of age-structured epidemic and population                     problems lead to systems of nonlinear hyperbolic equations that                 can be studied by the use of semigroup theory.  Explicit                        threshold criteria, the asymptotic behavior of the solutions, and               the general forms of the nonlinear force of infection terms have                been obtained in certain cases, and these results will be used as               the basis for a systematic development of methods for estimating                the pertinent model parameters using available data on specific                 diseases.  A second area of biomathematical research that will be               pursued involves the study of the triggering of DNA synthesis in                eucaryotic cells through the use of compartmental                               reaction-diffusion models.  These models lead to                                coupled semi-linear parabolic equations with time delays that are               due to transcription and translation delays and the movement of                 biochemicals in the cell.  The main methods of analysis here                    involve the development and use of local and global bifurcation                 results for such reaction-diffusion equations.                                  Parameter identification and estimation on the basis of available               data will be addressed in these models also.                                         This research is concerned with two mathematical problems                  with biological applications.  The first part of this research                  will develop and  study mathematical models that help predict the               course of infections and which form the basis for making                        decisions on how to best use available resources in order to                    control the spread of diseases.  The age structure of the                       affected population is very important in determining the course                 and effects of most diseases.  Models will be developed and                     studied that account for the age distribution of the population                 and that lead to methods for predicting the course of the disease               and the effects of proposed control strategies.  The results will               be applied to the study of optimal control strategies for                       specific diseases.   The second part of this research will seek                 to shed light on the mechanism that triggers animal cells to                    start replicating their genetic material and reproducing.  This                 is a fundamental question that has implications in the                          understanding of growth and development of embryos as well as in                disorders such as cancer that result from abnormal cell                         proliferation.  The mathematical models to be studied are                       designed to allow a detailed analysis of this crucial DNA                       synthesis triggering mechanism.",
