 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new and novel technique will be developed for the                             determination of amorphous silica in marine sediments.  It is                   based on the high temperature titration of amorphous silica                     with added calcium carbonate according to the reaction:  SiO2 +                 CaCO3 ----- CaSiiO3 + CO2.  The proposed research will proceed                  along three lines:  1. Further development of the method.                       Preliminary pyrolysis experiments were done at 500oC for three                  days.  Subsequent work was at 700oC for one hour.  These new                    conditions necessitate the repetition of many experiments to                    determine the optimum temperature and time and the dependence                   of the reaction on mineralogy, water content etc. for the                       optimum conditions.  2. Revaluation of the marine silica                        budget.  Preliminary work indicates that calcareous oozes and                   continental shelf sediments are much more important sinks than                  previously believed.  3. The use of the &18O of the product CO2                 as a measure of the &18O of amorphous silica and the paleocean                  from which it was deposited.  //",
