 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Gutman is supported by a grant from the                            Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the kinetics                   and thermochemistry of elementary reactions involving                           polyatomic radicals of the second row elements and halogens or                  hydrogen halides.  Experimental techniques include the use of                   excimer laser photolysis to produce the free radicals under                     controlled conditions and time-resolved experiments to monitor                  reactants and products.  The radicals to be studied include                     halo- and perhalomethyls, oxygen containing radicals, nitrogen                  centered radicals and unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals. Studies                 of reactions of  free radicals of the heavier elements,                         particularly radicals of silicon, phosphorus, germanium, and                    arsenic are of particular interest because it is likely that                    new chemical routes are open to radicals of these elements due                  to their ability to be in higher valence states than carbon.                    %%%                                                                             The objectives of this research are to gain new fundamental                     knowledge of the kinetics and dynamics of elementary reactions                  of polyatomic free radicals and to determine important                          thermochemical properties of these species.  The radicals to be                 studied in this project are important to atmospheric chemistry                  and combustion; the halogenated radicals are relevant to our                    search for replacements for the ozone-destroying                                chlorofluorocarbons.  An exciting part of the research is the                   study of the chemistry of radicals of phosphorus, silicon,                      arsenic, and germanium which are likely to be involved in                       chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactors. Chemical vapor                        deposition is one of the primary techniques used for growing                    thin films and coatings used in the semiconductor industry for                  the fabrication of microelectronic devices.",
