 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project equips a laboratory with scientific hardware and                   software to teach the fundamentals of motion control systems.                   This equipment is incorporated into the laboratory portion of                   the automatic control systems curriculum for Electronic                         Engineering Technology undergraduate students.   Motion                         control, along with computer technology, is the basis for much                  of the work being done to upgrade U.S. manufacturing                            capabilities.  The purpose of the laboratory equipment is to                    complete the student's understanding of the complexities of                     motion control applications.  The laboratory experiments                        complements classroom lectures and computer dynamic simulations                 of the motion control process. The hands-on experience make the                 student better able to comprehend the intricacies of the                        multifaceted physical and position feedback control systems.                    Both rotary and linear output motion are available.  Actuation                  devices are DC servomotors and stepper motors, and high                         efficiency pulse-width-modulated drive electronics are                          provided.  Measurement devices are analog and digital                           transducers (e.g. tachometers, potentiometers, resolvers, and                   encoders).  Intelligent axis cards are used to study motion                     profile capability closely related to automation applications.                  A multi-axes demonstration system is included to provide a                      complete understanding of motion control flexibility.  The                      laboratory experiments insure that the students receive a                       strong fundamental understanding of the basic principles of                     high-performance motion control.",
