 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the Department of Anthropology at                City College of the City University of New York to continue a                   Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Project which will                 involve undergraduates in the study of contemporary socio-                      cultural change among the highland Maya and Mexican national                    communities of Chiapas, southeastern Mexico.  The PI, who has                   studied work and gender in Latin America for the past thirty                    years, will direct the project.  Students will live with families               in Indian villages during a part of the week, coming in to the                  research center in the city of San Cristobal de las Casas for                   seminars, Maya language lessons, and discussion with the PI.                    Group trips to handicraft production cooperatives, experimental                 agricultural stations, and government offices will take place                   periodically in accord with the research needs of the project.                  Students will learn basic censusing techniques, extensive                       interviewing and oral narrative accounts, participant                           observation, and apprenticeship training to learn the                           socialization process in handicraft production.  They will write                daily diaries and submit a summary report at the end of the                     project.  The observations of students located in families in                   different communities will add up to an account of coping                       strategies in the debt crisis Mexico is undergoing.  The PI will                be assisted by colleagues presently working in Chiapas who have                 devoted their scholarly careers to investigations of indigenous                 culture in the area.",
