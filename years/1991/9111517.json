 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blue ribbon studies have noted the poor state of training of               students in observational aspects of atmospheric sciences.                      Previously, the Principal Investigator integrated \"hands on\"                    field experience with a formal graduate course.  This course on                 the physics of clouds included a two week field component which                 provided students with actual experience on a research aircraft                 from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).                            The Principal Investigator proposes a similar effort                       associated with studies in remote sensing.  In this case, the                   field component will include a two week field trip to the CHILL                 national radar facility at Colorado State University.  The                      students will have use of the radar with guidance being provided                by the Principal Investigator and nationally recognized radar                   meteorologists from Colorado State University and the National                  Center for Atmospheric Research.  Each student will be assigned a               research area which will include weather targets of opportunity                 as well as previously collected case studies which can be                       replayed over the radar system.",
