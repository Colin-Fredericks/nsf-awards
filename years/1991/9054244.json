 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with modern methods of recombinant DNA and                   protein analysis, procedures that underlie much of current research             and development in biotechnology.  This field has evolved rapidly               over the past dozen years, a situation that has left many                       bioscience teachers, trained in an earlier period, with little or               no immediate relevant experience.  The  project addresses this gulf             by providing college faculty with the expertise necessary to                    introduce these elements into their undergraduate programs.  An                 intense six-week practicum is at the core of the project, in which              each of the 20 participants masters the fundamental techniques.                 To provide the teachers with an authoritative base of experience                the work is conducted using equipment and procedures consistent                 with research standards.  Recognizing that college faculty must                 operate within financial and time constraints in presenting                     undergraduate courses, the workshop also investigates low-cost and              time-efficient experimental modes that are appropriate to the                   teaching setting.  In addition to developing technical skills, the              work focuses on principles underlying the methods and their                     extension to problems at the forefront of research through group                discussions held daily.  To make the connection with current                    research in the field more tangible, one day per week will be set               aside for seminars and laboratory visits conducted by faculty                   associates, who will discuss the research work as it illustrates                applications in biotechnology.",
