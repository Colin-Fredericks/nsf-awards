 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is aimed at the development of novel algorithms           for the solution of shape optimization problems in fluid dynamics.              Despite the availability of several analysis techniques for flow                problems, design techniques that are much needed from an engineering            perspective are scarce.  In a design approach, the goal is to find              the shape that gives the best performance.  The proposed work will              address the inverse problem of how to determine the system geometry             for optimum flow performance when the system behavior is described by           the steady Navier-Stokes (NS) equations.  This problem will be                  approached using ideas of constrained optimal control.  The NS                  equations and an additional set of adjoint partial differential                 equations needs to be solved.  In the proposed research, a                      computational code for the solution of the adjoint equations will be            written and an optimization algorithm will be developed.  Numerical             results will be obtained using this algorithm for several sample                problems to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.  The                   analysis and the numerical implementation will also be extended to              compressible laminar flow.  Computational implementation will be                performed on the Cray YMP of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.//",
