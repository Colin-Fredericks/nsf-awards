 "awd_abstract_narration": "All plants exist in a competitive matrix, with strong and                  weak interactions among their neighbors.  A simplistic view of                  plant competition is that the larger a plant is, the more                       competitively effective it is.  However, grassland communities                  indicate that this is not necessarily the case.  Grasslands                     evolved in the presence of drought, fire and grazing.  All of                   these external factors influence plant size, growth rate, and                   physiological activity.  The P.I. will examine the effects of                   herbivory on the competitive interactions among grasses in two                  different grassland types.  Species in the tallgrass prairie of                 central North America have not been found to compensate for                     herbivory (sensu Brown and Allen 1989) while species in the                     montane grasslands of Yellowstone National Park have been found                 to do so.  Plants which respond negatively to herbivory should be               at a competitive disadvantage while those which respond                         positively should be competitively superior.  Testing this                      hypothesis will require a combination of field and modeling work.               Community patches will be subject to different levels of                        simulated herbivory in the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge of                 Oklahoma and Yellowstone National Park.  Competition for a                      specific resource will be monitored by following uptake of stable               nitrogen isotopes between pairs of clipped/unclipped plants.                    Several species will be involved in the analyses.  Stable isotope               use will be used to determine the area that a particular target                 plant utilizes so that the number of true competitors can be                    noted and their spatial distribution can be determined.",
