 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subject of this proposal is cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), a wide             host-range plant virus for which there is very little natural                   resistance available.  The goals of this project are: (1) to                    localize sequences in the viral genome involved in the regulation               of the rate of replication, and the inhibition of replication by                high temperatures; (2) to determine the underlying mechanisms of                differential replication in plant cells (protoplast) affected by                various genetic alterations; and (3) to determine the regulatory                effects of various genetic alterations on the viral replicase in                vitro.  These goals will be achieved by using biologically-active               DNA clones of strains of CMV, that show differences in the                      regulation various aspects of CMV (and satellite) RNA replication               in several cucurbit hosts.  The sequences controlling the various               replicate-related phenotypes will be mapped by recombination and                site-directed mutagenesis of the DNA clones.  The specific                      functions altered by these sequence substitutions will be                       determined by analyses of the replication products both in in vitro             infected protoplasts, as well as of the purified viral replicase                provided with the appropriate templates and incubated under the                 experimental conditions.  These analyses will relate differences                in viral protein structure to specific functions.***//",
