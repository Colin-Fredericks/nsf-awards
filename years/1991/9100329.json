I intend to explore the area of                  regulation of RNA processing in viral systems.  I have selected the             Pasteur Institute in Paris as my first choice for several reasons.              First, the contributions from the Pasteur Institute to basic                    science research, especially in the field of virology, have been                outstanding.  From a review of the literature, it appears to me                 that their scientific community as well as their technical assets               provide an excellent resource of quality research.  Second, I                   perceive that exposure to the scientific approach of the European               community would be an experience of great benefit.  I base this                 opinion on my previous experience of moving into the mainland USA,              which has been the single most beneficial step for my scientific                and cultural life.",
