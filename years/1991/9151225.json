 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Physical Sciences of West                     Texas State University is investigating the extent to which                     classroom instruction can be effectively carried out in a                       laboratory setting using computer-assisted data acquisition and                 analysis.  During selected lectures, students are using                         personal computers, interface equipment, electronic sensors,                    and laboratory equipment to observe first-hand the physical                     systems being discussed and to demonstrate for themselves the                   interdependence of those systems' variables.  Initially, this                   portion of the project is studying the areas of motion, forces,                 fields, and thermodynamics.Equipment purchased for this project                 is also being used in regular physical science and physics                      laboratories and for student tutorials and interactive                          simulations.  Routine use of the computer lab is particularly                   important in acquainting prospective science educators with                     emerging educational technology.  The project is generating                     three comprehensive lab manuals--one for non-calculus physics                   that includes traditional experiments with modern technological                 ones, a second version that is adapted for introductory                         physical science, and a third for public school                                 application.Specific equipment being purchased with the funds                   include Gateway 3865X personal computers with disk drive and                    system software, SuperCHAMP universal interfaces, data                          acquisition and analysis software and sensors, color monitors,                  Toshiba 24-pin printers, Cenco air tracks, and a Hewlett                        Packard 6-pin plotter.NSF grant funds are being matched with                    funds from non-federal sources.",
