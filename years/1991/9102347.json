Four older, existing buildings constructed                        between 1913 and 1917 are scheduled for demolition in                           downtown Los Angeles in late December.  This group of                           buildings consists of: one 12-story building, two 4-story                       buildings, and one 7-story building, all with infill                            masonry infill walls.  These building types are                                 representative of the many hundreds, if not thousands, of                       similar buildings that exist in seismic regions in the                          U.S.                                                                                                                                                            The P.I. has been given permission by the building owners                       and local officials to test these buildings before they                         are demolished by using testing procedures on the                               building components and subassemblies that will provide                         invaluable information on their seismic load/deformation                        characteristics.  The City of Los Angeles is involved as                        a major coordinator in this project and is contributing                         donated time for participation by one of its officials.                         As the buildings will be demolished by late December,                           time is of the essence in obtaining this perishable data.                                                                                                       The research plan encompasses a testing program that                            includes:                                                                                                                                                            1.   Out of plane testing of infill walls.                                      2.   In plane testing of infill walls and material                                   properties.                                                                3.   Concrete and steel frame construction details.                             4.   Concrete encased steel frame beam/colum                                         connections.                                                               5.   Full scale building harmonic shaker vibration.                                                                                                        One major objective of this research is to document the                         steel rebar steel types/taps, etc., and the types of                            connections in the steel frames.  In addition, material                         strengths will be measured in order to develop specific                         numbers for the performance of similar existing building                        classes and construction types of the same age.  Another                        major objective will be placed on the use of                                    nondestructive testing instruments that is in current                           application by structural engineers in the Los Angeles                          region to determine the location of rebars.                                                                                                                     This project is expected to produce valuable results for                        the advancement of earthquake engineering research in the                       investigation of the older, existing building problem.",
