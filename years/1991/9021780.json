 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Canisius College for the repair and renovation of the Health                    Science Building which houses the research and research training                activities of the Biology Department.  This building was                        constructed in 1924 and last renovated in 1969.  The ARFMP grant                of $664,513 and $664,513 provided by the grantee as cost sharing                will be used to modernize these research and research training                  facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                  current research infrastructure by upgrading all existing                       laboratories with basic bench services, emergency power, and fume               hoods; by modifying the animal unit to insure compliance with                   appropriate state and federal regulations; and by renovating the                heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system.                                                                                                       This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of biological                 research and for the training of quality undergraduate students.                The renovation is expected to enhance the continuing trend of the               last decade at Canisius College of increasing undergraduate                     participation in research as part of their educational process.                 The emphasis on time spent doing research at Canisius which has                 had a major impact in directing students' interests toward careers              in science.",
