 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed at establishing the conditions for the                adsorption/desorption phase transition for polyelectrolytes at the              solid/solution interface.  A primary goal is to provide a                       comprehensive set of data to examine some of the extensive                      theoretical work on polyelectrolyte adsorption, which has not yet               been fully tested, and to stimulate further development of theory.              Guided by recent theory, the effect on the adsorption transition of             variables such as the surface charge, polymer charge, supporting                electrolyte concentration, temperature and molecular weight will be             examined in detail.  The principal means of regulating the surface              charge will be through in situ potentiostatic control of the                    electrical double-layer.  Care will be taken to produce surfaces                with well-defined morphology so that the theory may be tested with              confidence.  The thickness of adsorbed polymer films, as well as                the mode of attachment of polyelectrolyte molecules, will be                    examined by ellipsometry and surface enhanced Raman scattering,                 respectively.  Novel applications of techniques such as the quartz              crystal microbalance and infrared reflectance will be undertaken to             probe phase transitions in these two-dimensional systems.                       Competitive adsorption studies using charged and neutral polymers               will reveal the relative importance of coulombic and non-coulombic              surface/polymer interactions.                                                                                                                                   This research could potentially lead to advances in electronic                  materials, biomolecular materials, and improvements in flocculants              for water purification.",
