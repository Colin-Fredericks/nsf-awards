The case when more than one Landau level                            forms a trajectory network at the Fermi energy will be                          considered in order to understand the role of edge                              states in the transport properties at weaker magnetic                           fields.  The researchers intend to study possible non-                          linear effects that can appear at high current densities;                       what measurable physical quantity is connected with the                         integer quantum number s in the quantum case where                              energy gaps appear at filling factors determined by                             integers s and o; and the relationship between the                              semiclassical picture of open and closed trajectories                           and the quantum energy spectrum.  The researchers'                              efforts are expected to produce insight into transport                          properties in a magnetic field and to develop a theory                          based on the transmission matrix approach.                                                                                                                      This project in condensed matter theory fulfills the                            program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                          enabling leading experts in the United States and                               Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                        research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                           and competence.",
