 "awd_abstract_narration": "An analytic method frequently used in geography and many other             scientific disciplines is to calculate the statistical expression of            an \"expected\" relationship and then to compare measurements of actual           observations with values that would be expected if the statistical              expression was accurate.  Differences between the real and expected             values are termed residuals; through analysis of the pattern of                 residuals, investigators often can detect other systematic regularities         in the relationships among different variables.  This project will              explore new methods of measuring and analyzing the regularities in              residuals, focusing on different types of systematic variation that             commonly occur in data gathered at different time periods for different         geographic locations or for other observational units.  Techniques have         been developed for dealing with heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation,         two situations in which normal statistical assumptions related to the           independence of observations and their variances are violated.                  Relatively little attention has been given to a third form of                   systematic variability, contemporaneous correlation, which measures             how observations for specific observational units vary together over            time.  The investigator will focus his attention in this project on the         refinement of statistics for measuring cross-sectional                          heteroscedasticity, longitudinal autocorrelation, and contemporaneous           correlation.  Development of these statistics will focus on their               application for two lines of inquiry:  (1) empirical modelling of               interstate migration rates, and (2) estimation of future expected               warranty claims based on actuarial approaches.                                       This project will advance statistical methods for the analysis of          data relating three or more dimensions, especially longitudinal spatial         data.  It will result in new measures for evaluating patterns of                residuals, measures that will be useful for retroactive modelling and           for forecasting.  Although primarily methodological in emphasis, the            project also will generate new insights into specific types of                  inquiries.  It will provide a means for relating gravity models and             Markovian models in migration studies, and it will enhance the utility          of cross-sectional data in the determination of warranty contracts.",
