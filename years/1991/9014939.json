 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Edward Cotter of Bucknell University and Dr. Patrick Conaghan                   of Macquarie University, Australia. The proposed research                       will attempt to determine whether small-scale (fifth- or                        sixth-order) sea-level fluctations were experienced worldwide                   during Late Devonian time, thereby contributing to the debate                   concerning whether such cycles in North America and Europe                      were caused by eustatic (world-wide) or more local tectonic                     processes.  The basic approach is to investigate marine and                     marginal-marine sedimentary sequences in the Upper Devonian                     succession (Lambie Group) of the Lachlan Fold Belt in                           southeastern Australia to determine whether they contain                        rhythmic patterns, one to ten meters thick, showing cyclically                  alternating changes of depth. If such rhythmic alternations                     of water depth are found, calculation of the periodicities of                   such changes will permit comparison with the periodicities                      determined for contemporaneous (Fransnian-Famennian) sequences                  in the Appalachian Basin of North America. Should the                           southeastern Australian periodicities center around 100,000                     years, as is the case in North America, not only will this                      support a eustatic control of cycle development, but it                         reinforces the idea that eustasy was related to Milankovitch-                   type orbital variations. However, if small-scale cycles of                      change in relative water depth are not in the Lambie Group                      and its correlatives in southeastern Australia, it will be                      much more difficult to argue for eustasy as the control on                      the cycles in North America.                                                                                                                                    This project represents excellent collaboration between the                     New Zealand group which has made major contributions to                         knowledge of the patterns of sedimentation that result from                     interaction of tectonic plates and the Cotter work on whether                   small-scale sea fluctuations during Late Devonian time were                     eustatic.  This is important work which will contribute to the                  debate concerning whether such cycles in North America and                      Europe were caused by eustatic or more local tectonic                           processes.",
