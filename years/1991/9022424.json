 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the light of current concern about scientific integrity,                     scrutiny of scientific practices that are thought to insure                     integrity takes on special importance.  This is the starting                    point for examining data sharing practices in different                         scientific fields.  But other values motivate inquiry as well:                  an interest in maximum use of data and efficient use of federal                 funding.  At the same time, little is known about data sharing                  practices and their relative merits. This research project                      addresses all of these concerns and will begin to answer                        questions about (1) what are the current practices; (2) what are                the outcomes of data sharing practices; and (3) what factors                    facilitate or impede sharing.  Using a sample of completed NSF                  research grants in the biological and social sciences, the                      investigators will develop fifty case studies based on document                 review, content analysis, and semi-structured interviews.  Alert                to the great variety of forms that data can assume, the                         researchers will select projects completed since 1983 so as to                  gain information about the outcomes of NSF's own policies and                   directives.  The picture of current practices which is the                      intended product of this research will be used to devise a                      research plan for large-scale quantitative research on data                     sharing practices and outcomes.  The project will include                       development and pre-testing of instruments for collecting data in               a large-scale study.                                                                                                                                            This proposal is a reasonable request for support to enable                     highly qualified scholars to address issues about integrity in                  research and efficient use of data by an examination of data                    sharing practices.  The research plan is well designed to produce               empirical findings relevant to research ethics and useful for                   assessing NSF policies and for devising a large-scale,                          quantitative study.  Institutional support is very good.  The                   findings are likely to reach well-targeted audiences.  Support is               highly recommended.",
