 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Faculty Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers                  recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching                 and scholarship, as well as potential for continued significant                 contributions to scientific research, the academic profession,                  and the education of future scientists and engineers. Dr. Stacy's               research focuses on developing innovative methods for the                       synthesis of new classes of superconducting oxides.                                  The discovery of superconductivity in copper oxides above 77               K has captured our imagination with the potential to                            revolutionize technology; scientists anticipate that with these                 materials it will be possible to provide cheaper power, high                    field magnets for medical applications, computers with higher                   speeds, and ultra-sensitive detectors. Unfortunately, all of the                known high temperature superconductors are difficult to process                 into forms suitable for these applications. Because processing is               intimately related to applicability, it is essential that                       materials and synthetic methods be developed simultaneously with                the hope of finding new classes of superconductors which are                    easier to process. The goal of this research is to search for new               high temperature superconductors by developing methods for the                  synthesis of quaternary metal oxides. We have discovered that                   fused hydroxides are ideal for the preparation of cuprate                       superconductors at temperatures as low as 350 degrees Centigrade.               Among the many advantages of this new route are selective                       precipitation of the products at relatively low temperatures, and               simplicity in the formation of solid oxide materials. Moreover,                 over a dozen new cuprates and bismuthates have been crystallized                by varying the solution conditions, such as concentrations of                   reactants, acidity, and temperature, and by varying the                         atmosphere over the melt. The characterization of these new                     compounds has made it possible to gain a better understanding of                the electronic properties of oxides. It is planned to continue a                systematic investigation of the use of hydroxide melts for the                  synthesis of new oxides, extend the work on cuprates and                        bismuthates to early transition metal oxides, and search for new                oxides containing niobium.  A wide range of hydroxides and                      conditions will be explored.  It is believed that as the                        chemistry of this synthetic method is elucidated, it will be                    possible to select conditions that favor particular structural                  features in the solids that are crystallized. The structures of                 all new compounds will be determined by X-ray diffractions                      methods.  The magnetic and electronic properties will be measured               to test for superconductivity, and to gain a more thorough                      understanding of structure-property relationships.",
