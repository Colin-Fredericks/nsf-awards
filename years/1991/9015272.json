 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motion stability and statistical properties                                     of the response of long-span bridges under                                      turbulent wind excitations are investigated                                     experimentally and theoretically in this                                        project.  Experimental investigation is                                         conducted on bridge sectional models in a                                       water-channel facility.  Similarity                                             requirements between a model and the                                            prototype are met by suitably proportioning                                     the model, and by connecting the model to                                       heavy cylinders which are located in the air                                    chambers outside the water channel.  Fluid                                      forces induced by the structural motion are                                     measured when a model is programmed to                                          oscillate sinusoidally in a given mode                                          through a range of frequencies.  Both the                                       coupled type forces (e.g. lift induced by the                                   torsional motion), and the uncoupled type                                       forces (e.g. lift induced by the vertical                                       bending motion) are measured.  Theoretical                                      models for bridge motion are then formulated                                    to incorporate such experimentally determined                                   fluid-force generating mechanisms, and motion                                   stability boundaries and structural responses                                   are computed for the theoretical models.                                        Finally, the theoretical predictions are                                        compared with another set of experimental                                       results obtained when a structural model is                                     excited by fluid flows of specified mean                                        velocities and turbulence levels.  The                                          comparison provides a basis for further                                         refinement of theoretical models.  Flow                                         visualization experiments are also conducted                                    to gain fundamental insights into structure-                                    fluid interaction.  The velocity field                                          obtained from flow visualization provides                                       additional means for calculating the fluid                                      forces on structural models.",
