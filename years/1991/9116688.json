 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Owens River at Long Valley follows the caldera's moat                  around the N and E sides of the resurgent dome and shows geomorphic             evidence that its course has been modified by uplift of the dome                over a period of time considerably longer than the last ten years.              In most of its lower 15km, the river consists of two parallel                   meander belts separated by a nearly planar interfluvial surface                 (200-300m wide) that shows no trace of recent river activity.  The              two belts display essentially identical meander amplitude and                   wavelength, but are not the same age.  The older meander belt, now              carrying a small underfit stream, invariably lies closer to the                 dome than the main flow in the new outboard channel, and sits some              30-60 cm higher in elevation.  The river apparently jumped into the             new channel after some period of lateral tilting.  Projection of                the interfluvial surface to the axis of the some suggests that                  total uplift of 15 to 35 meters may have occurred.  In the                      lowermost six km of its course, the Owens River floodplain shows                as many as six identifiable meander belts of different age (some                lying outboard and other lying well inboard of the modern channel)              that appear to record events of subsidence as well as resurgence.               Knowing the absolute ages of the river's occupancy of each of these             meander belts may provide us an estimate of the timing of the                   resurgence and subsidence of the dome.  We are particularly                     interested to know whether eruptive activity in the Mono Craters                and Inyo Craters north of the caldera has been tied in a temporal               way to the migratory behavior of the Owens River channel, and thus              possible to the resurgence and subsidence of the crate floor.",
