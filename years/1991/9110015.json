 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project carries out work on three topics pertaining to the                 time series implications of a variety of dynamic models in                      economics and finance.  Research under the first topic is aimed                 at developing and applying new methods of estimation and                        inference for nonlinear continuous time processes.  These methods               will be used to study alternative continuous time models of asset               pricing.  Research under the second topic will assess the                       performance of a variety of stochastic discount factor models of                asset pricing.  New diagnostics for dynamic asset pricing models                will be developed, new measures of the magnitude of specification               errors for a variety of such models will be provided, and new                   methods of identification and estimation will be explored.  The                 third topic will continue development of model solution methods                 for and quantitative analysis of a rich class of recursive linear               models of dynamic economies.  Within the context of these models,               there will be investigations of optimal dynamic taxation,                       seasonality, aggregation-over-time and income distribution.                                                                                                     This project has had an enormous influence on the way empirical                 research is conducted in economics.  The investigator, in                       collaboration with others, has developed new methods for using                  data to rigorously estimate dynamic economic relationships that                 now dominate most empirical research in economics.  This project                builds on the results of past research by developing better                     methods for studying dynamics in such areas of research as asset                pricing, taxation and income distribution.  The project                         undertakes a new line of research on nonlinear models of                        continuous time processes.  This is important because econometric               and statistical methods designed for estimating or testing the                  extensive body of theoretical research on these models have been                slow to develop.  This project will expand the existing set of                  methods and use them to obtain important new substantive insights               into the performance of security markets.",
