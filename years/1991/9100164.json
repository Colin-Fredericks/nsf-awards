 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most plant communities are comprised of many different                     growth forms with one that usually dominates in biomass.                        Ecological studies tend to focus on the dominant growth form and                species, primarily because they process most of the energy that                 flows through the system.  However, when species richness is                    considered, it is usually species within the subordinate growth                 forms that contribute most to diversity.  With the exception of                 ruderal species, relatively little is known about the mechanisms                by which subordinate species, especially long-lived perennials,                 maintain themselves in communities.  A comprehensive evaluation                 of the mechanisms of persistence of these less common species is                critical to maintaining diversity within natural and restored                   communities.                                                                         This study will experimentally examine the mechanisms of                   persistence of tallgrass prairies forbs (non-woody, perennial                   herbs) at the Konza Prairie Research Natural Area.  This site is                characterized primarily by just two growth forms (the dominant                  grasses and forbs) and this facilitates comparisons of resource                 use and responses to fire, grazing, light regime, and nitrogen                  between dominant and subordinate growth forms.  The forbs share                 many life history characteristics and owe their persistence                     within the tallgrass matrix to the long residence times of                      established individuals/clones.  A combination of descriptive                   studies and a full factorial experiment involving water, N and                  light manipulations will be used to elucidate the processes by                  which long-lived forbs maintain their presence in a \"sea of                     grass\" that varies topographically and in fire history.",
