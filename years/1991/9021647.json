ELM holds that affect                    influences the amount and direction of persuasion by different                  processes in different situations.  That is, peoples' moods and                 feelings can influence attitudes by (a) serving as simple cues;                 (b) providing issue-relevant information; (c) affecting the                     extent of information processing activity, and (d) influencing                  the nature of the thoughts that come to mind as a message is                    processed.  Affect is postulated to have different effects                      depending upon a message recipient's overall motivation and                     ability to think about the communication.                                                                                                                       Experiments will be conducted to examine the different roles that               a person's affective state can play in the persuasion process                   under different elaboration likelihood conditions.  These are the               critical experiments for testing the potential utility of the ELM               for understanding the role of a person's transient moods and                    emotions in persuasion.  When this research has been completed,                 we will have a better understanding of the link between affect                  and persuasion.",
