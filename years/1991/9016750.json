 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a cooperative research project in                       \"Theoretical and Phenomenological Studies in Elementary                         Particle Physics\" between a group at the University of Hawaii                   at Manoa led by Professor Sandip Pakvasa and a group of                         Japanese scientists from the University of Tsukuba, the                         National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK), and                          Tohoku University.  Professor Yasuo Hara, Institute of                          Physics, University of Tsukuba, is the leader of the Japanese                   group. Together the scientists will pursue joint investigations                 into areas of intense current activity in theoretical                           physics.  One of the main topics will be studies of mixing, CP                  violation and rare decays of mesons.  Related topics of                         interest are methods of calculation of weak decays with focus                   on chiral  symmetry.  Another class of phenomema to be studied                  is testing of gauge structure of electro-weak theories,                         extensions beyond the standard model, the nature of the                         symmetry-breaking mechanism, and the search for new particles.                                                                                                  Many members of the U.S. and Japanese groups have collaborated                  in the past.  Their studies will have implications  for                         future high energy machines such as SSC and also the TeV                        Linear Colliders currently under study in Japan at KEK and at                   SLAC in the United States.  The groups also have  strong                        interest in neutrino masses, mixings and oscillations, and                      will study the implications of solar and atmospheric                            neutrino date of Kamiokande and other experiments for their                     implications, as well as neutrinos and axions in astrophysics                   and the early universe.",
