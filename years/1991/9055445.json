 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project from Cal State L.A. is designed to educate                         teachers to be leaders of hands-on science instruction in                       their elementary schools.  The two workshops will train a                       total of fifty teachers to become science mentor specialists                    in using hands-on science materials and to understand the                       physical science concepts appropriate for elementary schools.                   The workshops will provide the mentor teachers with lesson                      plans and well-organized kits of materials for each hands-on                    unit, as well as raining in the use of these materials and                      how to educate teachers about them.  The mentors will                           correlate the physical science units their school curriculum                    and inservice teaches at each grade level.  There will be two                   teachers from each school represented so that each teacher                      will inservice half of the teachers at their school.  Thus                      the program will develop a total school program of hands on                     physical science.  Each participating school will provide a                     stipend to the teacher for conducting the inservice of their                    colleagues, release time for such activity, and cost share                      the science kits which will be given to each school.  Project                   evaluation, problem sharing, and long range planning will be                    accomplished at two support sessions for all mentor teachers                    scheduled during the school year.  Additional support will                      also be provided by the PIs at their individual schools                         during the year as they attempt to improve the teaching of                      science in their school.                                                                                                                                        The cost sharing will be 38% of the NSF portion.",
