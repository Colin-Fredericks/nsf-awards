 "awd_abstract_narration": "American voters increasing are portrayed as individuals more                    concerned with the personalities and images of candidates than with             candidate ideologies or issue positions.  This proposal draws on                recent research in cognitive psychology to develop and test an                  explanation of this trend.  Specifically, this research develops                a model of candidate evaluation which view voters as \"cognitive                 misers\" in the sense that they attempt to strike a balance between              the amount of thought they invest in their voting decision and the              likely ability of thought to predict candidate's future behavior.               Since candidates intentionally obscure their policy positions and               given the decreasing distinction between the parties in most                    voters' minds, this model predicts that voters will rely                        increasingly on personalities in evaluating candidates.                                                                                                         A series of laboratory experiments will be undertaken to test this              interpretation. Subjects will be exposed to various types of                    information including issue positions, group affiliations,                      appearance and personality regarding competing hypothetical                     candidates.  The effects on candidate evaluation will then be                   tested.                                                                                                                                                         When completed this innovative research will help determine not                 only the influence of personality on candidate evaluation but also              the source of those personality inferences in political                         communication.",
