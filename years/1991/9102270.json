 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Pamela Chu has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                         Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Chu's doctoral degree was from                    the University of California at Berkeley under the supervision                  of Professor Yuan Lee. Dr. Chu intends to continue research at                  the National Institute of Standards and Technology under the                    sponsorship of Dr. Richard Cavanagh. Dr. Chu's area of                          postdoctoral research will be the photoexcitation and                           fragmentation/desorption mechanisms of metal carbonyls on metal                 and semiconductor substrates. Longer term, she plans to study                   laser-induced photochemistry at surfaces and surface-mediated                   reactions probed by two-photon photoemission.                                   %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                    meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
