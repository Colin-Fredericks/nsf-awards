 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with evolutionary game theory.  It has                two objectives: to explore the evolution of optimizing behavior and             of attitudes toward risk.  A basic presumption in economics is that             agents optimize.  This project examines this presumption by asking              whether evolutionary (and other dynamic) forces will lead to the                extinction of non-optimizing behavior.  In particular, the authors              will search for conditions under which evolutionary forces do                   select for optimizing behavior; and they will also explore what                 form of non-optimizing behavior does survive (in environments which             are plausible but not sufficient to guarantee the extinction of                 non-optimizing behavior).  More specifically, the interaction of                learning and evolutionary forces in the selection of rules rather               than strategies will be investigated.  With regards to the                      evolution of attitudes towards risk it is important to know what                forms of strategic interaction lead to what attitudes towards risk.             For example, it is known that winner-takes-all games lead to                    risking-taking behavior.  This will be useful for investigating,                for instance, what forms of market interaction will lead to                     excessive risk taking behavior.  This research is important because             it will improve our understanding of the evolution of optimizing                behavior and of attitudes toward risk.",
