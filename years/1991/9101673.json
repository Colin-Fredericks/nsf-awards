The program's awards provide opportunities for                     joint research, and the use of unique or complementary                          facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                       This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral                             research visit by Dr. Janet Waldeck of the University of                        Pittsburgh with Dr. Moshe Shapiro of the Weizmann Institute                     of Science, Rehovot, Israel.  The researchers plan to                           develop a fully three-dimensional quantum mechanical method                     for calculating photodissociation branching ratios.  An                         understanding of the natural photodissociation dynamics is                      essential to devising experimental schemes by which                             electronic branching can be controlled.  Recently, Dr.                          Shapiro developed a theory for coherent control of reactions                    which relies on the fact that control over reaction yield                       can occur via quantum interference induced by using several                     independent optical routes to the same energy E.  In order                      to apply their findings more readily to experimental                            spectra, they will examine the conditions under which                           quantum features found in the collinear case of coherent                        control survive 3D averaging.                                                                                                                                   The award recommendation provides funds to cover interna-                       tional travel, dependent's allowance, local travel abroad                       and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S.                        home institution.",
