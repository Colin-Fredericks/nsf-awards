 "awd_abstract_narration": "The netlib system was designed to send, by return electronic mail,              requested mathematical software together with subsidiary routines and           any related documents or test programs supplied by the authors.                 Since its inception, netlib has had a significant positive impact on            the infrastructure of the computational science community.  This is             evidenced by the fact that nearly 150,000 requests for netlib                   services were received in 1989 and that more than 200,000 were                  projected for 1990.                                                                                                                                             In this proposal support is requested for routine netlib operation              and expansion of its capabilities and the maintenance of NA-NET.  The           scope of netlib will be expanded to include new software, including             tools for symbolic computation.  Software will also be added which              will allow a user to access netlib interactively.. The use of a                 production rule expert system the netlib server for those users with            less expertise will be investigated.//",
