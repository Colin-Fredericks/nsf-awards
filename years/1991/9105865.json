 "awd_abstract_narration": "The failure of many forms of vegetation to regenerate                      results both from human-induced environmental change processes                  and natural processes.  Moreover, both types of impacts may be                  constrained within the normal dynamics of certain species.  In                  the case of long-lived species that are capable of cyclic                       regeneration patterns, it is necessary to conduct historical                    biogeographical studies in order to interpret their regeneration                status.  Absence of seedlings and saplings in California oak                    woodlands indicates that the present rate of oak regeneration is                insufficient to maintain existing stands.  Evidence suggests that               the failure to regenerate is a result of human-induced                          environmental change associated with European settlement.  This                 doctoral dissertation project will reconstruct the history of oak               woodlands in California over the last 500 years.  Fossil pollen                 analyses and an automated image analysis system to quantify                     changes in charcoal abundance will be used to assess the impact                 of European settlement on oak regeneration and fire frequency.                                                                                                       This project will provide a history of vegetation change                   essential to understanding changes in regeneration over time and                to evaluating the extent to which the current failure of                        California oaks to regenerate is caused by human-induced change.                This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a                   promising young scholar to continue to develop independent                      research skills.",
