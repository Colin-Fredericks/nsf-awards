 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support US participation in a US-France joint                   seminar on the topic of \"Multiple Sigma and PCP Receptor                        Ligands:  Mechanisms for Neural Modulation and Protection?\",                    to be held in Montpellier, France, in September 1991. The US                    and French organizers are: Dr. Edward Domino, Department of                     Pharmacology, University of Michigan, and Dr. Jean-Marc                         Kamenka, Ecole Nationale Superieure de Chimie, Montpellier,                     France.                                                                                                                                                         The seminar will cover the use of sigma and PCP receptor                        ligands in chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology,                          neurobehavioral sciences, psychopharmacology and toxicology.                    Their interaction with different neurotransmitters or                           modulators will be updated and the search for specific sigma                    and PCP receptor agonists and antagonists will be described.                    PCP and its derivatives are currently important molecular                       probes in many aspects of biology and are also being considered                 as novel therapy as antipsychotic, anticonvulsant and neural                    protective agents.  This seminar will bring together leading                    experts in this rapidly moving field of study and will                          provide an opportunity for valuable interactions. Results of                    the seminar will be published and are expected to be                            disseminated widely in the scientific community.",
