 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Nelsen will                 study the detailed mechanism of the reaction of alkene cation                   radicals with oxygen, and he will also investigate electronic                   interactions in compounds that contain sulfur-sulfur bonds. In                  the first part of this project, Dr. Nelsen will study carbon                    skeletal rearrangements that accompany the reaction of certain                  alkylated alkenes and dienes with ground state oxygen. These                    skeletal rearrangements cause some alkenes to produce                           five-membered ring peroxides in competition with four-membered                  rings. In the second part, experimental and theoretical studies                 will be performed that are designed to probe the influence of                   electronic effects on rotational barriers in compounds that                     contain S-S bonds.                                                              %%%                                                                             A particularly fascinating group of peroxides, called                           \"dioxetanes\", have two carbons and two oxygens linked together                  in a four-membered ring. Dr. Nelsen has developed a new type of                 reaction in which dioxetanes are produced directly from                         ground-state oxygen and alkenes via an intermediate cation                      radical. His approach permits the synthesis of new dioxetanes                   that cannot be made by other, more traditional methods for                      preparing dioxetanes. In the first part of this project, Dr.                    Nelsen will study the detailed mechanism of this process. In                    the second part, experiments will be performed that are                         designed to clarify the mechanism by which electronic                           interactions in compounds that contain sulfur-sulfur (S-S)                      bonds affect their chemistry. Since the strength of the S-S                     bond has important consequences in biological systems, the                      results of this aspect of Dr. Nelsen's overall study may have                   impact upon drug design (in addition to their fundamental                       importance to physical-organic and theoretical chemistry).",
