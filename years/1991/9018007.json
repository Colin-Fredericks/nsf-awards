 "awd_abstract_narration": "New oceanic crust forms along the mid.ocean ridge axis by a             complex interplay of magmatic, tectonic, and hydrothermal                       processes. These processes are known to vary significantly along                the axis, as manifested by the division of the ridge into                       segments bounded by transform faults and overlapping spreading                  centers. Hydrothermal venting along the mid.ocean ridge is a                    first.order process that is responsibe for much of the heat loss                from the ridge axis. This project will determine the                            distributions, relative intensity, and first.order chemical                     characteristics of hydrothermal venting along the                               morphologically, geophysically, and pertologically well.known                   segments of the East Pacific Rise between 9 03N and 11 10N by                   surveying the water column for hydrothermal plumes. This section                of the ridge was chosen because it is well.studied, and because                 it encompasses portions of mid.ocean ridge with high magma supply               as well as portions that are magmatically starved.",
