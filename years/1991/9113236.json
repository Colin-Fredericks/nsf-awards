 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed work is to develop, test and                      demonstrate a new generation of numerical methods to solve the                                                                                                  pdf equations for turbulent combustion.                                                                                                                         In several major industries, there is an increasing use of                      turbulent combustion models to aid the design and development                   of combustion devices.  The usefulness of these methods has                     already been established, but it can be significantly enhanced                                                                                                  through improvements in the modelling and computational                         implementation.  PDF methods provide the needed capability to                   handle finite-rate kinetic effects, such as the formation of                    NOx and the burning of CO.  However, the focus is not on                        modelling issues, but on the computational implementation of                    pdf methods.  Industry requires methods that are much more                      accurate, robust and economical than those currently                            available.  A radically new Monte Carlo method will be                          developed to solve the pdf equations.  It will be second-order                                                                                                  accurate in space and time; it will include a PISO-type mean                    pressure algorithm applicable both to low-speed and high-speed                                                                                                  flow; it will incorporate advanced variance-reduction                           techniques (to reduce statistical errors); and, it will be                      structured for implementation on vector and parallel                            architectures.",
