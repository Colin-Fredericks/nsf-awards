Support is requested for 1) a half-                   time Project Director and secretary, a Summer Program                           Coordinator and Staff, and Academic Tutors; 2) funds for staff                  travel to implement and coordinate the program and student                      travel for enrichment activities; 3) instructional supplies to                  include instructional software in advanced subject areas and                    lab equipment to enrich course work; 4) financial assistance                    to students of $2500 per year; 5) funds for recruitment                         activities and materials to attract Navajo students into                        science fields, and 6) computer equipment and software for                      tracking and evaluation of the program.  In addition the                        college will be requesting $127,040 in matching funds from                      various private industry sources as well as Lawrence Livermore                  and Los Alamos National Laboratories.                                                This support will result in the recruitment of 10                          academically well qualified students each year to the Shiprock                  campus of the Navajo Community College in science fields where                  they will be prepared through a special summer program to                       enable them to succeed.  Financial assistance will be provided,                 as well as travel funds to visit local industry, National labs,                 and the trip to the Annual Meeting of the American Indian                       Science and Engineering Society.  The following summers the                     students will be placed in job experiences in local industry,                   research ongoing at the college or at National lab sites in New                 Mexico and California.  Some placements may be in programs at                   other colleges and universities.  A special feature of the                      program is the academic tutoring to be provided by junior level                 university students doing a cooperative education project at                    Navajo Community College.  Another feature is the adaptation                    of the summer institute program from the California Polytechnic                 State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) to the Navajo                    setting, and the close cooperation between Navajo Community                     College and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in visits,                   internships, long-term equipment loans, and other advice and                    collaboration.",
