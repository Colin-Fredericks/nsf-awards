 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is introducing students within the three-semester                  calculus-based introductory physics course at Southwest Texas                   State University to the utility of the computer in the                          laboratory. With each course the level of sophistication of                     computer use by the student increases concurrently with their                   development of mathematical expertise as they progress from one                 level to the next.Each laboratory station is provided with an                   IBM PS/2, Model 30 computer. Complete Pasco Experiment Systems                  in Mechanics, Wave Motion, Optics and Nuclear Physics with                      software and interfaces are used by students in the first and                   second semester laboratories. The second and third semester                     laboratory students use Lab Windows software development and                    data analysis tools, Lab-PC I/0 interface boards, and signal                    conditioning modules.As one indication of Southwest Texas State                 University's commitment to the project, the University is                       providing a two-to- one match of NSF funds.",
