 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will design and experiment with a new generation                   operating system that supports the construction of distributed                  applications from a collection of building block pieces.  The approach          is based on the observation that communication objects are the key to           accessing services and resources in a distributed environment.  In              such an environment, users specify what services and resources they             want to access, and the operating system dynamically loads the                  communication objects necessary to access those services and                    resources.                                                                      At the heart of the system is an object infrastructure.  This                   infrastructure has two important features.  First, it is independent            of the user/kernel boundary.  That is, the component objects can                reside in either the kernel or in one or more user address spaces, and          objects can easily be migrated between address spaces.  Thus, new               objects can be built and tested in user address spaces for protection           reasons, and later migrated into the kernel for performance reasons.            Second, the kernel itself is dynamically configurable.  That is,                objects can be loaded into (and deleted from) the kernel at runtime as          required by the active applications.  This feature means that kernel            size is not a dominant factor--all trusted communication objects can            reside in the kernel while they are being used.                                 Within this context, the proposal has two major themes:                                                                                                           -Designing operating system support for dynamically composable                   communication services, including implementation techniques                     that support fast communication on shared-memory multiprocessors                                                                                                                                                                               -Investigating various decompositions of distributed systems into                primitive building blocks, and understanding the principles that                govern how those building blocks are composed to provide higher-                level services.",
