The evidence is being sought in the                                             accelerograms recorded during the 1979                                          Imperial Valley earthquake.                                                                                                                                     During this earthquake, accelerogram records                                    were obtained of the strong ground motion at                                    the Differential Array station and at the                                       Array No.1 free-field location.  These                                          records are being analyzed in detail to                                         determine the time-dependent character of the                                   apparent stiffness reduction of the                                             underlying soil during this event.                                                                                                                              The analysis consists of: (1) Dividing each                                     of the two accelerograms into several time                                      windows representing (a) the weak motion                                        prior to the S-wave arrival, (b) the initial                                    portion of strong shaking beginning with S-                                     wave arrival, (c) the middle and latter                                         portions of strong shaking, and (d) the                                         weaker motions at the ends of the records;                                      (2) computing the Fourier Amplitude Spectra                                     of each time segment in each accelerogram;                                      (3) calculating the ratio (transfer function)                                   of the Differential Array and Array No.1                                        Fourier Amplitude Spectra for each time                                         segment; (4) noting any changes in the                                          frequency at which the first prominent peak                                     in the transfer function occurs; (5)                                            estimating the associated shear-modulus                                         reductions implied by the frequency changes;                                    and (6) estimating the soil-shearing strain                                     from the integrated accelerograms and shear-                                    wave velocity profile of the underlying soil.                                                                                                                   The results of this analysis will indicate                                      the presence of any time-dependent nonlinear                                    behavior; and, if present, it will suggest                                      whether this behavior occurred gradually or                                     suddenly; and whether during the end of the                                     shaking the shear-modulus of the soil                                           returned to its initial state prior to the                                      strong ground shaking.  These effects are                                       very relevant to earthquake hazard                                              mitigation.",
