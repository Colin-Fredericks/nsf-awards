 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Supreme Court is at the top of the federal judicial hierarchy,              but hierarchy does not necessarily imply control.  If the Supreme               Court is in fact to be supreme in its impact, normative legal                   theory posits that inferior courts must follow judicial policy as               determined by the Supreme Court.  Alternatively, principal-agent                theory suggests that there will be times when agents (e.g., Circuit             Courts) will shirk this responsibility and represent their own                  interests rather than the interests of their principals (e.g., the              Supreme Court).  Despite the importance of understanding court                  interaction, research on the topic has been quite limited and                   attention to a principal-agent perspective virtually non-existent.                                                                                              The theoretical and empirical work being undertaken by Dr. Segal                represents a valuable step forward.  Using principal-agent theory,              he plans to investigate the degree to which the circuit courts                  carry out Supreme Court policy versus the degree to which they                  substitute their own self-interest.  Specifically, the study will               focus on search and seizure cases from 1962 through 1990 and                    examine both the following of precedent by circuit courts and the               reviewing of circuit court decisions to correct them by the Supreme             Court.  Too little is known about the processes by which Supreme                Court decisions affect lower appellate court judges.  This study                will contribute substantially to our understanding of this                      interaction and thus to our knowledge of the adminstration of                   justice in society.",
