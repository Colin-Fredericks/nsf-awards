 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Detroit for the renovation and repair of the                      Chemistry Building which houses the research and research training              activities of the Chemistry Department.  This building was                      constructed in 1926 and last renovated in 1965.  The ARFMP grant of             $200,000 and $254,400 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will              be used to modernize these research and research training                       facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                  current research infrastructure by modifying the space, electrical              and ventilation systems, and the hood capacity and other                        furnishings of three outdated laboratory areas.  These                          modifications will result in the creation of three new                          laboratories meeting current health and safety standards which                  will be used for (1) chemical characterization and testing, (2)                 physical measurement and computation, and (3) polymer synthesis.                This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of undergraduate and graduate                  students in a department with a particular commitment to local                  outreach programs that are making a clear impact upon the                       recruitment of students, including minority students, into                      chemistry.  The renovation will encourage gifted minority students              to go into the fields of science and engineering at the University              of Detroit which has a significant enrollment of Black students.",
