 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award continues support of Tandem Mass Spectrometry activities             at the Mid Atlantic Mass Spectrometry (MAMS) laboratory at the                  University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC).  One of several                 approaches to mass spectrometry (MS), tandem MS provides high                   resolution measurements of compounds with the high molecular                    weights typical of proteins, nucleic acids and other biopolymers.               Efforts sponsored by this award will focus on improving techniques              for analysis of proteins, glycoproteins and carbohydrates using the             tandem instrument; a variety of collaborative research projects                 will be initiated or continued, and training activities at the pre-             and post doctoral level will continue.                                          Mass spectrometry plays an increasingly important role in the                   structural analysis of biomolecules.  Information about protein                 sequence and structure, including naturally occurring modifications             of proteins, and similar kinds of information about polysaccharides             and other branched chain polymers are obtained with great                       difficulty by other techniques.  The MAMS laboratory includes                   facilities at UMBC and at The Johns Hopkins University School of                Medicine.  Both were established as shared instrument resources for             collaborative and service projects.  Because of the considerable                expense of acquisition and operation of tandem MS instruments, this             type of analysis is not routinely available at most research                    institutions.  The UMBC facility provides the research community                at UMBC and at numerous other institutions with access to the kind              of skilled mass spectrometry needed in many areas of modern                     biological research.",
