 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for the development of the initial prototype of one             of the nodes of an optoelectronic interconnection network                       ultimately capable of reaching terabyte-per-second capacities.                  Such a network is a crucial component in a future teraflop,                     distributed processing system.  The required capacity is reachable              through innovations in architecture, further development of a few               devices that have been demonstrated, and careful systems                        integration.  This project describes the first stage in the                     development of a single-word transmission, multiply-connected                   network, ultimately capable of delivering and extracting a                      sustained average rate of a few 10s of Gb/s from many 100s of                   electronic hosts simultaneously.  The electronic hosts would be at              multiway low-latency optical switching nodes separated by a few                 meters to 10s of kilometers.  The techniques to be used are a hot-              potato self-routing protocol with no opto-electronic conversion,                a minimum-depth and physically flexible topology, optical packet                compression by optical wavelength and microwave subcarrier-                     division multiplexing per word, optical amplification,                          multiwavelength optical switching, and multitechnology opto-                    electronic integration and packaging.  The principal innovation is              to architect and engineer a system that exploits these strengths                simultaneously.  A large multi-year project will be staged as a                 series of mutually dependent, increasingly sophisticated system                 demonstrations and device development efforts.  This project will               construct the first rudimentary demonstration of the node in a few              months with (nearly) off-the-shelf components.",
