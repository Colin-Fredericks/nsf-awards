 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will derive                     uniform asymptotic approximations for the solutions of second-                  order linear ordinary differential equations that contain a large               parameter.  The approximations would be uniformly valid in a                    domain of the complex plane that contains a coalescing turning                  point and a simple pole.  In the beginning of the project the                   principal investigator will concentrate his efforts on                          approximating solutions of Mathieu's equation, including                        constructing realistic and explicit error bounds.  He then hopes                to extend his techniques and results to more general equations                  with turning points.                                                                 Linear, second-order ordinary differential equations are in                a real sense the building blocks for many complex theories in                   mathematical physics and asymptotic analysis.  The solutions of                 such equations are useful in their own right as the solutions of                interesting and important physical problems and equally as                      paradigms for more complicated phenomena.  In this project the                  principal investigator will seek to find accurate approximate                   solutions of such an equation, known as Mathieu's equation, that                arises in a number of applied contexts.  Its solutions are known                eponymously as Mathieu functions, and their properties are                      representative of asymptotic properties of solutions of more                    general equations involving turning-points.",
