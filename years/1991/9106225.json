 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  Under this project, Drs. John Beddow of the                       University of Iowa, and P. Ramakrishnan of the Indian                           Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB) will continue their                      cooperation in the study of powder metallurgy.  The key                         objective of this research is to seek to relate the                             characteristics of powder particles that are used to form                       powder metallurgy and ceramic products to the structure and                     properties of the sintered materials so produced under a                        variety of processing conditions.  Investigations will                          include new theories of particle characterization and                           morphological analysis of particle size and shape on the                        one hand and study of new theories of morphological texture                     analysis and new and well-established methods of sintered                       material property measurement on the other.  Empirical,                         phenomological and theoretical correlations between powder                      and sintered material will be developed and explored.  Most                     of the experimental work will be done at IITB, with the                         analysis and theoretical formulation done at IITB and the                       U. of Iowa.                                                                                                                                                     Scope:  The two scientists have been cooperating for a                          number of years with a number of joint publications in                          various refereed journals and presentations in U.S. and                         European conferences.  The area of research can lead to                         optimization of the methods used in recycling ferrous                           scrape, thus leading to important savings in material and                       energy usage.                                                                                                                                                   Funding:  The project is being supported under two grants:                      INT 9103107 to the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay;                      INT 9106225 to the University of Iowa",
