 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Rosemary Wyse at the Johns Hopkins University will use this                 award to continue her investigation of the present day kinematics               and distribution of chemical elements of the stars of our Milky Way             Galaxy.  Over 2000 stellar spectra have been obtained with support              from a prior NSF grant.  Observations will continue, but the                    emphasis will shift to the analysis of the large data set.                                                                                                      The study of galaxy formation is crucial to obtaining knowledge                 about the physics of the origin of structure in the Universe.  An               understanding of our Milky Way Galaxy, for which the most detailed              data are available, is crucial for the development and testing of               theories of galaxy formation and for the elucidation of the origins             of different morphological types of galaxies.  The Milky Way offers             a unique opportunity for study since it is the only galaxy for                  which one can determine directly and in detail the true model-                  independent three-dimensional structure, kinematics and chemical                distributions of the constituent stellar populations, by study of               individual stars.  Dr. Wyse's theoretical modeling of her new                   observational results will provide new insight into the structure               and the course of the evolution of the Galaxy.",
