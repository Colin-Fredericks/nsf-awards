 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to introduce dynamic operation,                       control and analysis into the energy laboratory via a new heat                  pump experiment that is to be developed and constructed using                   a vapor compression cycle. It consists of a 1 to 2 ton                          refrigeration compressor driven by a programmable variable                      speed drive, and arranged so that \"heat\" can be pumped in                       either direction between two identical insulated liquid filled                  tanks. Valves are provided so that the role of the evaporator                   and condenser can be reversed.  This allows a rapid cycle time                  so that several dynamic experiments can be run during the                       course of a single two hour laboratory period. The pressure,                    temperature, flow, motor speed and torque transducers will                      input to a PC via an A/D convertor so that the transient can be                 recorded and displayed, and so that data analysis can be                        performed. The students can examine how the system responds to                  changing loads, they can observe the change in COP during the                   course of the work cycle, and they can consider several control                 strategies in an effort to minimize energy consumption. A                       synergy of energy and design related concepts is emphasized in                  the experimental design.\f",
