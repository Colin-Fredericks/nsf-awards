 "awd_abstract_narration": "The standard view of the rational voter is one who votes for the                party or candidate whose positions are closest to the voter's on                those ideological or issue dimensions of importance to the voter.               In recent years, a highly sophisticated body of research has                    explored the ideological structure or \"issue space\" of voters,                  candidates, and political parties and the linkages among them.  An              important outcome of this research is a body of theory suggesting               that the success of elections in selecting candidates who are                   closest to the voters' ideal is heavily influenced by the type of               electoral system used.  To date, however, most research on spatial              theory has concentrated on American style, plurality elections                  involving only two candidates.  This award supports doctoral                    dissertation research designed to test the validity of spatial                  theories of voting in multicandidate elections such as many primary             and local non-partisan elections in the United States, and the                  national elections in other countries.                                                                                                                          When only two candidates compete for office the traditional                     American system of single member districts and plurality voting has             been shown to be sufficient to insure a good fit between election               outcomes and voter issue beliefs.  However, in multicandidate                   elections theory suggests that single member districts with                     plurality voting are likely to produce unstable equilibrium.                    Prevailing theory also suggests that adoption of majority rules                 with single member districts or the use of multimember districts                with plurality rules will solve this problem.  To test these                    theoretical predictions this project examines voting patterns in                Chile, one of the few political systems which uses both two                     candidate and multicandidate elections concurrently and thus                    provides an controlled environment in which to isolate the effects              of the different electoral systems.  An unusually rich data set on              Chilean elections already has been assembled and made available to              the Principal Investigator to facilitate this research.                                                                                                         When completed this research will enhance our understanding of                  voter decisions, the relationships between voters and candidates,               and the effect on those decision and relationships of alternative               electoral systems.  In so doing this research will provide                      important information that will facilitate evaluations of the                   effectiveness of electoral systems in the United States and                     elsewhere.",
