 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a three-year collaborative project between              Professor John B. Luchansky, Department of Food Microbiology and                Toxicology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Dr. Gerald W.                  Tannock, Department of Microbiology, University of Otago, Dunedin,              New Zealand.  The activity takes place under the U.S.-New Zealand               Cooperative Science Program.   The scientists will study the                    genetics, biology, and microbial ecology of lactobacilli,                       microorganisms that play an important role in the food fermentation             industry and in animal husbandry.  Lactobacilli have been used for              centuries for the production of some foods (e.g. certain cheeses)               and preservation of others (e.g. some meats).  The cooperating                  scientists in this study plan to utilize modern molecular biological            techniques to characterize selected lactobacilli at the molecular               genetic level.  This is expected ultimately to lead to a greater                understanding of the role of these bacilli in food systems and in               the gastrointestinal tract of mammals.  These efforts should also               facilitate the development of novel strains of the organism that                could have significant practical applications, including their use              as vectors for delivery of biologically active molecules, and as                effective agents for protection against targeted pathogenic bacteria.                                                                                           This project brings together complementary research experience and              facilities in the two countries.  Professor Luchansky has expertise             in molecular genetic techniques, and his laboratory maintains                   equipment and personnel for conducting experiments involving                    recombinant DNA methodologies of the type required for this research.           Dr. Tannock has considerable experience in studying the microbial               ecology of lactobacilli that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of              animals, and maintains a novel colony of lactobacillus-free mice                that will be very useful for evaluating the efficacy of genetically             modified strains of lactobacilli derived in this study.  The                    scientists plan reciprocal visits to each other's laboratory over               the course of the project to transfer the technologies each has                 developed.",
