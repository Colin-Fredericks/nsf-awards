 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal research objective of the State/Industry                     University Cooperative Research Center for Molecular and                        Microstructure of Composites at the Case Western Reserve University             and the University of Akron is to conduct fundamental research on               the development of ultra-performance composites through purposeful              molecular and microstructure design.  The characteristics of the                ultra-performance composites include more than 50% improvement of               properties such as fracture toughness, hardness, radar                          transparency, electromagnetic shielding, reduction of viscosity for             the ease of processing, reduced coefficient of friction, reduced                weight, cryogenic compatibility, high energy resistance, etc.                        An interdisciplinary cross-campus team will address the core               research program which includes five interactive components.  These             are:  molecular modeling, interface/interphase, characterization,               chemistry and synthesis, and processing.  Research in the non-core              program designed to promote use of developments in industry will                be initiated only as the core research projects yield technology                transferable results.  The Edison Polymer Innovation Corporation                (EPIC) will play a key role in facilitating, coordinating and                   implementing the Technology Transfer/Implementation Program which               is designed to advance Ohio's economic development and industrial               competitiveness.                                                                     Initially, the Center will have eleven large, medium and small             companies in the industrial consortium.  Company representatives                will participate in the Center's Advisory Board and Technical                   Committee.  The Director and the Associate Director of the Center               will be located at the Case Western Reserve University and                      University of Akron, respectively.  The educational program will                include:  joint advisorship of graduate students, summer program                for industry personnel.  The State of Ohio, industry and NSF will               provide matching funds totalling $750,000 in the first year.",
