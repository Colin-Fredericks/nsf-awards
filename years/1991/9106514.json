 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational geometry has developed very rapidly in the last few               years because of its applications in areas such as computer graphics,           robotics, VLSI, CAD, solid modeling and many others.  The goal of this          project is to study fundamental geometric problems that are motivated           by applied areas and to explore new areas with special emphasis on              higher-dimensional problems and on problems involving curved objects.           Since both of these areas have not received enough attention, even              very basic problems are far from being understood.  In particular,              problems in the following areas will be investigated:                                                                                                                         o    Ray shooting and hidden surface removal;                                   o    Intersection problems;                                                     o    Arrangements of curves and surfaces;                                       o    Random sampling;                                                           o    Dynamic problems; and                                                      o    Shortest paths and related problems.                                                                                                         It is expected that some of the algorithms developed during this                research will be reasonably simple.  Some of these algorithms will be           implemented in order to study their performance in practice.",
