 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Peter C. Ford of the Chemistry Department, University of                    California at Santa Barbara, is supported by the Inorganic,                     Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program for studies of the                     photochemical properties of some organometallic and                             coordination compounds of transition metals.  The first study                   will explore physical and chemical excited state deactivation                   pathways of luminescent compounds, including rhodium amines,                    chromium acetylacetonate derivatives, copper amines and                         thiocarbamates, and some inclusion compounds.  Accompanying                     theoretical models will be developed.  The second study is                      concerned with determining the chemical reactivities of                         short-lived organometallic intermediates produced as the                        primary photoproducts of excited stae reactions.  The cluster                   fragmentation of triangulo-dodecacarbonyltriruthenium(0) and a                  related alkylidyne cluster will be investigated in detail.  The                 third project is an initial photochemical study of                              nitroprusside, focused especially on the release of nitrosyl.                   Laser flash photolysis and luminescence spectroscopy are among                  the techniques which will be used.                                              %%%                                                                             These studies will provide fundamental information on mechanism                 and dynamics of excited state processes that will be useful in                  inorganic photochemistry and more generally in molecular                        engineering.  Quantitative information regarding excited states                 of metal complexes will be obtained.  The work is relevant to                   nonlinear optics, optical memory devices, photocatalysis, and                   biomedical problems.",
