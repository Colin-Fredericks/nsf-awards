 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the central importance of competition in ecological                theory, field tests of hypotheses about plant competition are                   rare.  Two current major hypotheses are the Competitive                         Equivalence Hypothesis and the Asymmetrical Competition                         Hypothesis.  No attempts have been made to apply these                          hypotheses to woody plant communities.  The P.I.s propose                       experiments that will test both the Competitive Equivalence                     Hypothesis and the Asymmetrical Competition Hypothesis using                    individuals of Betula alleghaniensis and Fagus grandifolia.  The                proposed research is based on three working hypotheses:                         1) Aboveground competition for light is of equal or greater                     importance to the growth and survival of seedlings than                         belowground competition for soil resources.  This is an                         underlying assumption of the remaining two hypotheses.                          2) Target seedlings will respond equally to equal densities of                  similar-sized neighbors of different species.  This is the                      Competitive Equivalence Hypothesis.  3) Target seedlings will                   show reductions in growth directly proportional to the sizes of                 equal densities of different-sized neighbors.  This is the null                 form of the Asymmetrical Competition Hypothesis.  The                           investigators will create replicated neighborhoods around central               target individuals by thinning existing high-density areas to                   leave neighbors of the desired density, species, and size.                      Response of target seedlings will be measured as growth in height               and stem diameter, and analyzed as relative growth rate.                        Responses will be measured over two years from the time of                      treatment.  Results will determine whether the above hypotheses                 accurately describe the competitive interactions among these                    woody species and how the species differ in their competitive                   effects on one another.",
