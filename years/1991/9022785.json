 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many practical engineering applications                               which can be described as an adaptive feedback                                  system.  The distinguishing feature of an adaptive                              feedback system is that one component in the                                    feedback loop has its parameters adapted according                              to a prescribed algorithm.  Adaptive control in                                 manufacturing systems and adaptive echo cancellers                              in telephone lines are two such examples.  Adaptive                             feedback systems are nonlinear because the recursive                            parameter adaption laws are driven by signals that                              are functions of the past adapted parameters.  Due to                           this nonlinear nature, different selections of design                           parameters, as well as different selections of adaptive                         algorithms, bring about qualitatively different types of                        behavior.  We propose to initiate an effort to discern                          and classify the types of behavior from a system                                dynamic point of view.  The tools to be employed are                            primarily standard dynamics analysis techniques that                            we, and others, have utilized before for adaptive                               systems analysis.  The expected significance of a                               carefully composed classification is in its provision of                        the fundamental knowledge for the development of                                needed qualitative design guidelines, e.g. leakage                              factor selection for avoidance of bounded instabilities                         such as bursting.  Good design is always preceded by                            good understanding of the problem and its \"solution\"                            candidates.  A well-structured taxonomy is critical to                          well-informed design choices.  Such a                                           behavior/design-oriented knowledge base will be vital                           for the future success of emerging intelligent                                  controllers.  To contribute to such an expansion of                             adaptive feedback systems theory, we propose to                                 clarify and propound our notion of a qualitative                                classification of the behavior of poorly excited                                adaptive feedback systems, and to develop some                                  prototypes for elements of this nascent taxonomy.",
