The research aims at                resolving long-standing problems with the use of speech-act                     theory in computational systems for natural language                            understanding and to provide methods of interpreting                            unconstrained discourse.  The integration of verbal and non-                    verbal speech acts are still very poorly understood and is                      critical for human-computer interactions.  This research seeks to               integrate many modalities with the study of speech acts, an                     important conceptual framework in speech and dialog processes.                  The goals are:  (1) to determine how the theory of meta-acts can                be extended and refined to model negotiations of reference and                  confirmation of mutuality of knowledge, and (2) to determine if                 meta-act models can be validated predictively.  Meta-knowledge                  models include information about conversations that are non-                    verbal, such as turn-taking.  The project derives meta-acts as a                rational strategy of action, given attributions of the                          participants' beliefs, goals and expectations at the point in the               dialogue in which the acts actually occur.  The acts are then                   expressed in a rule-based simulation of similar conversations.  A               byproduct of the research is a database of analyzed and                         transcribed data useful for other researchers.  It is expected                  that there will be substantial impact in human-computer                         interactions research and aspects of research in speech and                     natural language processing.",
