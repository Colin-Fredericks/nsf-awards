 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Richard Klein and                Kathryn Cruz-Uribe will study archaeological faunas excavated                   from two sites located in the Western Cape Province of South                    Africa.  While both date to the period immediately prior to                     European discovery of the Cape and are located only 70 km. apart,               archaeological remains differ significantly between them.  At                   Kasteelberg, domestic sheep as well as pottery are common, while                at the Dune Field Midden site both pottery and domesticates are                 rare.  Drs Klein and Cruz-Uribe will focus on the abundant faunal               remains from both sites.  They will identify these according to                 species and body part and will look for butchering marks and                    other forms of alteration.  They will also determine the ages of                animals were killed and on this basis determine the seasons                     during which the sites were occupied.  Data collected should also               shed light on the subsistence strategies practiced.                                                                                                             The first European accounts of Southern Africa indicate the                     presence of two groups of people, one which hunted and another                  which followed a pastoral way of life.  Anthropologists have                    pointed out that it is unclear whether these two distinct                       \"groups\" are actually separate or rather represent a single                     culture in which bands switch, perhaps according to season, from                one lifestyle to another.  Through analysis of two sites which                  are essentially contemporaneous and which apparently represent                  byproducts of each group, the investigators hope to insight into                this question.  If the sites are occupied in different seasons as               Drs. Klein and Cruz-Uribe suspect, the \"single group\" case will                 be strengthened.                                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed                   light on the issue of human adaptability and cultural                           variability.  Hunters and herders follow very different                         lifestyles, often with different sets of values and to switch                   from one to another over a single year is a considerable feat.                  The data themselves will be of interest to a wide archaeological                audience.",
