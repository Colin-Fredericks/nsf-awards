 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theory posits that skilled human movements, from the simplest                   pointing movements to more elaborate multi-gesture movements, are               directed by \"motor programs.\"  Although we are seldom aware of                  these programs, they act to structure commands to muscles so that               movements can be made with minimal reliance on slow, feedback-                  based, error-correcting processes.  The idea of motor-program                   generalization stems from the computer-program analogy and                      suggests that motor programs have formal parameters which take on               situation-specific values when a movement is made.  The focus of                this research is whether and how motor programs can be                          generalized so that a single representation is sufficient to                    control related, although perhaps novel, variations of a                        movement.  The research will address these issues in three                      empirical domains, handwriting, simple drawing movements, and                   aimed movements made with excess degrees of freedom.                                                                                                            The work on handwriting will examine changes in a highly                        overlearned skill when subjects are constrained to deviate from                 normal performance conditions in one or more ways: e.g., size,                  speed, or effector.  This research will identify the type and                   magnitude of constraints that necessitate a shift from the motor-               program-based, control strategy to a feedback-based strategy of                 movement approximation.  Using drawing of simple figures, the                   second line of research will  assess the nature and degree of                   transfer that occurs when people occasionally are asked to                      produce, under a particular set of constraints, a figure which                  they are learning to produce, by practicing with feedback, under                a different set of constraints.  The patterns of learning                       transfer in these experiments will provide evidence about motor                 program generalization and will provide a way to explore the                    possibility that motor programs have a hierarchical structure.                  The third line of research will investigate the strategies and                  constraints used to resolve the planning ambiguity that occurs                  when excess degrees of freedom are available to perform aimed                   movements.  Unlike the first two lines of research, which assume                an analogy to motor-program generalization based on the                         modification of pre-existing information, in this research motor                programs and their generalization will be modeled as the result                 of a process of dynamic constraint optimization.                                                                                                                The insights about the structure and function of motor programs                 gained from this research have potential for application to the                 training of skills requiring coordinated movement, the diagnosis                and treatment of movement disorders, and the planning and                       representation of movements in robotic systems.",
