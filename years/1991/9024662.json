 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past several decades, large law firms have experienced                 substantial growth.  Recent theory grounded in economic models                  attributes exponential growth rates to the existence of tournaments             in the large firm.  Essentially the theory postulates an internal               labor market in the large law firm where partners create                        appropriate incentives for associates through the organization of               tournaments.  Growth is seen as a consequence of the need to                    promote some junior members, and recruitment is seen as a                       consequence of the need to replace those who are and are not                    promoted.  Thus, the ratio of associates to partners does not                   decrease over time, and a constant promotion rate is hypothesized.              While there is evidence of this pattern in the United States, its               generalizability must be examined in a broader context.                                                                                                         An apt comparison to the U.S. case is the English experience.  The              large solicitors' firms in the United Kingdom have shown similar                patterns of growth despite differences in legal practice and in the             character and function of law.  This study systematically analyzes              the recent transformations of both American and English law firms               in order to understand what has made them grow and change and how               these developments affect the future of these firms and the legal               system in which they are set.  The project consists of three                    interrelated parts:  (1) an account of the contemporary growth and              transformation of one echelon of English solicitors' firms; (2) a               theory that portrays this transformation as a manifestation of the              underlying structure of the firm growing exponentially, and a test              of the theory; and (3) a comparison of the transformation of the                English firms with that of large American law firms.  A data set                will be constructed on the growth and hierarchical structure of                 approximately 100 English firms for a period of 75 years.  The data             will include analysis of archival materials and interviews with                 informants.  Comparable American data has been obtained by the                  investigators in prior research.                                                                                                                                This study provides a unique opportunity to account for                         organizational development within contrasting legal settings.  The              research will have both practical and theoretical importance in                 setting forth issues arising from the kinds of services law firms               are providing and the conflicts they are having with the business               world.  Analyzing the patterns of similarity and differences in the             development of the law firm in the United States and England will               illuminate the relationship between the structural characteristics              of law firms and the changing consumption of legal services in a                globalized economy.",
