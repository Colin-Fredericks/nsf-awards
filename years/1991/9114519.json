 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science and technology have been dominant and pervasive influences              in modern culture; yet they have never been generally well                      understood.  The Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science, the                Program in History of Science and Technology, the Charles Babbage               Institute for the History of Information Processing, the Department             of History of Medicine, and the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the             University of Minnesota have joined together in a coordinated                   effort to understand the operation of science and technology in our             society.  The collaborative research efforts among historians and               philosophers of science and technology center on four areas:  (I)               models, theories, and reality; (II) the history and philosophy of               physical science;  (III) the history and philosophy of biological               sciences; and (IV) interactions among science technology and                    society.                                                                                                                                                        In area I, historians and philosophers are examining scientific                 models or theories and their relation to \"reality.\"  They are                   examining the nature of scientific representations; the issues of               realism, idealization, and experimentation; the application of                  mathematics and logic in the empirical sciences; and issues in the              philosophy of cognitive science.  In area II, historians and                    philosophers are concentrating on questions in the history and                  philosophy of quantum mechanics, the nature and status of nuclear               models, the nature of light, and the interaction of theory and                  experiment in physics.  In area III, they are examining the                     interrelationship between biomedical and physical sciences; the                 institutional organization of biomedical science; and issues in                 biology, medicine and values including theories and controversies               in biomedicine, genetics and society, the enterprises of natural                history and evolutionary biology, theories of disease and public                health, and the design of clinical research.  Finally, in area IV,              they are investigating scientific and technological institutions,               ethical issues of science and technology, the interaction of theory             and experiment, and the role of government in science-technology                interactions.                                                                                                                                                   This grant over five years supports postdoctoral fellows and                    graduate students who are participating in research and training                in each of these lines of research.",
