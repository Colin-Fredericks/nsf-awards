 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in developmental                 biology between Dr. Robert Dottin, Hunter College, City                         University of New York, and Dr. Michel Veron, Pasteur                           Institute, Paris, France.  The objective of the project is to                   investigate the mechanisms by which protein kinases and                         phosphoprotein phosphatases mediate signal transduction in                      Dictyostelium.                                                                                                                                                  Signal transduction refers to the process by which extracell-                   ular stimulatory molecules, such as peptide hormones, growth                    factors and neurotransmitters, mediate intracellular events,                    such as gene induction. In Dictyostelium discoideum,                            extracellular cAMP activates genes by binding to cell surface                   receptors.  Binding of this agonist activates the synthesis                     of intracellular messengers.  For extracellular cAMP to                         induce a Dictyostelium gene, activated nuclear regulatory                       proteins must interact with regulatory regions on DNA.                          Reversible protein phosphorylation is involved in the                           activation/inactivation process.  Therefore, the two                            researchers propose to investigate by a molecular genetic                       approach the role of protein kinases and phosphoprotein                         phosphatases in the induction of genes by extracellular                         cAMP.  Dr. Veron has focused on the cloning and the expression                  of the regulatory subunit of cAMP depended kinase.  Dr.                         Dottin and his research group have identified a large number                    of clones encoding the catalytic subunit of different protein                   kinases and phosphoprotein phosphatases. Together they                          propose to characterize these clones to ascertain their                         potential roles in these signal transduction pathways.  These                   studies will help to define a fundamental process, the                          mechanisms by which cells respond to their extracellular                        environments.",
