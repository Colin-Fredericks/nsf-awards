Byers of                   the Department Chemistry of Middlebury College.  The project is                 directed towards the development of new carbon-carbon bond                      forming reactions. It will utilize 2- phenylselenyl-                            1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, such as malonates, in a free radical                  reaction with olefins. Both inter- and intramolecular processes                 will be investigated in order to gain a better understanding of                 the scope and limitations of the reaction. Based upon these                     studies, the methodology will be applied to the synthesis of                    several simple, but important classes of organic compounds,                     including amino acids, butanolides, and tetronic acids.                         %%%                                                                             This research is in the area of synthetic methodology and will                  develop a new carbon-carbon bond forming reaction, one of the                   most important classes of reactions in organic chemistry, using                 organoselenium compounds. To demonstrate the applicability of                   this methodology, it will be used to synthesize several simple,                 but important classes of organic molecules.",
