 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides for three year's support to establish a time                series of abundance and spatial pattern of pelagic birds in the                 California Current System (CCS).  The study involves a sampling                 regime that has been operational for 40 years and is already                    funded by other agencies: the cruises of the California                         Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI). Data has                already been collected for birds on 12 sequential CalCOFI                       cruises (four per year) beginning in May 1987.  Thus, the study                 will yield a continuous time series of six years length. The                    intent is to continue the project for a much longer time. This                  inexpensive project provides an ideal opportunity to study                      spatial and temporal variation of bird populations at a range of                spatial scales meaningful to their life histories. The primary                  objectives are to calculate a mean and variance in time and space               of bird abundance and dispersion based on the time series                       collected between 1987-1993.  Once the long-term patterns have                  been determined, the magnitude of variation at different temporal               scales will be examined. Long term patterns of bird abundance                   which emerge will be compared to patterns in the physical and                   biological data collected simultaneously on the cruises.",
