 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manufacturing firms that operate at more than one site can use a             variety of strategies to respond to changes in their competitive                situations.  Many strategies entail technological adjustments; others           are locational in nature.  In the U.S., locational changes have been            common mechanisms for reducing operating costs, because factors like            connections with other firms and employment costs (including wages and          workers compensation payments) vary dramatically from one locale to             another.  The degree to which these factors influence decision making in        other nations is uncertain, however.  Preliminary research conducted in         the U.S., United Kingdom, and Germany indicate that technological               adaptations are more common in other nations.  This project will expand         research on this topic through analysis of information gathered from            executives of U.S.-owned machine tool, computer, and semiconductor              manufacturers that operate in Australia.  The data will be analyzed             using multivariate statistical procedures.                                         This project will provide new information on locational and                  technological adjustments made by high-technology manufacturers in              Australia.  Because the data collected during this project parallel             those gathered in other nations, they also will establish a sound basis         for cross-national comparisons of industrial adjustment.",
