 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structures and reactions of unusual radical cations will be                 investigated. A variety of organic radical cations will be                      generated in a range of media, including fluid solutions, frozen                glasses, and solid supports, e.g., zeolites, by appropriate                     methods, including photo-induced electron transfer, chemical                    oxidation, and radiolysis. Their structures and reactions will be               examined by a variety of modern spectroscopic methods, including                steady-state and time-resolved optical and electron spin resonance              spectroscopy. In addition, CIDNP and two-photon (radical cation                 photochemistry) will be used to monitor these reactions. The                    intermediates will be probed by a range of reagents designed to                 intercept the unpaired spin (free radical addition), the charge                 (nucleophilic capture), or both functions (cycloaddition of                     superoxide or semiquinone anion). The influence of surface                      interactions and external constraints on the three-dimensional                  structures of radical cations and their rearrangements will be                  probed by adsorbing the substrate on the microscopic surfaces of                solid supports or sequestering in the three-dimensional enclaves                of zeolites.                                                                    %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of               Professor Heinz D. Roth at Rutgers University. Radical cations are              derived from neutral molecules by the loss of an electron to give               a reactive intermediate with one unit of positive charge and one                unpaired electron. Electrons in stable molecules are paired, while              the reactive intermediates with unpaired electrons are referred to              as free radicals. In this research, structures of unusual radical               cations will be determined by modern instrumental methods and the               reactions of these intermediates will be studied as well. Various               chemical reactions will be used to intercept these reactive                     intermediates, and thereby determine their structures. The                      influence of surface interactions and external constraints on the               reactions of these radical cations will also be investigated.",
