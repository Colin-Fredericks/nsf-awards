 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new device structure, a collinear asymmetrical directional coupler            using In2O3/InxSn1-xOy heterostructure thin film, is introduced which           will decrease the power consumption needed to obtain full intensity             modulation, is adaptable to any substrate, has a high multiplexing              capability, and will potentially give yield to a new line of both               electro-optic and all-optic devices.  Conventional coplanar                     directional couplers must have waveguides of exactly equal widths               which is extremely difficult to achieve.  We will eliminate the                 stringent waveguide channel tolerance requirements through a variable           guided mode effective index technique.  Unlike the III-V and II-VI              compound semiconductor heterostructure, the In2O3/InxSn1-xOy film can           be grown on any surface.  Therefore, an active device can be built on           an array of substrate materials.  The In2O3/InxSn1-xOy has a                    transparent bandwidth from 400 nm to mid-infrared.  A large number of           optical wavelengths can also be multiplexed.                                                                                                                    Finally, the index modulation of In2O3/InxSn1-xSn1-xOy film is brought          about by carrier injection.  Consequently, both electro-optic and all           optical devices can be realized based on the novel concept.  The index          modulation with carrier injection is two orders of magnitude higher             than with the linear electro-optic effect.  The interaction length is           expected to be compatible with multi-quantum well devices.",
