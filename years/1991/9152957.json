 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of laboratory instructional instrumentation allows                  a quantum improvement to be made in the quality of applied                      optics instruction offered to Cornell engineering students by                   the Engineering Physics program at Cornell.  The equipment                      yeilds substantial and material improvement in the                              instructional and laboratory content of an existing, and                        already quite successful, laboratory course on \"The Laser and                   Its Applications in Science, Technology and Medicine\", a course                 which is currently taken by 25% of all Cornell engineering                      students. It is our contention that students more easily grasp                  difficult concepts in modern optics if they have hands-on                       experience with these tools and are exposed to experiments that                 vividly illustrate particular principles.  Experiments are                      being developed that demonstrate short optical pulse and low                    light level detection, dye laser tuning, Raman scattering, and                  spectroscopic \"finger printing\".The motivation behind our                       objective is simple; the extensive use of advanced optics, and                  lasers in particular, is pervasive in almost all scientific and                 engineering disciplines and is rapidly growing. Despite this                    fact and the widely published forecasts of the coming photonics                 revolution in the next century, minimal attention is generally                  given to the adequate education of significant number of U.S.                   engineering undergraduates in the principles underlying applied                 optics, and in the practical use of these optical tools.",
