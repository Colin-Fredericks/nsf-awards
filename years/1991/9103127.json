 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elliptic boundary value problems occur in many                                  disciplines.  In cases where the boundaries are                                 complex and irregular, these problems are recast as                             integral equations and solved by boundary integral                              equation methods.  This technique requires the                                  solution of a linear system.  In many problems of                               practical interest these systems are large enough                               that the computational effort required for their                                solution is prohibitive.  In recent years, vector                               supercomputers have expanded the range of                                       problems which may be solved numerically but                                    there remains a significant number of problems                                  which lie beyond current capabilities.  The                                     combination of parallel supercomputers and                                      powerful iterative methods holds the promise of                                 expanding the territory of solvable problems.  This                             SGER project addresses both aspects of this                                     combination.  An O(N) algorithm which was                                       recently implemented on serial and vector machines                              will be implemented on a parallel architecture, and                             the existing repertoire of iterative methods will be                            expanded to uniquely augment the power of the                                   O(N) algorithm.",
