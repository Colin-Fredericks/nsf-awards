 "awd_abstract_narration": "The coordination chemistry of dinuclear cationic transition                     metal complexes of molybdenum and tungsten  with formal charges                 of four to ten will be explored through synthesis and                           structural methods.  Kinetic and mechanistic studies of ligand                  substitution reactions and the organometallic chemistry of                      dinuclear metal centers will be initiated.  These results may                   differ substantially from the thoroughly investigated                           mononuclear complexes due to the influence of the metal-metal                   bond.  Ordered assemblies such as liquid crystals and polymers                  formed by use of dinuclear metal multiple bonds as building                     blocks will be investigated, with emphasis on the controllable                  magnetic, optical, and electronic properties of these                           macromolecular systems.  The dinuclear precursors have first                    ionization potentials that vary by two volts depending on metal                 and the substituents; these features should allow a large array                 of macromolecular systems with tunable electronic properties.                   %%%                                                                             In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                             Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Malcolm                   H. Chisholm of Indiana University will continue his studies of                  the rich chemistry of dinuclear complexes of molybdenum and                     tungsten.  These molecules show considerable promise as                         homogeneous catalysts.  In addition, they can be assembled                      under proper conditions to form liquid crystals and polymers                    that may have useful properties as new materials.",
