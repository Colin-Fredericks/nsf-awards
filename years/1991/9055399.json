 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fairfield University seeks funds for a three-year program                       for 24 mathematics teachers to improve their mathematical                       understanding and pedagogical practices.  The program                           consists of six semesters of Saturday courses presenting a                      chronological development of mathematics with heavy emphasis                    on participant discovery of mathematical concepts,                              accompanying computer laboratories, familiarizing                               participants with appropriate software, a computer network                      linking participants via BITNET for extramural electronic                       mail communication, participant development of curricular                       units, and participant-hosted Fall conferences for                              colleagues.  The evolution of logic, set theory and discrete                    mathematics, of geometry -- both Euclidean and                                  non-Euclidean, and of calculus and analysis will be                             developed, with special consideration to the contributions                      of women and non-Western men and cultures to this evolution.                    Participants may earn 18 graduate credits.                                                                                                                      Each participant will serve as mathematical mentor to a                         mathematics teacher and an administrator in her/his school,                     and staff/peer site visits during each school year will                         stimulate a dialogue among mentor and mentees concerning the                    mathematics curriculum and the use of computers in teaching                     mathematics. Thus an additional 48 second-wave colleagues                       will be brought into the program.  In all, 72 teachers and                      administrators will be enhanced.  A Journal of Curriculum                       Units prepared by participants will be distributed to                           participating schools and others for a possible third-wave                      enhancement.  Fairfield University and local business                           cost-sharing will account for 13% of the NSF budget.                                                                                                            Seeing the development of mathematics from an historical                        perspective and knowing the great contributions of women and                    non- Western men and cultures to this development is a key                      component to scientific literacy.  This project may serve as                    a model enhancement program for promoting this component.",
