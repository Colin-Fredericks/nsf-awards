 "awd_abstract_narration": "Image understanding, how the visual system determines what and                  where objects are just by looking, is one of science's greatest                 mysteries.  Despite its seeming effortlessness, it is a problem                 because the image input to the eye is locally ambiguous, i.e., in               any patch of a natural image, there is rarely an unequivocal cue                to shape, surface material, or lighting.  Somehow, the visual                   system makes its best bet as to what is out there from the noisy                pattern of intensities that make up the image, and this visual                  perception in a complex natural environment is rarely wrong.  The               mystery is exactly how the human visual system solves the problem               of ambiguity by exploiting the regularity or statistical                        structure in the eye's image and its visual world.                                                                                                              This research will model regularities in images and object                      properties and measure how well human observers make use of their               implicit statistical knowledge of these regularities.  Whenever                 the statistical information available for a visual task can be                  made explicit and quantified, it is possible to model an \"ideal\"                observer, one that makes optimal use of this information.  A                    direct comparison of human and ideal performance provides a                     measure of statistical efficiency for a visual task.   This                     research will study efficiency in four problems of image                        understanding:  1) Nearby points in natural images often have                   similar intensities, that is, brightnesses are correlated.  This                research will measure the efficiency with which human vision is                 tuned to the intensity correlations in natural images and relate                this to known image encoding processes in visual cortex.  2) Many               objects have some form of symmetry in 3D, but this symmetry gets                distorted when the image is formed in 2D.  In principle, symmetry               can be used to see how objects are slanted in space and to infer                object parts that are occluded.  This research will show what                   forms of symmetry are detected most efficiently and how they may                be used.  3) Nearby objects often cast shadows on each other.                   Experiments will show whether depth from cast shadow information                is used by human vision to infer shape and how it interacts with                other cues to depth, such as motion.  4) Object recognition is                  formally difficult because of uncertain illumination and                        viewpoint.  The research will measure efficiency for the                        classification of 3D objects from 2D images.                                                                                                                    Understanding vision has become a key problem in brain and                      cognitive science.  The problem of image understanding is not                   only important to our understanding of how we acquire knowledge                 of the world, but it is formally hard, resisting the best efforts               of computer scientists to produce a machine that can recognize                  objects in natural images.  Progress in this quest can inform                   research into brain mechanisms as well as computer vision.",
