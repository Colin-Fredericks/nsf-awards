 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 Field Museum of Natural History for the renovation and repair of                paleontological facilities housed in the Department of Geology.                 This building was constructed more than 25 years ago and has not                been renovated since 1975.  The ARFMP grant of $375,000 and                     $420,495 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to                modernize these research and research training facilities and will              permit the accommodation of multiple users.  This project will                  address the need to improve the current research infrastructure in              terms of health and safety as well as of the quality and range of               research that can be conducted by modernizing the heating,                      ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), electrical, and plumbing              systems; constructing new workbenches; and moving the Geomagnetics              Laboratory and Image Analysis Laboratory into renovated, larger,                dedicated rooms.                                                                                                                                                This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of                            paleontological research and for the training of quality                        undergraduate and graduate students not only from the United                    States but also from many other countries.  Students trained in                 these laboratories, with access to these outstanding                            paleontological collections, can benefit from research                          opportunities not available at the neighboring universities with                which they have a collaborative relationship, namely, the                       University of Chicago, the University of Illinois-Chicago, and                  Northwestern University.  The studies of students at the Field                  Museum will complement the programs and facilities at these                     collaborating institutions.",
