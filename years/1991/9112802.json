 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to establish the feasibility of                     using flow and stopped-flow NMR spectroscopy to study rapid                     (less than one second half-life) organometallic reactions. The                  combination of NMR spectroscopy, the most powerful method for                   characterizing organometallic species in solution, with rapid                   mixing techniques may provide a valuable probe of the                           structures and kinetics of important, previously unobservable                   intermediates in element-H activation, olefin insertion, and                    other important organometallic reactions.  Three specific                       systems from ongoing research that will be studied are: 1) E-H                  activation (E = C, B, H) reactions of dinuclear tantalum                        complexes, 2) CO and RNC insertion reactions of                                 cyclopentadienyl tantalum complexes, and 3) olefin and                          acetylene insertion reactions of electrophilic zirconium                        complexes.  The results may yield new mechanistic insights to                   these specific reactions, and will provide the basis for more                   general application of these NMR techniques in organometallic                   chemistry.                                                                      %%%                                                                             With this Grant for Exploratory Research from the Inorganic,                    Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry                       Division, Dr. Louis Messerle and Dr. Richard F. Jordan of the                   University of Iowa will endeavor to establish the feasibility                   of using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for the                  study of rapid organometallic reactions that are complete                       within a few seconds.  This technique should enable the                         observation of unstable reaction intermediates and                              shouldsubstantially extend our understanding of the mechanisms                  of these important reactions.",
