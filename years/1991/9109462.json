 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobility endonucleases are known to promote gene conversion events              in a broad range of organisms including yeast, the T-even                       bacteriophages T2, T4 and T6, the acellular slime mold Physarum                 polycephalum and the green algae Chlamydomonas.  They present a                 minimum of two new classes of DNA-cleavage proteins based on                    analysis of their complex recognition sites and their amino acid                sequences.  Their role in intra-species gene conversion events has              already been established, while their potential involvement in                  horizontal gene transfer and in mitochondrially related fungal                  senescence is under investigation.  The objective of this research              planning grant is to first establish a working system of genetic                and molecular techniques and assays to study the intron-encoded                 mitochondrial endonucleases in Podospora anserina, and to initiate              the proposed study with a specific endonuclease candidate.  These               preliminary efforts will provide the basis for additional studies               that will 1) address the frequency of mobility endonucleases within             the mitochondria of Podospora, 2) characterize selected                         endonucleases in regard to their substrate requirements and                     specificity, 3) study the expression and regulation of these                    proteins and their function in the mitochondria, 4) develop                     techniques to look at the possible acquisition of introns and their             mobility endonucleases via horizontal transfer, and 5) assess their             possible role in senescence- a curious aging process that Podospora             exhibit during culture.",
