 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior research has found testosterone related to individual                     differences in aggression, dominance, and criminal violence.                    This research will gather detailed information on testosterone                  and antisocial behavior in delinquent and normal populations.  It               will also test a biosocial model that predicts antisocial                       behavior as a joint function of high testosterone and low social                control.  Antisocial behavior ranges in severity from unfriendly                facial expressions to unstable personal relationships to criminal               violence.  All these behaviors are correlated with testosterone,                but the correlations are low, and large numbers of subjects are                 needed to have enough statistical power to determine their exact                size.  Other factors are needed to explain why high testosterone                individuals are not always violent. The model proposed here                     treats social control forces, embodied in attachment to family                  and community, as restraining the more violent effects of                       testosterone.  Most high testosterone individuals engage in mild                antisocial behavior, especially when frustrated or challenged,                  but are violent only when social controls are weak.  The                        testosterone-violence correlation should be strongest when social               control is weakest, as when subjects do not identify with family                and community or when they are young, mentally incompetent, or                  under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  The research will                     employ salivary testosterone measurements and behavioral                        observations of prison inmates, college students, military                      veterans, children, and alcoholics.                                                                                                                             The findings will help to specify exactly what antisocial                       behaviors are related to testosterone, how strong the                           relationship is, and what other factors serve to increase or                    decrease the size of the relationship.",
