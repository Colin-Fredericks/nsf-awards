 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research deals with investigating the dynamic                      characteristics and response of truss structures during progressive             collapse initiated by a sudden failure of a member of a portion of              the structures.  In particular, it aims at studying the following:              i) changes in characteristics of the structure (e.g., natural                   frequencies and mode shapes) as the collapse of the structure                   progresses, ii) response of the structure (e.g., displacements,                 stresses, etc.) during the collapse, and iii) vibration                         transmission through the structure.  The sudden rupture or failure              of members during the collapse of the structure will be adequately              represented by initial conditions, and then appropriate analytical              and numerical techniques will be employed/developed to solve the                dynamic problem.  Results from this study are expected to                       contribute to understand (i) the extent or role of dynamic effects              due to sudden failure of members on total collapsing of a truss-                like structure, (ii) the probable path along which the collapse                 progresses, (iii) the probable modes of member failures in the                  process, and (iv) ways to prevent or minimize any potential                     collapsing if the structure.  The proposed investigation should be              useful in practical applications of design of truss-like                        structures, and in general, to fundamental research on \"progressive             collapse\" of structures on earth as well as in space.",
