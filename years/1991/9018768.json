 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research program is to understand the mechanism                 for electron transfer reactions in biological systems.  The                     work is focussed on electron tunneling pathways in proteins,                    i.e., how the protein environment mediates the electron                         transfer reaction.  The work is divided into three categories:                                                                                                  1)  Tunneling Pathways in Proteins - Searches for tunneling                     pathways in native and modified will be performed.  Dr. Onuchic                 will try to understand how details of the protein structure                     define a tunneling pathway.  New theoretical techniques will                    be developed to understand inference effects in individual                      pathways as well as between the pathways.                                                                                                                       2)  Dynamical Modulation of the Tunneling Maxtrix Element - A                   tunneling pathway is composed of covalent bonds, through space                  contacts, and hydrogen bonds.  These though space contacts may                  be flexible, and their motion may modulate the tunneling matrix                 element.  Dr. Onuchic proposed to investigate how this motion                   introduces a temperature dependence to the tunneling matrix                     element.                                                                                                                                                        3)  Model Improvement and New Theoretical Aspects - New                         theoretical calculations will be performed to improve the                       parameters used in the model and to understand the importance                   of multi-electron effects on tunneling pathways.",
