 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synthesis of a new kind of composite materials will be carried              out that has a more highly ordered microstructure than any known                polymer composites.  The composites will consist of monodisperse                colloidal silica spheres distributed as crystalline arrays in                   amorphous polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate) and Poly(ethyl             acrylate).  Crystal-like order will make them highly selective                  filters of visible and infrared light that can be tuned by                      variation of the particle density to reject any wavelength by Bragg             scattering.  The composites will be prepared by sol-gel synthesis               of monodisperse 100 nm diameter silica particles, modification of               the silica surface to make it compatible with monomer, formation of             colloidal crystals of silica in monomer spontaneously or by shear               forces, and polymerization of the monomer.  The modified silica                 particles and the composites will be analyzed by solid state C-13               and Si-29 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  The preparation             and chemical characterization of the colloidal silica and the                   composites will be performed in Professor Ford's research group,                and light scattering and rheological characterization will be                   performed in the laboratory of Professor Bruce J. Ackerson of the               Department of Physics.  The effects of ordering the dispersed                   particles in a composite on its mechanical properties are                       fundamentally important to understand, but presently unknown.                   Glassy and elastomeric polymer composites having a wide variation               of particle density and particle size of the silica will be                     provided to Professor James E. Mark of the University of Cincinnati             for investigation of their mechanical properties.",
