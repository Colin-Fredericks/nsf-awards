 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project are to identify and quantify                      chemical reaction products when chlorine is used to                             disinfect wastewater treatment plant effluents.  Special                        emphasis in this project is on reactions between                                nitrogenous organic compounds such as the amino acids and                       peptides in the effluents with chlorine.  Spectral                              techniques are planned to be used for identification of                         the chlorination products, in the process of                                    characterizing their stability and to determine how                             conventional methods of analysis respond to the presence                        of these compounds.                                                                                                                                             Chlorination is relied on heavily in the United States for                      disinfection of effluents prior to their placement in                           environmental waters.  Chlorine is known to react with                          organic compounds to form products many of which have not                       been fully characterized with respect to their                                  environmental significance for downstream water users.                          Results of this project are expected to provide the basis                       for any changes that may be necessary in engineering                            design and use of chlorination to avoid or eliminate                            environmental problems associated with use of this                              process.",
