 "awd_abstract_narration": "The expression of a very large number of genes (mostly glycolytic               genes or translational component genes) that influence the growth               rate of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is influenced                in turn by the action of only a few regulatory proteins.  In a                  recent publication we presented evidence that two of these                      regulatory proteins, TUF and GCR, activate transcription                        interdependently.  Our data suggested that GCR is an absolute                   requirement for activation by a single, isolated TUF binding site               (UASrpg element).  Here we propose to test the reciprocal idea-                 that UASrpg is an absolute requirement for activation by GCR.  We               will try to disprove the idea that GCR-dependent transcriptional                activation occurs only through UASrpg, and test for DNA binding                 by the GCR protein.  The successful completion of this research                 will contribute to our understanding of GCR function, and form                  the basis for further investigation of the complex roles of TUF,                how those roles are balanced in vivo, and the means by which                    growth rate is controlled in yeast cells.  Yeast cells respond to               changes in their environment (e.g., availability of nutrients) by               changing their rate of growth and division.  These changes                      involve the complex coordination of the action of many different                genes in the cell.  The mechanism of this coordination is poorly                understood, and this is a proposal to study one aspect of this                  process.",
