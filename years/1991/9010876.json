 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. McMillan will study the behavior of stellar dynamical systems               using new computational techniques and capabilities.  In particular             he will perform numerical studies of two separate, but closely                  related, problems involving the dynamics of self-gravitating                    systems.  The first entails the extension of existing integration               techniques into qualitatively new domains, via the incorporation                of new force evaluation methods into established integration codes.             The second involves a detailed investigation of the celebrated                  three-body problem, concentrating on the structure of its parameter             space for scattering encounters, and on the stability of so called              hierarchical triples.  The results of this work will be: (i) the                development of a new stellar dynamical integration code that will               permit a qualitatively new degree of realism to be introduced into              star cluster simulations; (ii) a significant improvement in our                 understanding of the microphysical processes that drive the                     evolution, and determine the appearance of star clusters; and (iii)             important new additions to the arsenal of numerical techniques that             will enable us to fully utilize the capabilities of the next                    generation of super and parallel computers.  Of particular interest             is the application of a new massively parallel computer in star                 cluster simulations and comparison of its suitability for these                 computations with that of more traditional supercomputers.",
