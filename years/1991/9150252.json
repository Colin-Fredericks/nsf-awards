 "awd_abstract_narration": "Illinois State University will conduct a three-year program                     to enhance 56 mathematics teachers of grades 4 through 8.                       Each teacher will attend a four-week summer institute and                       six half-day academic year seminars each year and will be                       given released time to meet with project staff and to mentor                    preservice teachers and their peers.   The project                              emphasizes \"LINCS\" between research and instruction,                            elementary and high school mathematics, self-improvement in                     mathematics instruction and building mathematical                               leadership, and inservice and preservice teachers.                              Approximately 60 preservice teachers will be mentored by the                    participants.  Approximately 100 second-wave teachers will                      also be enhanced through the project, and the local school                      districts have pledged to support further inservicing of                        teachers after the NSF funding terminates.  In all, 60                          preservice and 150 inservices teachers will be effected by                      this project.                                                                                                                                                   Major mathematical topics include the integration of                            technology into mathematics teaching and learning; problem                      solving in the content areas; the teaching and learning of                      prealgebra/algebra concepts and skills; probability,                            statistics and graphing; geometry and measurement; and                          developing number sense and proportional reasoning.                             Eighteen graduate credits may be earned and applied toward a                    Master of Arts degree.  Illinois State University and school                    district cost-sharing accounts for 25% of the NSF budget.                                                                                                       This inservice program which LINCS with a current NSF funded                    preservice program could become a model for Teacher                             Preparation Centers.",
