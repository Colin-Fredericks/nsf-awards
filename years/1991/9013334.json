The purpose of NISEE is                                   to disseminate information on earthquake                                        engineering and allied fields to practicing                                     engineers and related professionals, academic                                   researchers, government agencies and the                                        general public.  The NISEE program at the                                       Earthquake Engineering Research Center,                                         University of California, Berkeley, includes                                    the EERC Library, Earthquake Engineering                                        Abstracts and Computer Applications.  During                                    the last two year grant cycle, the EERC                                         Library acquisitions and public service                                         transactions continued to increase.                                             Earthquake Engineering Abstracts completed                                      the conversion of its software to an in-house                                   publication system.  The NISEE database was                                     made available to users.  Computer                                              Applications continued its distribution of                                      microcomputer and mainframe computer software                                   at the same level as recent years.  The                                         program provides a central collection point                                     for reports on NSF and other sponsored                                          research as well as other developments in                                       earthquake engineering.                                                                                                                                         NISEE will continue to take advantage of new                                    information handling technology to increase                                     the efficiency of current operations, to                                        broaden the spectrum of services provided and                                   to expand the audience served.  The Abstract                                    Journal and NISEE database will continue to                                     expand their audience and bring the Abstract                                    Journal to a current publication schedule.                                      The EERC Library will begin to convert                                          existing manual records into machine-readable                                   form.  Computer Applications will expand                                        capabilities for software which runs on a 386                                   class machine.                                                                                                                                                  This branch of NISEE complements the activity                                   of a second branch at the California                                            Institute of Technology.",
