 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Florida A & M University for the repair and renovation of Jones                 Hall which houses that institution's research and research                      training activities in biology, chemistry, and physics.  This                   building was constructed in 1940 and last renovated in 1974.  The               ARFMP grant of $600,000 and $771,320 provided by the grantee as                 cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve             the current research infrastructure by upgrading existing                       laboratories so that they can accommodate research in molecular                 genetics, ecology, biochemistry, superconductivity, and                         computational physics.  A major focus of the renovation will be on              replacing the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)                 system so as to eliminate the risk of damage to major instruments               such as the electron microscope, spectrometers, x-ray                           diffractometers, and computers.                                                                                                                                 This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                   graduate students.  The proposed renovations will be beneficial to              the training of a significant number of minority scientists at a                rapidly growing institution with an high enrollment of Black                    students.  Florida A & M's strong graduate feeder program which                 places baccalaureates of the University in a select number of                   major graduate institutions throughout the nation contributes both              to the nation's manpower needs and to its science capabilities.",
