 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves production of a book summarizing                     information on the biology of the 178 species of amphibians and                 reptiles occurring in the Yucatan Peninsula (defined to include                 all of the Mexican states of Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo,               together with northern Chiapas, eastern Tabasco, the Guatemalan                 Department of El Peten, and the Republic of Belize).  The book will             permit biologists and educated lay persons (including those species             of amphibian or reptile in the Peninsula, to know its geographical              distribution at a glance, and to understand its ecology, behavior,              food habits, and reproductive biology.                                               Because the Yucatan Peninsula is experiencing rapid                        deforestation due to lumbering activities, and to the explosive                 buildup of tourist facilities along the east coast, remaining                   wilderness areas are under ever-increasing pressure, and important              decisions concerning the preservation of natural areas must be, and             are being, made.  The book will provide, for an important element               of the vertebrate fauna, the critical information necessary to make             informed decisions concerning land management, and conservation                 policy in this large (240,000 sq. km.) portion of the New World                 lowland tropics.",
