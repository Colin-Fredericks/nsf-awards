 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on pre-choice stages of decision making,                  especially  on the generation of alternatives.  Unfortunately there             are few theories with non-choice aspects of decision making.  While             there is some empirical work, it tends to be quite fragment                     to the lack of a general conceptual framework.  Much of the                     attention devoted to these topics has been focused on promoting                 techniques for improving one's creativity, however, such techniques             are rarely tested.  While the investigators do not have a unifying              theory, they do have  the structure provided by an integrative                  computer program that includes a variety of alternative generation              techniques.  They will extend their development of this computer                program which is based on a conceptual approach ranging from highly             structured reasoning to very unstructured thinking.  The program                serves as a means for exploring the relative effectiveness of                   various techniques and their underlying themes.  The  proposed                  tests will include multiple types of problems, problem solving                  durations of up to 3 months, and subjects who face the challenge                of solving problems creatively in their professional lives. As wel              as contributing to empirical knowledge, the results may help to                 advance theory.",
