 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many natural communities show nested subset patterns of                    species composition, in which small communities contain subsets                 of the species found in richer ones.  A broad comparative survey                of natural communities will be used to determine the generality                 of this nonrandom pattern and to identify the biotic and abiotic                factors that produce it.  The survey will include terrestrial and               aquatic, temperate and tropical, plant and animal, and vertebrate               and invertebrate systems.  Several techniques for analyzing this                type of community structure--one established by the PI and the                  others now in development by collaborating scientists--will be                  employed.  Two of these techniques are based on Monte Carlo                     simulations, while the third involves explicit mathematical                     solutions.  Funds are requested for:  a personal computer and                   graduate assistant (0.5 year FTE) to conduct the analyses, and                  travel funds to enable the PI and three collaborators to meet at                the beginning and conclusion of the project to \"brainstorm\"                     techniques, problems, and applications of the nested subset                     pattern.  The breadth of the survey, the variety of analyses, and               the different backgrounds of the PI and collaborators (spanning                 systematics, paleontology, soil ecology, and cybernetics) promise               new, robust perspectives on the ecological importance of nested                 subset patterns.",
