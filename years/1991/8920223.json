 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Chicago in collaboration with Princeton                     University, AT&T Bell Laboratories and other institutions, will                 establish a Science and Technology Center for Astrophysical                     Research in Antarctica.  The Center will be directed by Professor               D. A. Harper.  Infrared and submillimeter astronomy have the                    potential for unlocking some of the major questions concerning the              formation of the Universe, including inhomogeneities in the cosmic              microwave background radiation, the processes by which stars form               from interstellar gas, the formation of planets, the observation                of primeval galaxies, and the inhomogeneous distribution of matter              and energy in the early Universe.  The goal of the Center is to                 establish an observatory at the South Pole with three major                     instruments designed to probe the far reaches of the Universe at                wavelengths ranging from 2 to 3000 microns.  Three experiments will             be set up as follows:                                                             ASTRO (Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory)              will use a 1.7 meter diameter submillimeter telescope whis is                   already being built to make a survey of the Galactic plane, the                 Galactic Center and the Magellanic Clouds using the emission from               the fine-structure line of carbon at 609 microns and the line of                carbon monoxide at 650 microns.                                                   SPIREX (South Pole Infrared Explorer) will use an existing  60                centimeter diameter near-infrared telescope to explore the                      potential of the South Pole as an infrared site and to make initial             deep 2.4 micron continuum surveys for primeval galaxies and brown               dwarf stars.  This spectral window is also located within a \"hole\"              in the celestial background and may afford the most sensitive view              of light from galaxies forming in the early universe.  At this                  wavelength, a South Pole telescope will be more sensitive than the              Hubble telescope and 200 times more sensitive than a ground-based               telescope at a mid-latitude site.                                                 COBRA (Cosmic Background Radiation Anisotropy) is an instrument               to be built that will search for and map anisotropies in the Cosmic             Background Radiation on angular scales ranging from 15 arcminutes               to 20 degrees at sufficient sensitivity to definitively test                    current theories of the origin of the Universe.                                   The significance of this Center is that it will provide                       facilities to enable measurements at wavelengths that are badly                 hampered by the absorption and emission of the Earth's atmosphere.              Nowhere on Earth are the infrared skies clearer or darker than                  above the Antarctic Plateau mainly due to a lack of water vapor in              the air.  It will overcome the diurnal variations in temperature                that lead to atmospheric noise and wind at higher latitudes,  and               much of the infrared background radiation.  (The decrease in                    environmental temperature from 300K to 210-230 K results in an                  enormous decrease in background radiation.) The elevation of the                Antarctic plateau will significantly reduce the atmospheric path                the light must traverse.  The geographic singularity of a Polar                 site also allows a unique opportunity to reduce systematic errors               in searches for cosmic microwave background anisotropies.  All                  these factors should combine to improve the observing conditions                by a factor of 10 to 100.",
