 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry in the                  subfields of electrochemistry and inorganic synthesis.  Caustic is              produced in the USA to the extent of 36,500T/day, mainly by the                 electrolysis of brine.  The anode product, chlorine, is under                   considerable pressure for environmental reasons.  For example,                  sales are declining to the pulp and paper industry because of                   traces of dioxin formed in paper products.  Also, ozone destroying              carbon compounds like chlorofluorocarbons and methylchloroform are              very likely to be replaced by non-chlorine containing substitutes.              As a result there is considerable interest in new technologies to               produce high purity caustic without chlorine production.                                                                                                        The performance of some novel electrolytic cells for the                        manufacture of sodium hydroxide, without co-production of chlorine,             will be investigated in the Phase I research work.  The cells will              use modern membranes and electrodes materials and will be designed              to convert non-halogen sodium salts to high purity, aqueous sodium              hydroxide by a technology which is both highly energy efficient and             friendly to the environment.  The process should be economically                viable over a range of scales and be particularly suited to the on-             site production of 5 to 40 sodium hydroxide streams free of                     impurities such as chloride ion.",
