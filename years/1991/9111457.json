 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effect of environmental variables on human performance is a                 long-standing concern of physical anthropologists.  The primary                 objective of this research is to analyze the biological and                     behavioral factors that affect the ability of humans to work in a               cold environment.  The proposed research will be carried out in                 northern China as heavy laborers are paid by the unit of work                   accomplished, thus allowing easy quantification of work                         performance.  Additionally, the Director of the Work Physiology                 Department of the Institute of Occupational Medicine is a co-PI                 on this project.  The PIs will use standard and newly developed                 methods to measure the workers and their productivity in the                    laboratory and under field conditions.                                                                                                                          The results will be used to test models of the factors which                    enhance and limit human performance under cold conditions.",
