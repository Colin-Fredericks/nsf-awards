The university has developed the company support to be added               to the Center's industry base.  The research projects approved by               the new consolidated Industry Advisory Board for the University of              Cincinnati are \"Decision Support System for the Design Packing and              Palletizing\", \"Simulation Generator for Material Handling Systems\"              and \"Evaluation and Enhancement of Fresh Fruit Material Handling,               Transport, and Storage.\"                                                             A minority woman undergraduate is augmenting the Center's                  research program by studying \"Palletizing Simulation.\"                               The researchers are recognized experts in their fields and                 have the capability and facilities to participate in the new merged             Center.                                                                              The Program Manager recommends the University of Cincinnati                be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing                 grant.  An Additional $3998 is recommended from the Women,                      Minorities, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program.                    Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                   and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review             the progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the               following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                     interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to                  which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                  robust research program is developing.  If the review is                        satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support of the                next period of this continuing grant.",
