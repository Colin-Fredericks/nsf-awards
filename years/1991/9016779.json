 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Marcos Machado, University of Alabama in Huntsville, and Dr.                    Brigitte Schmeider, Observatory of Meudon, Paris, France.                       The objective of the project is to investigate electric                         currents in complex active regions and their relation to solar                  flare and prominences.                                                                                                                                          It is widely accepted that solar flares are due to the                          release of energy stored in stressed, current carrying                          magnetic fields.  Over the past few years, it has also become                   clear that complex field configuration, indicating the                          possible interaction between impacted magnetic bipoles, are                     important to the trigger of flares, as well as the formation                    of prominences and their eruption.  Field complexity and                        particularly energy storage are not yet completely understood                   within the context of flare production, but are thought to be                   linked to converging and shearing motions observed at                           photospheric levels and above.  This project will focus on                      the detection of current buildup, using data from the                           Marshall Space Flight Center and Meudon Observatory, as well                    as proxy indicators of field line connection in the chromo-                     sphere and coronal levels.  The investigators will emphasize                    the link between current buildup and the velocity field,                        exploiting the combined capabilities of US and French                           instruments.  In order to obtain this goal, the observational                   studies will be linked with theoretical field calculations                      under various field conditions to infer the topology of the                     coronal field and its response to the current buildup.",
