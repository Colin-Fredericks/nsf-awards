 "awd_abstract_narration": "The I/UCR Center for Hazardous Substance Management (HSMRC)                at the New Jersey Institute of Technology plans to form an Asian                Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Partnership for Science and                 Engineering with one or more colleges/universities in Indonesia.                One of these institutions will serve as the lead institution of an              academic consortium in Indonesia which will participate in the                  partnership.  The consortium concept offers the opportunity to                  access a broader range of expertise than that which can be offered              by a single university to address hazardous waste management                    issues.  The academic consortium in Indonesia will serve as a                   nucleus for the formation of an Industry/University Cooperative                 Research Center which will carry out at the academic institutions,              a research program in the area of waste management of value and                 interest to the industrial participants in the cooperative research             center.  Faculty and students from Indonesia will participate in                educational and research programs at the HSMRC; HSMRC faculty will              participate in the Indonesian institutions' research activities;                and there will be possibilities for development of interactive                  economic and business endeavors by the corporate membership of the              two linked Cooperative Research Centers in Indonesia and in the                 U.S.  This Center, once established, will train personnel to:  a)               address the waste management concerns of Indonesia's industry and               provide solutions compatible with local requirements and conditions             and b) contribute to the development of an infrastructure that will             lead to sustainable development of Indonesia's economy.  The I/UCRC             concept is appropriate to address the environmental concerns of                 Indonesia's industry.  The academic industrial cooperative effort               allows academia to recognize industry's problems and develop                    strategies to best address these problems with solutions that can               be implemented by industry.  This award will be for $100,000 for                24 months.",
