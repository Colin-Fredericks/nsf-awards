 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to teach microcomputer-based laboratory               instrumentation and data analysis techniques to civil engineering               undergraduates.  This includes the selection of the type and                    characteristics of instrumentation, and the use of statistical                  data analysis methods.  The major instruments to be utilized are                measurement devices such as LVDT's, a pressure transducer,  an                  extensometer, signal conditioners, an analog-to-digital                         converter, an IBM 286 computer with hard drive, a plotter,                      printer and associated software.  The applications of the                       equipment will occur in a required junior level undergraduate                   civil engineering course in construction materials.  The students               will be involved in monitoring load and deformation                             electronically, observing real time date display, using the                     microcomputer to manipulate and analyze the data, and to produce                hardcopy reports and plots.  The project is significant because                 it will familiarize civil engineering students with modern                      electronic microcomputer-based instrumentation and                              microcomputers.  This instructional block is a logical extension                of the sophomore level Introduction to Computational Techniques                 for Civil Engineering Course where students are introduced to                   various software tools and numerical analysis techniques.  In                   this way the student will acquired both software and hardware                   computer skills necessary in today's civil engineering                          profession.  Further, this equipment furthers to stated                         departmental goal of \"replacing obsolete equipment with state-of-               the-art electronic date acquisition systems...\u0131and! to stress                   communication skills, computer skills and statistical skills.\"",
