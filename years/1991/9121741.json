 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project partially supports the work of a task force of                the American Mathematical Society to study the current employment               opportunities for new doctorates in the U.S.  Long term demographic             studies by the National Science Foundation indicate potential                   shortfalls by the end of this decade in our nation's science                    personnel base.  One the other hand, in 1990 declines in the number             of jobs available and increases in the number of applicants were                noted in the mathematical sciences community.  Follow-up surveys                indicated disturbing signs pointing to a shortage of employment                 opportunities in the short term.                                                     This project supports a task force of the American                         Mathematical society to assess the current situation, make                      recommendations on ways to mitigate what may be a short-term supply             and demand imbalance in the academic employment market, develop                 long-term strategies to reduce some of the current inefficiencies               in the employment-seeking process, and report their finding to the              mathematical sciences community.  The project is timely and                     important for the vitality of the U.S. mathematical sciences                    personnel base.  The results will be made available to the                      scientific community, the professional societies, and interested                government agencies.  In the latter case, the results may help in               developing appropriate strategies for the support of postdoctoral               researchers.",
