These activities are                      envisioned as the step in a program of sustained interaction                    between scientists in the US and the USSR in the general area of                nonlinear studies.  These efforts will involve both theoretical                 and experimental scientists with an emphasis on inclusion of new                researchers.                                                                         The problem of turbulence is one of the most challenging in                the interface between physics and mathematics.  It is a                         fundamental problem not only for hydrodynamics but for plasma                   physics, astrophysics and nonlinear optics.  It is now realized                 that many different types of turbulence have the same                           characteristic feature - the nucleation, formation and                          dissipation of special singular coherent structures. These are                  related to singularities of the solutions of the governing                      partial differential equations and are responsible for two key                  processes in turbulence - the production of small-scale motion                  and the dissipation of energy.  These areas will be explored in                 an extended workshop and a conference under the auspices of the                 US-USSR Cooperative Science Program.",
