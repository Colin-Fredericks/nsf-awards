 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is widespread interest within the international scientific                community in the mapping and eventual sequencing of the nuclear                 genome of Arabidopsis thaliana.  Sufficient progress has been                   made in isolating specific genes, in the construction of an                     overlapping series of genomic clones, and in the identification                 of a saturating set of RFLPs, that we should now consider the                   organization of the data that can be expected to flow from this                 effort.                                                                                                                                                         Significant efforts in the mapping and partial sequencing of                    other plants.  Part of the interest in Arabidopsis is in the                    expectation that fundamental discoveries made with this organism                will be applicable to other species, especially those of                        commercial significance.  In addition to establishing a database                for the Arabidopsis genome, it is also important, therefore, to                 establish a system in which molecular information obtained among                a variety of plants can be readily compared.  An obstacle to such               comparisons is the disparity in systems of notations for similar                genes cloned from different plants.                                                                                                                             To assist in meeting these needs, the present project will:                                                                                                     Assess the requirement for representation, storage and                          access of data suitable for the mapping and sequencing of                       Arabidopsis.                                                                                                                                                    Assess the requirement for representation, storage and                          access of data suitable for the interchange of molecular                        information between Arabidopsis research and that on other                      higher plants.                                                                                                                                                  Organize a commission for developing a common notation for                      plant genes.                                                                                                                                                    Collate information on current projects on the mapping and                      sequencing of Arabidopsis and other plant genomes throughout                    the world.  The data would be circulated among interested                       agencies, with summaries published in the Plant Molecular                       Biology Reporter.",
