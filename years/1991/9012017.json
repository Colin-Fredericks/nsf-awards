 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our contemporary world has been radically reshaped by revolutions               which occurred in the late 18th century:  the American Revolution               which gave rise to what would become the most powerful democracy                in the history of the world, the French Revolution which overthrew              the traditional order not only in France but in all of Europe, and,             more surprisingly, the Chemical Revolution initiated by Antoine                 Lavoisier.  Despite the fact that the latter two were intimately                linked, no study has been made showing these links.  This is the                project which Professor Donovan is undertaking.                                                                                                                 Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) is remembered as the central figure               in the 18th century Chemical Revolution and as the most famous                  scientist to be executed in the Terror of the French Revolution.                Understandably, but unfortunately, Lavoisier's importance in the                history of science has had the effect of isolating him from the                 history of his era, the result being that his science is usually                studied without reference to his many administrative activities.                The immediate goal of this project is to prepare a biography of                 Lavoisier, one that will describe his science and his many                      administrative undertakings as closely related efforts to realize               a comprehensive program of reform.  The larger goal is to                       demonstrate that in Lavoisier's case, and by implication in other               cases in the 18th century, the pursuit of science was shaped by a               lively awareness of political and social issues and that this                   attention to larger contextual concerns had profound consequences               for the development of both science and society.",
