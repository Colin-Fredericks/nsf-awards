 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry of the atmosphere is undergoing significant                       changes, not only due to natural causes, but also due to human                  activities.  The emissions of pollutants by human activities have               caused significant increases in the concentration of several                    trace gases.  This inadvertent experiment is predicted to have                  profound effects on air-chemistry and climate.                                                                                                                  The basic goal of the Center for Clouds, Chemistry and Climate                  (C4) is to develop the observational and the modeling base to                   understand and to predict the changing climate and air-chemistry.               Climate-chemistry interactions, the role of clouds in such                      interactions, realistic treatment of clouds in global models and                the role of human activities are the major research themes.                                                                                                     The multi-institutional structure of the center involving                       universities, European institutions, federal labs and industries                will facilitate unprecedented cross-fertilization between groups                from diverse disciplines and accelerate the progress of research                in these institutions.  The proposed research should advance our                knowledge of how micro-and macroscales interact and advance the                 treatment of clouds in global models.  These fundamental advances               should lead to improved predictions of the human impacts on the                 environment and to a better understanding of regional weather and               climate phenomena, including global climate change by greenhouse                gas warming.  The utility and relevance of the research is very                 high.  As indicated by the participation of industry, there is                  immediate technological relevance of experimental methods (data                 handling and image processing) developed for this project.                                                                                                      The role of clouds is the fundamental unifying theme of the                     center which brings together scientists from several                            institutions in the U.S. and Europe who are involved in the study               of chemistry, microphysics, radiation, nonlinear dynamics,                      weather and climate.                                                                                                                                            Important regional scale climate changes are associated with                    clouds since they govern the rate of precipitation, sunlight, UV                irradiance on the biosphere, soil moisture and removal of                       chemicals from the atmosphere.  The radiative effects of clouds                 are so large that just a few percent change in cloudiness is                    sufficient to amplify or ameliorate by a factor of two the                      greenhouse effect of the trace gas increases during the last                    century.  Even the sign of such changes are unknown.  Clouds are                the most poorly treated features in global models.  The uncertain               role of clouds in climate and chemistry is a Gordian knot of                    problems dealing with global changes.                                                                                                                           Clouds form because of microscale and macroscale interactions                   between chemistry, radiation, thermodynamics and dynamics and                   they in turn influence these processes significantly on the                     planetary scale.  In the presence of sunlight, chemical reactions               take place in cloud droplets converting sulfur and nitrogen                     compounds to sulfuric and nitric acids which are scavenged out by               millimeter and larger sized rain drops.  Deep clouds rapidly                    transport short-lived pollutants form the surface layer to the                  upper troposphere thus transferring a local problem into a global               one.                                                                                                                                                            A fuller understanding of cloud phenomena requires a complex                    array of interrelated observations ranging from laboratory                      measurements, aircraft observations of a single cloud to                        satellite observations of the whole globe.  It requires                         microphysical models to understand the interactions within a                    single cloud droplet to global models to unravel cloud feedback                 problems.  It also requires a dedicated group to collaborate                    across disciplinary boundaries.  The proposed research will                     address all of these requirements.                                                                                                                              Large volumes of satellite data will be analyzed to establish the               link between sulfur chemistry and climate and to unravel the role               of cloud radiative-dynamical interactions in major climate events               such as the El-Nino of 1982/83 and the severe summer of 1988.                   Global models of chemistry and climate will be employed to                      understand the chemical coupling between nitrogen oxides,                       methane, other hydrocarbons and ozone in pristine and polluted                  environments.  High resolution radar and satellite observations                 will be used in conjunction with microphysical and regional scale               models to understand how the effects of individual clouds                       aggregate to govern regional scale climate and chemistry.  C4                   scientists will also participate in field measurements to develop               and verify models of chemistry and climate.  Useful results from                the proposed research include:  global distribution of UV                       irradiance on the biosphere; regional distributions of the                      anthropogenic radiative forcing during the last century;                        improved treatment of clouds in global models; and prediction of                regional changes.                                                                                                                                               Summer courses and workshops will be conducted to reach out to                  high school and college science teachers and other students.                    This outreach effort will take advantage of the effective                       educational programs currently in operation in the Chicago area.",
