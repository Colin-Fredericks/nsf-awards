 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding of geographical patterns and processes related               to industrial production has been limited to some extent                        because the focus of economic geographers has been on the                       material production of manufactured goods.  Significant and                     rapidly growing sectors of the economy include industries that                  produce little tangible output, such as information and other                   intangible goods.  Understanding the nature of the industries in                these sectors involves consideration of different economic                      and spatial factors than those associated with traditional                      industries.  This doctoral dissertation project will study the                  production process, product characteristics, and the spatial                    organization of production in the emerging field of knowledge-                  based systems (KBS), which are software systems designed                        specifically to encode and apply extensive and highly detailed                  factual data and techniques, usually of a scientific or technical               nature.  An extensive statistical database of KBS industries,                   surveys, and in-depth interviews will be used to increase                       understandings of the spatial configuration of KBS development.                                                                                                      This project will provide valuable information about                       knowledge-based systems which soon will dominate computer-                      telecommunications industries, and it will add depth to the                     understanding of geographers and political economists about                     processes of industrial development.  This project also will                    provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to               continue to develop independent research skills.",
