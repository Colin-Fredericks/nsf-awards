This study should allow them to                    reconcile water column production and sinking fluxes of the                     major biochemicals (lipids, amino acids, pigments, and                          carbohydrates) with the corresponding sediment deliver,                         accumulation and preservation rates, using well over 100                        individual organic compounds.  Major questions are:  1) What                    are the dynamics of particles in the surface Equatorial Pacific                 as reflected by their organic constituents?  2) What fractions                  of the different biochemicals produced in the surface waters                    reach the deep ocean and are accumulated at the sediment-water                  interface?  3) What are the relative reactivities of different                  organic substances in the underlying sediments?  4) Do                          biochemical distributions differ appreciably with the inorganic                 composition of the various sediment types along the study                       transect?  To address these questions the P.I.:s will sample                    suspended particles by insitu pumping, sinking particles using                  our new swimmer-exclusion traps, and bottom sediments from box                  cores at transect and time-series stations in coordination                      sampling with other EQPAC investigators.",
