 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to examine at the molecular                   level the mechanism of assembly of viral precursors into an                     infectious virus particle.  A common mechanism for DNA                          packaging by the phage viruses has been proposed and consists                   of 1) binding of an enzyme called terminase to concatemeric                     (immature) viral DNA, 2) binding of this complex to a pre-                      formed capsid, 3) unidirectional of DNA into the capsid in an                   ATP-dependent reaction and4) nicking of the duplex and strand                   separation such that a single (mature) genome is packaged.                      Phage terminase is now obtainable in high yields and represents                 an ideal system in which to study viral DNA packaging.  The                     enzyme possesses DNA-dependent ATPase, DNA translocase,                         restriction endonuclease and DNA helicase activities all                        manifest within a heterodimeric protein structure.                              Thermodynamic binding constants for ATP and DNA will be                         determined using equilibrium dialysis, gel-retardation and                      DNase footprinting techniques.  The interactions between enzyme                 and ATP as well as enzyme and viral DNA will be examined using                  photoaffinity labeling techniques.  Covalently modified                         residues will be identified by proteolytic digestion of the                     protein, isolation of the labeled peptide(s) and N-terminal                     amino sequencing analysis.  A complete kinetic analysis of the                  endonuclease and helicase activities will be performed and a                    minimal kinetic mechanism defined using steady state and pre-                   steady state kinetic techniques.  The experiments outlined in                   this proposal will allow a detailed characterization of phage                   terminase and serve as a basis for comparative studies with                     terminases from other phages  Examination of these enzymes may                  reveal evolutionary relationships not only between terminases,                  but also other functionally related enzymes such as ATPases,                    restriction enzymes and helicases.  Moreover, DNA packaging,                    the procaryotic version of chromosomal condensation, may yield                  insight into the basis mechanisms and energetics of cellular                    chromosome manipulation.",
