 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal examines the gap between what how well weather                    forecasters are expected to use additional information and how                  well they actually use it.  The proposal specifically examines how              that gap widens as a function of the amount and complexity of new               information.  The first study examines the effects on judgemental               reliability and validity of automating information acquisition and              information processing.  The second study examines the validity and             reliability of informatyion acquisition as a function of amount of              information.  The third study focusses on the reliability and                   validity of information processing.  The fourth study investigates              the interaction between information acquisition and information                 processing as a function of amount of information.  The results of              this research will contribute to our understanding of expert                    judgement in weather forecasting and other fields.  It should have              practical implications for helping experts make the best use of                 technology that increases the amount of information available to                them.",
