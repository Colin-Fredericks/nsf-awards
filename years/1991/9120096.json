There is a large inventory of older                                             reinforced masonry (URM) buildings                                              located in high seismic regions                                                 throughout the country which were                                               not designed and detailed for                                                   adequate lateral strength and                                                   ductility as per current code                                                   standards.  These buildings pose the                                            greatest life hazard during moderate                                            or severe earthquake, as attested to                                            by damage suffered by many of such                                              buildings during the 1987 Whittier                                              earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta                                             earthquake.  A number of these                                                  buildings are being evaluated and                                               strengthened using several different                                            techniques, steel bracing and being                                             one of the widely used schemes.                                                 However, there has been no                                                      experimental study on the seismic                                               behavior of masonry wall-bracing                                                systems under severe cyclic                                                     deformations and on rational                                                    procedures for their design which                                               will ensure satisfactory performance                                            during a severe earthquake.                                                                                                                                     A joint cooperative research effort                                             is conducted to study the in-plane                                              seismic behavior of masonry (URM)                                               walls strengthened with steel                                                   bracing.  The objectives are to                                                 evaluate, through testing and                                                   analysis, currently used philosophy                                             and design procedures, and to                                                   develop improved methods for                                                    strengthening existing buildings by                                             using ductile steel bracing systems                                             to enhance their safety during                                                  future earthquakes of severe \"design                                            level\" intensities.  The findings of                                            the proposed study will be useful                                               for formulation of code requirements                                            for evaluation and strengthening of                                             existing URM buildings.",
