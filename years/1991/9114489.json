 "awd_abstract_narration": "Special cases of nonlinear programs with quadratic constraints             that arise in engineering applications are investigated.  These                 applications include refinery blending problems in petrochemical                processes, component placement problems in circuit design, minimax              location problems in industrial engineering, and modular design                 problems in production and manufacturing.  The primary focus is on              the development of a new algorithm for obtaining (approximate)                  global solutions for these problems.  A paramount issue in applying             an algorithm to a given problem is the question of existence of a               solution when the feasible region is not empty.  New conditions                 will be derived for quadratically constrained applications and                  techniques for checking these conditions will be developed.  Two                general approaches will be explored in developing algorithms:                   outer approximation and branch and bound.  Outer approximation                  includes, but is not limited to cutting (plane) methods.  Bounding              will be accomplished by the use of convex envelopes and by                      nonlinear duality theory.                                                            The results that are anticipated from this research effort                 should contribute significantly to the efficient (real time)                    solution of a larger class of quadratically constrained problems                than currently possible.  Many of the ideas and constructions that              will be reported are not well known and have the potential to be                extended to problems beyond the scope of this study and, hence,                 should contribute to a better understanding of the practicality of              solving real instances of nonlinearly                                           constrained optimization problems.",
