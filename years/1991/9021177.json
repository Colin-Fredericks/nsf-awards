Oxytocin is a peptide                hormone that is synthesized in cell bodies localized in the                     hypothalamus and transported to the posterior pituitary, from                   which it is released directly into the general circulation.  This               neuropeptide is critical for parturition, lactation and changes                 in plasma osmotic pressure.  Recently, new functions, beside its                classic role as a posterior pituitary hormone, has been proposed                for oxytocin.  The hypothalamic oxytocinergic system has been                   shown to undergo dramatic structural plasticity in response to                  normal physiological stimuli and to be directly involved in the                 regulation of maternal, sexual and social behaviors.  This                      conference brings together internationally recognized scientists                from diverse disciplines to exchange ideas and provide a                        comprehensive summary of the present state of knowledge in this                 exciting and important field.  The format of this meeting                       provides the atmosphere to foster meaningful interchanges between               an interdisciplinary group of scientists that include                           neuropharmacologist, neuroanatomists and psychobiologist.  The                  outcome of these discussions have the potential to lead to a                    better understanding of the integration between structure and                   function of which oxytocinergic neurons are particularly suitable               for analysis.",
