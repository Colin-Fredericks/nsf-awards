 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses three fundamental problems in machine                    dynamics whose solutions are important in the design of high                    productivity machines in the material processing and computer                   industries.  The three research topics are (1) supercritical speed              rotating plates, (2) vibration of damped, asymmetric, high speed,               rotating circular plates subjected to a stationary slider bearing               system, and (3) vibration and stability of high speed bands (tapes,             fibers, belts, and saws).                                                                                                                                       The  first topic's impact will be in computer disk drives and                   circular sawing machines.  Current systems use subcritical speed                to avoid resonance of vibration waves by low frequency excitations.             Supercritical speed plates are subject to aeroelastic flutter and               thereby limited in their use.  Supercritical speed plates would                 imply gains in productivity, and this research seeks to determine               the maximum operating speed of a rotating plate.                                                                                                                The second problem addresses a class of systems which includes                  computer disk drives, circular sawing rigs, and disk brake rotors.              The plate/slider system can be unstable at subcritical and                      supercritical speed.  This research develops a complete                         understanding of the stability of axisymmetric plate/slider                     systems.                                                                                                                                                        The third research problem addresses the class of systems which                 includes digital memory tapes, drive belts, band saws, tramway                  cables, textiles, paper rolls, and newsprint.  Enhanced                         productivity is possible with higher transport speed, but higher                speed also leads to transverse vibration which can lead to reduced              accuracy and even system failure.  This research provides for                   higher speeds by developing linear vibration control of distributed             axially moving materials through the use of transverse force                    actuators and of tension control.",
