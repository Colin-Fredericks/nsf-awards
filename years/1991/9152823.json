 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing specialized optical analysis                          equipment for use by advanced optics students at the University                 of Rochester Institute of Optics.Optical fabrication technology                 relies upon the unique skills of master opticians for the                       production of specialized optics.  Small, ultra-thin crystal                    windows, glass prisms with sharp edges, aspheric germanium                      lenses or optically-contacted elements are made to sub-micron                   tolerances by these craftsmen, who traditionally have learned                   their techniques in extensive apprentice programs at trade                      schools in Eastern Europe.The hands-on fundamentals of optical                  fabrication are being passed on to undergraduates by two master                 opticians at the University of Rochester in a laboratory course                 initiated by the principal investigator three years ago.                        Projects take students through glass melting, casting,                          annealing, and into hand fabrication of precision lenses,                       flats, and prisms.  Students and their employers find this                      course to be valuable, because it teaches just how costly it                    can be to improperly tolerance optical elements when designing                  products.With the non-contacting surface profiler and phase-                    shifting interferometer acquired through this project, students                 are being trained to use modern instrumentation for studying                    fabrication issues ranging from sub-surface damage to optical                   inhomogeneity created by stirring of the glass melt.  This new                  instrumentation is comparable to that currently found in most                   industrial laboratories and quality-assurance departments.NSF                   grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal                       sources.",
