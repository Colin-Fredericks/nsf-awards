 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine bryozoans are important bottom-dwelling animals,                    especially where there are solid surfaces like shells, rocks or                 seaweed for colonies to attach.  The purpose of this project is to              carry out a survey and species inventory of the little known marine             bryozoan fauna of the northeast coast of the United States.                          Researchers will accomplish this by 1) making new collections              in as many locations as possible between Maine and Virginia, 2)                 analyzing collections made by other scientists working in the area,             and 3) examining material already in museums in the region,                     especially the type specimens, on which any original descriptions               of local species were based, and any still uncataloged specimens                they may have.                                                                       By means of the latest scanning electron microscope (SEM) and              electronic measuring techniques, all species found will be studied              and the findings published.  The result will be an up-to-date                   illustrated guide to the marine bryozoans of the northeastern                   United States.  It will be of great practical use to biologists                 studying the increasingly environmentally stressed northeastern                 coastal zone.  It will be important also to scientists and students             interested in bryozoan evolution, providing a current                           classification and new descriptions, as well as answering questions             about family relationships and geographical distribution.",
