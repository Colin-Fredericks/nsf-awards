 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is developing languages and mechanisms for                        restructuring and merging information from disparate databases,                 and is studying the theoretical foundations of such languages.The               research uses the PI's formally defined ILOG languages, which                   permit the declarative specification of database restructuring.                 Certain technical properties of these languagesprovide a strong                 connection to logic programming.  The research is also developing               extensions to ILOG for data merging; a central problem here                     involves determining when object identifiers (OIDs) in two or                   more distinct databases refer to the same object \"in the world\",                and developing appropriate mechanisms for \"merging\" the OIDs in                 this case.  Specific theoretical questions under study include:                 attempting to characterize when two (restructuring or merging)                  programs are equivalent; exploring algebraic properties of                      programs (e.g., associativity, distributivity);developing                       algorithms for the translation of queries against restructured,                 merged databases; and for incrementally updating such databases                 if they are materialized.  Experimental work will be performed to               test the algorithms and view update methodologiesunder realistic                conditions.  The results obtained by the researchwill provide a                 crucial component for all database applications which involve                   data sharing.",
