 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Exploratorium proposes to conduct a staff development                       program to help 36 museum professionals expand their exhibit                    development capabilities.  Our intent is to conduct a 2 year                    program in which eighteen participants a year will take                         part.  Each year, Eploratorium senior exhibit development                       staff and quest faculty from other science museums, will                        hold a one-week seminar; this will be followed by a four-                       week internship at the Exploratorium.  The year would                           conclude with a week long seminar on the educational and                        programmatic use of exhibits.  A maximum of two persons from                    any single museum would be allowed to participate in the                        program enabling us to serve a minimum of 18 and a maximum                      of 36 museums from around the United States.  Candidates                        would have to demonstrate an appropriate level of                               professional experience and committment. A significant                          aspect of the program is the individual attention the                           Exploratorium will provide by organizing the internships to                     occur in six consecutive sessions, each limited to three                        participants.  A senior exhibit developer will act as a                         mentor/advisor for the participants and help them experience                    the process of turning ideas into variable exhibits.                            Participants will be able to make use of the exhibit staff,                     shop resources and the participating museums would obtain a                     core set nof 20 exhibits; these would be selected from a                        matrix of over 100 possible exhibits.  In this way museums                      would aquire refined and innovative exhibits which would                        best serve their individual pedegogical and technical needs.                    These exhibits would be built by Exploratorium staff with                       the directinvolvement of the program participants.                              Selections would be made during a week-long consultation                        visit with Exploratorium staff.",
