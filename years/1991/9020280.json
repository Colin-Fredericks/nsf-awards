 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to digest different kinds of foods has an                      enormous influence on the kinds of foods chosen by animals, on                  how and when they feed, and on the rates at which they grow and                 reproduce. The influence of digestive studies on ecology and                    behavior, however, has been practically ignored. The application                of digestive physiology has been hampered by a wide gap between                 detailed studies of digestion and absorption at the cellular and                biochemical levels, and the measurement of food assimilation at                 the whole organism level.                                                            The analogy between the digestive systems of animals and                   chemical reactors provides a bridge that links measurements of                  digestive processes at the cellular and whole organism level into               a integrative and predictive framework. Mathematical models based               on chemical engineering principles will be used to generate and                 test productions about the digestive processes of birds feeding                 on nectar and fruit pulp.  Our models also provide predictions                  about the feeding preferences of birds with different                           physiological traits, and thus provide a direct liaison between                 digestive processes and the ecologically relevant process of food               selection.                                                                           The digestive traits of animals are not fixed; within a                    span, they depend on acclimation to different diets. The                        influence of different diets on the digestive processes of birds                with contrasting dietary habits, how changing a diet influences                 the ability to digest and absorb carbohydrates, lipids, and                     proteins, and how dietary changes influence these digestive                     processes at the cellular, organ, and whole organism levels, will               be investigated. Chemical reactor theory will be used to                        integrate our results.                                                               In addition to providing a bridge between digestive                        physiology and ecology and behavior, our research will provide                  information on the digestive capabilities and limitations of                    birds in captivity, and in improving husbandry practices for both               endangered species in zoological parks and animals with economic                value.",
