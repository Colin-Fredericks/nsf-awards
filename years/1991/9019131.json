 "awd_abstract_narration": "Failure to adapt to prolonged isolation and extreme conditions of               polar environments can have adverse consequences for both the                   individual and the organization.  Despite decades of research,                  the identification of social and psychological characteristics                  associated with successful adaptation and performance in these                  settings remains problematic.  Building upon the results of                     preliminary work conducted both in Antarctica and in the Canadian               High Arctic, the proposed study will focus on social and                        psychological characteristics that predict performance and                      adaptation in both polar regions.  Research will be conducted at                McMurdo Station in Antarctica and four Atmospheric Environmental                Service weather stations in the Canadian High Arctic using a                    battery of psychological screening instruments and a standardized               debriefing protocol.  This study will add to our understanding of               the social and psychological sequellae of adaptation and                        adjustment in polar regions contributing to group morale and                    well-being, improved safety, and performance in these regions.                  In addition, the research will explicate fundamental                            interrelationships among environmental stress, coping resources,                personality traits, and performance, and provide a growing data                 base for comparative and cross-cultural studies of adaptation and               performance in polar environments.",
