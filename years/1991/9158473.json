 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year base amount funding of a five-year PYI                   continuing award.  This PYI will continue his research on                       distributed artificial intelligence (AI) with an emphasis on                    building intelligent computing systems for dynamic, multiagent                  applications.  The research uses blackboard systems and other                   integrating architectures that allow an agent's perception,                     reasoning, communication, and motor components to collectively                  control an agent's behavior.  The PI is also pursuing work in                   real-time artificial intelligence.  He is working on developing                 preliminary theories of real-time reasoning that account for both               meeting deadlines and for negotiating to change deadlines.  This                work on techniques for negotiating ties into his additional                     research interest in uncovering the  general principles                         underlying coordination between intelligent agents.  The goal is                to build interdisciplinary theories of coordination, drawing on                 concepts from management science and operations research as well                as AI, and to embody these theories in practical mechanisms for                 coordinating multiple intelligent computing systems.  The near                  term plan is to develop a core of interdisciplinary concepts                    using a hierarchy of behavioral specifications as a common                      representation, with the long-term objective of developing                      fundamental theories of a science of coordination.  The                         researcher is also interested in applying techniques for                        coordinating AI systems to problems in human-human and human-                   computer interactions.",
