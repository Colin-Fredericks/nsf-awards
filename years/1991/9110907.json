 "awd_abstract_narration": "The one-dimensional vectorial Helmholtz equation in                             nonlinear isotropic Kerr media is one of the most                               fundamental equations in nonlinear optics.  By                                  nature, this equation is capable of describing any one-                         dimensional optical field configuration in X(3)                                 materials.  As a result, it plays a central role in a                           number of very important and potentially useful                                 nonlinear interactions, such as that of collinear                               degenerate four-wave mixing and that of optical                                 bistability.  However so far, the nonlinear Helmholtz                           equation in such configurations has been treated                                approximately.  At this stage, it is by no means clear                          that these approximate techniques provide an                                    accurate enough picture (or even the whole picture)                             associated with this problem.  The exact solution of                            this problem is very important, first as a matter of                            principle, then as a way to test already existing                               theories and finally it may lead to new significant                             results.  It is the purpose of this research proposal to                        investigate the exact behavior of Helmholtz equation                            in isotropic nonlinear Kerr media in a comprehensive                            program, that will involve both analytical and                                  computer simulations.                                                                                                                                           Specific goals in this Research Initiation Award are:                           a) to identify integrable cases of this equation using                          Hamiltonian techniques and in turn use them to test                             previously obtained approximate results.  b) to                                 discover totally new phenomena, such as spatial chaos                           in isotropic Kerr media that may have been                                      overlooked by previous approximate procedures.  c)                              to improve our understanding of wave propagation in                             X(3) media, which will in turn benefit other associated                         areas of research.",
