To realize this objective three task have                     been formulated:                                                                                                                                                     1)  to review the literature for analytical methods which                       have      been applied to the determination of metal                            species                                                                                                                                                         2)  to apply existing methods or develop new methods to                         analyze for metal species in samples obtained from a                            controlled combustion environment, and                                                                                                                          3)  to modify or develop and test metal species sampling                             systems                                                                                                                                               To this end, analytical methods using the currently available                   techniques of ion chromatography and X-ray diffraction to                       identify and quantify the metal species found in the gas phase                  of an experimental reactor will be developed, along with a                      sampling system for metal species.                                                                                                                              Future research will determine the effect of combustion                         parameters (e.g. temperature, chemical makeup, and residence                    time) on the metal species formed.  Knowledge of the actual                     species will be utilized to develop an algorithm to predict                     the fate of the metal constituents during rotary-kiln                           incineration.",
