As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                    Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                     Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                 initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                 of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                  properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                 geospace model with predictive capability.                                           The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                             magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                   connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                   ionosphere.  This grant requests support to operate an induction                coil magnetometer at Frobisher Bay, Canada sensitive to magnetic                pulsations  having periods between 1000 sec. and 0.1/sec.                       Pulsations in this frequency range could be an important                        component of the GEM mapping program since they present a                       possible opportunity to sample superthermal and energetic ion                   populations in their generation region",
