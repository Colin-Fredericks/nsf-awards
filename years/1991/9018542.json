 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leukotrienes are biomedically important regulatory compounds                    synthesized from arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase/LTA4 synthase               in mammals.  However, information concerning the structures and                 functions of leukotrienes is almost completely lacking in non-                  mammalian vertebrates.  It is important to examine leukotriene                  synthesis and action in poikilothermic vertebrates, such as                     amphibians because (a) their cell membranes contain other                       polyunsaturated fatty acids which may modulate leukotriene                      synthesis (b) metabolic and physiological processes are affected                by environmental temperature and (c) frog tissues are simpler than              their mammalian counterparts and can serve as less complex model                for leukotriene action.  Previous research by this laboratory has               demonstrated biological effects of leukotrienes on hypotension in               cannulated bullfrogs and in in vitro studies on contractility of                isolated bullfrog heart and lung strips.  This proposal will                    examine 1) regulation of leukotriene synthesis by heart, lung, and              blood vessels 2) involvement of cyclic nucleotides and                          phosphoinositides in the mechanism of leukotriene action on the                 heart, lung, and vascular system and 3) characterization of                     leukotriene binding to amphibian heart and lung membrane receptors              using radioreceptor assays and autoradiography.  The proposed                   research will provide additional insight into the evolution of                  these important regulatory compounds.//",
