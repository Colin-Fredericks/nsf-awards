 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program at the University of Pennsylvania provides nine                    undergraduate students with research opportunities in the broad                 area of Sensor Technologies.  The goal of the effort is to generate             scientific knowledge and to apply this knowledge to sensor                      development.  The REU Site is part of the Summer Undergraduate                  Fellowship in Sensor Technologies (SUNFEST) program of the                      University's Center for Sensor Technologies.  The Center provides               the infrastructure for faculty and students to collaborate,                     exchange ideas, co-supervise students, and share resources.                     Students are selected by a faculty committee based on their                     academic potential, interest in pursuing a research career,                     attitude towards graduate studies, advisors, recommendations,                   membership in under-represented groups, and research opportunities              in the mother institution.  It is anticipated that about half of                the students will come from outside University of Pennsylvania.                 The undergraduate students participate actively in a research                   project of one or more participating faculty.  Special emphasis is              placed on the broader interaction of these SUNFEST fellows with the             graduate students and faculty members associated with the Center.               The projects suggested to the students are chosen for their                     educational value, scientific merit, and the prospects for                      continued involvement after the summer.  Project topics include:                chemical, optical, mechanical, and neural network based sensors;                microdynamical systems, phenomena and micromachining; and sensor                interfacing.  The Center provides an additional $1000 per student               as matching funds towards the student stipend.  The school also                 contributes $500 per student to be used for computing facilities,               in addition to making facilities and laboratory personnel                       available.",
