 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 Marine Biological Laboratory for the renovation and repair of                   Lillie Research Laboratory which contains year-round and summer,                nonclinical, independent research laboratories that house research              and research training activities in cellular, developmental,                    molecular and neurobiological sciences as well as in marine                     ecology.  This building was constructed in several phases beginning             in 1913 and last renovated in 1958.  The ARFMP grant of $575,000                and $726,600 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used               to modernize these research and research training facilities.  This             project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure both in terms of health and safety and of reduced                risk of loss of research data and frozen samples.  The renovation               will provide adequate environmental control in a deleterious marine             climate and an emergency electrical power system, along with an                 upgraded heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system;              and all asbestos will be removed from the building.                                                                                                             This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of pre-college students and teachers as well as                graduate students.  Because of the international and national                   position of the Marine Biological Laboratory, the wider research                community will also benefit from this modernization.",
