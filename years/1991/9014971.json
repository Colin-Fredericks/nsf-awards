 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a joint U.S.-Australia workshop                         \"The Nature of Embryonic Signals Which Influence the                            Maternal Endocrine System; 1-3 July 1991 in Honolulu,                           Hawaii. The U.S. and Australian organizers of the                               workshop are Dr. Fuller Bazer of the University of                              Florida and Dr. Robert J. Fairclough, Animal Research                           Institute, Werribee, Victoria, Australia. The principal                         objective of the workshop is to review published and                            unpublished results of research from 1989-1991 indicating                       major and important breakthroughs in understanding of                           the implantation process of embryos and the nature and                          mode of action of conceptus signals responsible for                             implantation and establishment of pregnancy in several                          mammalian species.  The major discussion will focus on                          early pregnancy factors, including platelet activating                          factor (PAF) and conceptus interferons, their mechanism(s)                      of action, their endocrine control and their effects                            during early pregnancy in both livestock and women.  It                         is anticipated that this knowledge will ultimately lead                         to new methods for reducing embryonic mortality in                              animal agriculture and increasing fertility in both                             livestock and women.  The scope of the meeting will be                          limited to factors affecting establishment of pregnancy                         during the peri-implantation period.  Because of                                significant activities in this area of research by                              scientists in Australia and the United States, the seminar                      will provide a forum for the exchange of published and                          unpublished results, as well as for establishing areas for                      future U.S.-Australian cooperative research.",
