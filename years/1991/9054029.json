 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of individuals to successfully undertake curricula in               science and technology is acutely impacted by the availability of               appropriate assistive technology.  In many cases, neither the                   individual, his/her therapist, or the college counselor is aware                of all the available technology or the sources of funding for that              technology.  This project is designing, developing, and testing a               prototype expert system-based tool for accurately matching                      assistive technology and funding sources with individuals .  The                prototype is based on a unique concept of multidimensional                      taxonomies for disability causes and conditions, life purpose and               needs, and available products.  The prototype system is being                   evaluated in three institutional environments and the results                   assessed.  Based on the results of this study, the prototype system             may be converted to a fully functional product by Meeting the                   Challenge, Inc. and made available to institutions across the                   country thus providing a coherent mechanism for enhancing the                   success potential of many students with disabilities.",
