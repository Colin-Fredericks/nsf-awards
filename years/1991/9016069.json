 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will measure the rates of NH+4 and NO-3                            assimilation, nitrification and nitrogen fixation in the Sargasso               Sea over a seasonal cycle in conjunction with the ongoing Bermuda               Atlantic time series (BATS) study.  These measurements are                      designed to assess the rate of new production, including both                   nitrate uptake by the plankton and nitrogen fixation, and to                    assess the regeneration rates of the inorganic substrates.  Size                fractionation by filtration and cell sorting by flow cytometry                  will be used to identify the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen                 by different components of the plankton community.  Studies of                  the nitrogen cycle in an oligotrophic gyre over a seasonal cycle,               together with other U.S. JGOFS research, will increase our                      understanding of the physical and biological controls on new and                regenerated production.                                                                                                                                         The nitrogen cycling measurements will employ trace metal clean                 precautions during ondeck incubations with 15N.  Recently                       improved analytical techniques for measuring low ambient                        concentrations of NH+4 and NO-3 will be used to monitor nutrient                concentrations during the multiple time point incubations and to                ensure tracer level additions are made.  Care will be taken to                  account for substrate regeneration and to construct an inventory                of the added label.",
