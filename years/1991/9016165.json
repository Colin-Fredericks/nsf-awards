 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators (PI) will conduct research on the                transmission of video signals over fiber optic ATM based networks.              The emphasis in on the impact that video service with its coding,               synchronization and error recovery mechanisms and the ATM network               with its multiplexing/switching, scheduling/ prioritization and                 control schemes will have on each other.  The research will address             coding issues, video/ATM networking interfaces and network control.             They will investigate motion compensation for three-dimensional                 subband coding and transform coding, as a vehicle for temporal data             conversion, error concealment and compression enhancement. They                 will also consider non-separable filter banks used in subband                   coders.  A major portion of the research will be the study of the               interface between the video coder and the network. This will                    include examining the relationship between video services, coding               schemes, and the statistics of the output streams of the  various               variable bit rate codecs.  The research will result in the design               and development of a packetizer/ depacketizer to be used in                     conjunction with the coding schemes. Network control will include               exploring the effect that mechanisms such as prioritization,                    scheduling and flow control will have on video services.",
