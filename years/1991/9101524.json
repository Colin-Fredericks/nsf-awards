 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop concurrency control                algorithms for transactions in distributed database systems which               achieve high throughput and low response time.  Data replication is a           mechanism that has been proposed for this purpose.  Unfortunately, the          requirement that transactions behave serializably                               forces considerable synchronization among replica sites and hence               adversely impacts throughput and response time.                                 This work will consider the tradeoff between serializability and                throughput/response time by allowing bounded violations of the                  database's integrity constraints.  Such violations occur when                   conflicting transactions are not synchronized.  Under these                     circumstances a transaction is ignorant of the effects of some prior            transactions, and so the results it returns and the modifications it            makes to the database are based on incomplete information.  Both the            deviation from serializable behavior and the throughput/response time           are directly related to the extent of ignorance.  Concurrency control           algorithms which bound the extent to which a transaction can be                 ignorant of conflicting transaction will bound the deviation from               serializable behavior.  Since violations of integrity constraints are           not permissible in all applications, the research involves study of             the characteristics of applications in which violations can be                  tolerated.",
