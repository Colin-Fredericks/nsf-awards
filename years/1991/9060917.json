 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed towards establishing the                              feasibility of using wave energy to provide high-pressure                       seawater at remote coastal and island locations.  This has                      potential commercial value because of the many possible                         uses of high-pressure seawater: it can be circulated in                         onshore aquaculture tanks, passed through a reverse                             osmosis membrane to produce fresh water, or passed through                      an impulse turbine to generate electric power.                                                                                                                  The entire project (Phases I through III) is focused on                         the small-scale needs of rural areas in developing                              countries, where even the provision of a few thousand                           liters of fresh water per day of a few kilowatts of power                       would significantly improve basic living conditions and                         facilitate economic growth.  For example, the shoreside                         provision of ice (requiring both fresh water and                                electricity) would enhance the cash-earning power of local                      fisheries.                                                                                                                                                      In order to establish the feasibility of this concept,                          fundamental research is needed on the hydrodynamic                              behavior of the wave energy absorber, which is an inclined                      cylindrical pipe, entirely submerged beneath the sea                            surface, with one end resting on the seafloor.",
