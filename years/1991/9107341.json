 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that                   plant species diversity in young agricultural old-fields is                     maximal at moderately low levels of available soil nitrogen, a                  growth-limiting resource, under conditions of moderate and                      fine-grained disturbance to the plants in the field.  This                      hypothesis will be tested by creating a nitrogen availability                   gradient in the old-field by enhancing availability with nitrogen               fertilizer and by reducing availability by adding sugar to                      microbially immobilize nitrogen.  This approach represents the                  first experimental reduction of nitrogen availability to look for               a peak plant species diversity response.                                             Many studies have shown that nitrogen fertilization of                     natural ecosystems leads to reductions in biological diversity.                 The research should be of interest because it tries to examine                  the lower levels of nitrogen availability which may allow for                   maximal biological diversity.  These results should be of                       interest to land managers trying to conserve existing biological                diversity and restorationists trying to create new species-                     diverse ecosystems.",
