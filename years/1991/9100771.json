 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this program, undergraduate engineering students participate in              research projects in the laboratories of members of the Biomedical              Engineering Department of the Johns Hopkins University.  Opportunities          are available for basic research on biomedical instrumentation, sensors,        prosthetics, biomaterials, biomechanics, neurophysiology, and neural            modeling, cardiovascular physiology and modeling, mathematical modeling,        and membrane and cellular physiology.  Students are recruited from              institutions in the Baltimore-Washington area, including Johns Hopkins          University, Morgan State University and Howard University.  Special             effort is made to attract underrepresented groups to the program.               Participants work under the day-to-day supervision of faculty members           on research projects which the students have developed under the                guidance of a faculty mentor.  Students discuss their research projects         in a weekly seminar series which gives students experience in presenting        research plans and results and in discussing their work with their              peers.  A limited number of students will present results of their              projects at national meetings,, with financial support from the School          of Engineering.",
