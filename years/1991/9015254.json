 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two-year collaborative project between Wai-Fah                        Chen of Purdue University and H.B. Wu and S.P. Zhou of the                      Chongqing Institute of Architecture and Engineering of China                    (CIAEC).  It is supported by the National Science Foundation                    and the National Science Foundation of China.                                                                                                                   Stability analysis and design of steel structures is one of                     the most important structural engineering problems today.                       Several important structural stability problems of similar                      type exist in the United States and China, despite their                        differences in scale.  In this project, the principal inves-                    tigators will undertake full-scale experimental tests and                       analytical modeling to attempt to solve stability problems                      in steel framed structures.  The Purdue team will work                          principally on the expanded data bank for semi-rigid                            connections and on the basic mathematical formulation and                       computer-based model development.  The CIAEC team will work                     principally on the full-scale tests.  Each team will spend                      time in the other's facility.  It is expected that major                        findings resulting from the cooperative research will                           provide the necessary basis for possible next revision of                       current Specifications for Design, Fabrication and Erection                     of Structural Steel for Buildings, which are used in the                        United States and China.",
