 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimization of complex queries in future database systems  is a                major focus of this work.  The applicability of randomized                      algorithms for query optimization is investigated for several                   types of database systems, e.g., relational, object- oriented,                  and parallel systems.  Emphasis is placed on identifying the                    abstract characteristics of cost functions and data models that                 determine the effectiveness   of such algorithms.  Of special                   concern is also the propagation of errors in parameters that                    affect the query optimizer's decisions.  This research leads to                 developing techniques for query optimization in future systems                  where current technology is inadequate.  Another focus of this                  work is the study of specialized database systems for managing                  data from scientific experiments.  The emphasis is on graphical                 user interfaces and semantic heterogeneity.  Collaborating                      scientists from many disciplines provide guidelines for the                     goalsof this effort based on the needs of their laboratories.                   This research develops tools that enables such scientists to use                database technology effectively for their experiments.  Although                this work is driven by the specific needs of scientific                         databases, its results can be applied to solve many similar                     problems faced by next generation database systems in general.",
