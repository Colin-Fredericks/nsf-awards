 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nationally less than 50% of the students who originally choose                  a science or engineering major complete a degree in that major.                 It is clear that the problems of retaining interested students                  are severe enough that the traditional college physics                          laboratory approach must be questioned in a scientific way,                     using existing scientific knowledge on how people respond to                    teaching, how people learn new concepts, and how they                           incorporate new information.  In order to increase retention,                   this project is  restructuring social and intellectual                          interactions in the introductory physics laboratory in such a                   way that its operation is more in line with both the way modern                 students learn, and the way the scientific community deals with                 experimental information and evaluation of data.  \"Conferences\"                 and \"Public Reports\" are  being made a formal part of the                       laboratory.  The project actively and systematically considers                  special populations of students:  women, minorities, and future                 teachers.  Problems that research has identified as crucial are                 capsulized in the following:  1) a demand for narrative                         coherence; 2) a student-to-student approach to teaching                         problem-solving; 3) instructional strategies designed to                        produce a sense of community; and 4) establishment of a culture                 of competence and cooperation in the laboratory and classroom.                  The project postulates that these strategies will serve well                    all students.  The laboratory in introductory physics is the                    project's main focus.  The content of these introductory                        laboratories is staying close to observations connected to                      direct sensory and perceptual experiences.  The emphasis in                     this development is not on the design of \"new\" experiments, but                 1) on the interaction of the students, and 2) on the context                    and coherence of their total laboratory experience.  A strong                   evaluation plan is an integral part of the project.",
