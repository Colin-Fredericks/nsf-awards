 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to create a next workstation laboratory to complement                the two-semester, junior level sequence in electromagnetics                     required to all electrical engineering majors.  Initially, the                  laboratory would be an optional part of the courses, with perhaps               a few homework assignments requiring use of the laboratory.                     However, the goal would be to eventually integrate the laboratory               into the coursework in a more substantive role.                                                                                                                 To accomplish our objective we have already begun developing an                 interactive software package.  The programs developed are                       collective know as EM Notebooks.  To create the Noteboooks, a                   powerful software language called Mathematica is used.                          Mathematica has a feature that can be used to hierarchically                    structure text, equations, and graphics.  Thus, the EM Notebooks                contain animated sequences of EM phenomena such as waves                        propagating in a waveguide, and the user can interactively change               parameter, such as frequency, with the moving picture altering in               response.",
