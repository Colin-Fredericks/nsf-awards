 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                           Organometallic Chemistry Program to Clemson University to                       support the research of Dr. Gregory Robinson. Dr. Robinson's                    research deals with the design, synthesis, structure and                        reactivity of organoaluminum:amine complexes and provides                       needed structural data on coordination of main group elements.                  The interactions of organoaluminum moieties with macrocyclic                    amines, multidentate open-chain amines and nitrogen                             heterocycles will be investigated. Preliminary results indicate                 that these systems contain aluminum centers in unusual trigonal                 bipyramidal, square pyramidal and octahedral coordination                       environments.  The coordination of the aluminum atom(s) will be                 determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and aluminum-27                  NMR.  The thermal behavior of these unusual compounds and their                 feasibility to function as single-source molecular precursors                   for ceramic materials will be investigated.                                     %%%                                                                             Organoaluminum chemistry is an important but rather neglected                   area of organometallic chemistry. In addition to filling in                     serious gaps in our knowledge of aluminum chemistry, the                        project will result in the synthesis of new organoaluminum                      compounds which will be of potential value as precursors for                    the preparation of ceramic materials such as aluminum nitride.",
