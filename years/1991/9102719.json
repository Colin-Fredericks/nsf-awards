 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's recently discovered spontaneous, monodisperse,                         equilibrium vesicles in many mixtures of anionic and cationic                   surfactants.  In this program, they will characterize                           experimentally and model theoretically the process of vesicle                   formation in these systems.  This work will uncover a rich new                                                                                                  area of surfactant phase behavior and suggest new formations                    for stable vesicles useful in addressing theoretical and                        practical problems.  They will use a combination of                             experimental techniques including light, x-ray and neutron                      scattering, fluorescent probes, rheological measurements, and                   electron microscopy.  Simultaneously they will approach the                     problem from two distinct and complementary theoretical                         directions.  This work is significant because the properties                    of vesicles in these mixtures and the nature of the micelle-                    vesicle and vesicle-liquid crystal transitions is of keen                       scientific interest and considerable practical importance.                      This project has a broad scope and in order to achieve these                    goals expeditiously they will collaborate with several                          industrial and academic researchers.",
