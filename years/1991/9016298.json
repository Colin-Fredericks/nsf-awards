 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in algebra, geometry                   and computation between David Eisenbud of Brandeis University                   and Aron Simis of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in                     Brazil.  The subjects of collaboration are:  1) Special                         Determinantal varieties, 2) Rees Algebras, 3) Computational                     Methods, and 4) Weierstrass Points.  The first two subjects                     will make heavy use of computations made using a highly                         efficient computer algebra system oriented toward commutative                   algebra and algebraic geometry.  In addition to the work on                     these two projects Eisenbud and Simis will do collaborative                     work on Macaulay development, using some of the techniques                      that Simis has developed for his projects.  In addition, Rio                    is a center of work on Weierstrass points of curves.                                                                                                            The principal investigators on this project will receive                        support for a graduate student as well as some equipment.                       These are both strong mathematicians who have each made                         substantial contributions to commutative algebra and algebraic                  geometry.  The problems they pose to work on are central and                    important.",
