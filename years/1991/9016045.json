 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Mark Glauser, Clarkson University and two French scientists:                    Dr. Jean-Paul Bonnet and Dr. Joel Delville, both from the                       Laboratory for Aerodynamic Studies, University of Poitiers,                     France.  The object of the project is to investigate  the                       role that coherent structures play in practical turbulent                       flows, a topic of great interest and importance to the                          aerospace industry.                                                                                                                                             The investigators will examine coherent structures in five                      different shear layers, using all or part of the following                      techniques:  pseudo-flow visualization, proper orthagonal                       decomposition (POD) and dynamical systems theory.  The five                     flows are:  the plane mixing layer, the lobed mixer (a                          device used to generate streamwise vorticity), the axisymmetric                 jet mixing layer, the separated flow in an axisymmetric                         sudden expansion, and a supersonic wake.  The French research                   group will provide a significant contribution to this effort,                   since they have studied the plane shear layer extensively and                   are knowledgeable in the application of the pseudo flow                         visualization technique.  In addition, the University of                        Poitiers has unique facilities for the study of supersonic                      flow .",
