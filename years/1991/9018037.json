 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of these studies is to further our                      understanding of the molecular basis of the interaction between                 protein antigens and immune system receptors.  Dr. Paterson                     will use a model system consisting of monoclonal antibodies to                  a structurally defined protein, cytochrome c.  Dr. Paterson has                 obtained a specific antibody, E8, and is collecting x-ray data                  on the free and antigen complexed form in Dr. Elizabeth                         Getzoff's laboratory.  Dr. Paterson wishes to complete and                      extend these studies to other horse cytochrome c specific                       monoclonal antibodies and anti-idiotypic antibodies to E8.  She                 is also examining the  interaction of antibody/antigen                          complexes using hydrogen exchange and 2D NMR.  She has                          completed these studies on E8 and finds they agree well with                    previous epitopic assignments and with the general nature of                    antigenic sites on other proteins determined by other workers                   using x-ray crystallography.  This information from the                         antigenic epitopes on horse cytochrome c will be used to                        modulate antibody/antigen affinity through single residue                       changes in the antigen using site directed mutagenesis.  Dr.                    Paterson will also extend these studies to the lysozyme model                   antigen system for which x-ray structural data is known for two                 monoclonal antibodies. single residue changes in the antigen                    using site directed mutagenesis.  Dr. Paterson will also extend                 these studies to the lysozyme model antigen system for which                    x-ray structural data is known for two monoclonal antibodies.",
