 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                    Program will support continued work on iridium compounds by Dr.                 Jim D. Atwood of the State University of New York at Buffalo.                   The compounds are of general formula RIr(CO)L2, where R =                       alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxo, or chloro, and L = phosphine or                         substituted phosphine.  These species will be used to probe                     three areas: to model catalytic reactions in aqueous solution,                  to study reactivity of complexes containing mixtures of hard                    and soft ligands, and to study the reactivity of complexes with                 gaseous sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide.  The first two                        projects are relevant to optimizing catalytic reactions and the                 third project may have implications for reducing air pollutants.                                                                                                For the first project, sulfonated phosphines will be used in                    order to solubilize the species in aqueous solution.  In the                    second project, carbonate and sulfate ligands will be contained                 in the compounds, along with carbonyl and the alkoxy and                        phosphine groups.  Preliminary evidence on related complexes                    suggests that substitution reactions of compounds containing                    both hard and soft ligands are rapid, and this phenomenon will                  be specifically investigated.  In the third project, the                        substitution of sulfate ligands by sulfur dioxide and nitrous                   oxide will be investigated.  If such reaction occurs, the gases                 will be effectively absorbed by a solid.",
