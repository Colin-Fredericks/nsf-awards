 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine the potential that an array of molecules                with inducing properties involved in bacterial infection of plants              exists, and seeks to determine the chemistry, specificity, and                  roles of these molecules in plant-bacterial interactions.  The                  focus will be identification of signal compounds, the physiological             roles of inducers in the plant that produces them, and to a limited             extent, the receptors for these inducers.  It is expected that such             studies at detailed chemical and biological levels will lead to a               fuller understanding of events connected with establishment of, or              resistance to, bacterial infections in a variety of plants, and be              of value in broadening the spectrum of plants that can be                       transformed by bacteria such as those in the genus Agrobacterium.                                                                                               How plants, and the bacteria able to infect them, communicate with              each other at the molecular level to determine susceptibility or                resistance to infection is a prime focus of this study.  A fuller               understanding of these events may lead to the ability to transform              plant systems that are now recalcitrant to such genetic change.                   //",
