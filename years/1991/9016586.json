 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in solid state                   chemistry between Dr. Arthur Epstein, Ohio State University                     and Dr. J.P. Pouget, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France.                    The objective of the project is to investigate structural                       phenomema in quasi-one-dimensional systems.  More specifically,                 the researchers propose to explore the subtle relationships                     between local molecular and polymeric crystallographic order                    and electronic and magnetic phenomena in low dimensional                        solids, especially with respect to the polyaniline family of                    polymers and the ferromagnetic charge transfer salts.                                                                                                           The study of electronic and magnetic phenomena in low                           dimensional organic and organometallic solids has made                          revolutionary advances in the past two decades.  A key aspect                   of these advances is the exploration of properties of new                       material systems and determination of the dependence of these                   properties on subtle local structural phenomena. An essential                   aspect for the advancement of scientific study of these                         systems is the knowledge of the local structure and its                         variation with temperature and chemical modification.  This                     cooperative research program combines the structural expertise                  of the University of Paris-Sud group with the experience in                     integrated optical, magnetic and electrical studies of the                      Ohio State group.  Drs. Epstein and Pouget have a decade-long                   history of joint research efforts to uncover the effects of                     local order on the one and three dimensional electronic                         phenomena in molecular and polymeric systems.  Dr. Pouget's                     laboratory is one of the few in the world which is set up                       specifically to study the subtle orders in materials and Dr.                    Pouget himself is a leading authority in structural phenomena                   of low-dimensional solids.  The results of this research                        should significantly enhance understanding of the physical                      properties of polyaniline in terms of chemical structure.",
