 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins present within segments of the Golgi apparatus, a major                subcellular organelle system within eukaryotic cells, can be                    considered to be either resident proteins, i.e., proteins most of               whose lifetimes are spent in the organelle, or transient proteins,              i.e., proteins which are processed in the organelle but whose                   ultimate \"citizenship\" is elsewhere within the cell or                          extracellular milieu.  Based on previous results, three hypotheses              can be advanced to explain residency: (1) limited entry into                    transport vesicles, due to restricted mobility of resident versus               transient proteins, which results in the preferential inclusion of              transient protein in non-selective, bulk transport vesicles budding             from the Golgi apparatus; (2) preferential trapping of transient                versus resident proteins in Golgi transport vesicles with the                   mobility of both protein classes being similar; or (3) equal                    inclusion of both transient and resident proteins in Golgi                      transport vesicles with the resident proteins then being retrieved              after each round of transport.  Various combinations of these                   hypotheses are, of course, possible.  To test the validity of these             hypotheses, the mobility of two membrane proteins, a transient                  Golgi protein, the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, and a                  resident Golgi protein, a murine galactosyl transferase, will be                measured directly by confocal fluorescent recovery after                        photobleaching (cFRAP).  Recombinant DNA techniques will be used                to express the specific galactosyl transferase in cultured monkey               cells.  The cFRAP experiments will be done in collaboration with                Dr. Thomas Kreis, at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in               Heidelberg, Germany, using EMBL facilities.  Preparative work for               these experiments will be done at Virginia Polytechnic Institute                and State University in Blacksburg, VA.  In a second set of                     experiments, the relative enrichment of the transient and resident              Golgi proteins in isolated Golgi vesicles relative to isolated                  Golgi complexes will be assessed.  These experiments will be done               entirely at VPI-SU.                                                                                                                                             These experiments focus on an important problem in cell biology,                namely, how do specific proteins get to their functionally                      appropriate destinations within the compartmentalized cell?  The                results of these innovative experiments are expected to advance our             understanding of these critical cellular processes.",
