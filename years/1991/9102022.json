 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                   anthropologist studying large-scale population resettlement                     associated with an economic development project in China.  Using                methods of participant observation, surveys and intensive                       interviews of households, the project will study how people                     affected by resettlement can call upon their kinship networks to                develop creative solutions to the problems they face.  The theory               explaining how communities adapt to massive relocation and                      disruption has been developed from case studies in Africa, Latin                America and other areas, and this comparative case study will                   provide valuable material to advance our understanding.                                                                                                         This research is important because more and more communities in                 the developing world will be affected by massive hydroelectric                  projects which flood them out of their historic homelands, as                   energy costs increase.  This additional case study from a part of               the world where resettlement has not been studied                               ethnographically will advance our understanding of the abilities                of people in traditional communities to adapt to radical change.",
