 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a hypermedia, interactive data base                   that presents an audio/visual enthnography of world culture and                 provide the analytic tools for its analysis for classroom                       instruction in schools and colleges. This \"Global Jukebox\" will                 bring the world-view of anthropology to the classroom and will                  find wide use in teaching and research in human geography and                   other fields. The purpose of this data base is to make available                non-print materials and related data that capture the nature of                 human beings and the*l*;r culture. For example, the 20th century                brought a major advance for research in the performance arts, as                song and dance were recorded on tape and film in every part of                  the wotld, making it possible for the first time to study the                   whole range of the rhythmic arts. The Columbia University Cross-                Cultural Study of Expressive Behavior applied methods for the                   systematic descriptions of performance to large samples of                      audio/visual data from a stratified sample of cultures, where                   coded data on social relations was also available. Out of this                  comparative study came linked taxonomies of song, dance,                        orchestration and speech style, together with a body of social                  theory sufficient to explain the cross-cultural variations of                   style.                                                                                                                                                          This whole data-base, including its hundreds of illustrative                    selections of music, dance and speech, can now be made available                in an interactive media format. The GLOBAL JUKEBOX will allow                   laymen, students and specialists to explore the broad universe of               human creativity and culture in a systematic fashion, with                      audio/visual illustrations. This interactive learning facility                  realizes, indeed challenges, the potentials of present-day                      computing systems, stretching their capacities for storage,                     retrieval, analysis, and multi-tasking, in handling and                         presenting this multi-scalar, multi-modal audio/visual database.                For lay users, it will offer an enlightening vision of cultural                 variety and integrity. For students and specialists it will                     provide a platform for the study of expressive behavior in it                   total cultural context. The materials will be evaluated in                      schools, colleges and public libraries.",
