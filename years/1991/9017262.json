 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the University of Nebraska for                     funding of a facility that provides advanced mass spectrometric                 techniques through collaborations with researchers at Nebraska                  and at other institutions.  One of several approaches to mass                   spectrometry (MS), tandem MS provides high resolution                           measurements of compounds with the high molecular weights typical               of proteins, nucleic acids and other biopolymers.  Efforts                      sponsored by this award will focus on improving techniques for                  analysis of variety of proteins, carbohydrates and other natural                products using the tandem instrument; a variety of collaborative                research projects will be initiated or continued, and training                  activities at the pre- and post doctoral level will continue.                                                                                                   Mass spectrometry plays an increasingly important role in the                   structural analysis of biomolecules.  Information about protein                 sequence and structure, including naturally occurring                           modifications of proteins, and similar kinds of information about               polysaccharides and other branched chain polymers are obtained                  with great difficulty by other techniques.  Because of the                      considerable expense of acquisition and operation of tandem MS                  instruments, this type of mass spectrometric analysis is not                    routinely available at most research institutions.  The Nebraska                facility is one of only several in the country that provide                     researchers at numerous institutions with access to the kind of                 skilled mass spectrometry needed in many areas of modern                        biological research.",
