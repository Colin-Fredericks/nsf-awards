 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a graduate student in cultural anthropology               who will study the activities of people in Papua New Guinea who                 have left regional high schools before graduation to return to                  their villages.  These \"secondary school leavers\" have                          participated in both traditional and Western forms of education,                and the project will investigate the impact of this \"Western\"                   experience on the traditional forms of education.  Methods                      include participant observation, in-depth interviews with                       teachers and students, a household survey of a local community,                 and participant observation and focused interviews at four                      regional high schools.                                                                                                                                          This research is important because people from diverse cultures                 are engaged with \"Western\" style schooling all over the world,                  with varying degrees of success.  Knowledge about how forms of                  classroom education differ and are similar to traditional forms                 of indigenous education will help educational planners devise                   programs to increase the chances for success of multi-cultural                  educational programs in other settings and nations.",
