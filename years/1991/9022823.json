 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to extend the investigators                     recent work on irreversible investment decisions in a number of                 interesting and important directions.  One of the directions is                 the impact of the uncertainty of future environmental regulation                on business investment.  A related topic that will also be                      investigated is the problem of environmental irreversibilities                  and their implications for the design of policies to deal with                  global warming, ozone depletion, and related long-term problems.                Another topic is aimed at deriving investment rules for projects                in which the ultimate cost of completion is unknown, but is                     resolved as construction proceeds as in the case of electric                    power plants.  Another study will focus on the measurement of                   economic depreciation and obsolescence, and the decision to                     replace old capital with new.  At issue is how stochastic wear                  and tear, and uncertainty over the future productivity of capital               can affect the replacement decision, and how they should be                     accounted for when calculating depreciation.  The final project                 involves the study of investment in R&D and the adoption of new                 technologies.  In particular, the trade-offs between adopting a                 current technology, waiting for new technology to arrive, or                    conducting R&D that can lead to a new technology will be                        examined.",
