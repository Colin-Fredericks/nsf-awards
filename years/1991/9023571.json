 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for career advancement under the Research                      Opportunities for Women program of the National Science Foundation.             The principal investigator intends to enhance her career in                     research by collaborating with investigators at the University of               California, Berkeley in the study of the interfaces in                          aggregate/cement and steel/cement systems. Particular emphasis will             be placed on the relationship between interface morphology and the              corrosion initiation of steel in concrete. Specimens of concrete                with embedded steel rebars will be subjected to controlled                      environment, such as sodium salt solution, for various periods of               time. During the test the open-circuit potential, which has been                shown to be a good indicator of corrosion initiation, will be                   monitored. Periodically, the tests will be interrupted and the                  hydration phases and pore distribution at the interface will be                 analyzed using back-scattering electron imaging coupled with an                 image analyzer. The effects of admixtures will be studied by                    preparing concrete specimens with 10 weight percent replacement of              cement by silica fume. The research is intended to contribute to                the knowledge and understanding of concrete microstructural                     properties and their impact on the corrosion process of steel in                concrete.",
