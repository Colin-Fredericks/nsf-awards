 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will integrate two new components into a                            preservice elementary and secondary teacher education                           program.  The purpose of the integrated program is the                          development in preservice teachers of conceptions of                            teaching science consistent with recent research in science                     education.  One new component is a conceptual change model                      for science teacher education; the other is and action                          research component to assist students to become teachers who                    are reflective about their practice particularly with                           respect to the use of conceptual change teaching strategies.                    The project will concentrate on students' teaching of                           biology.                                                                                                                                                        Twenty students in two cohorts (five elementary and five                        secondary in each cohort) will be interviewed and their                         teaching observed and, in some instances, video recorded                        throughout the program.  This consists of a semester of                         methods and a school-based practicum followed by a semester                     of student teaching, with an action research seminar through                    both semesters.  Science methods classes and action research                    seminars will be observed and the professors interviewed.                       Case studies of each student will document factors that                         influence their progress toward adoption of appropriate                         conceptions of science teaching.  Eight students selected                       from the two cohorts ( for elementary and four secondary)                       will be followed into their first year of teaching to                           document what happens to their conceptions of the teaching                      of biology when confronted with the reality of schools.  A                      further twenty students will, divided as before, will serve                     as a comparison group.  They will be interviewed and have                       the same methods, practicum, and student teaching                               experiences, but not the action research seminar.                               Successful implementation of the components of the project                      will meet NSF's goals of strengthening science education for                    students in elementary and secondary schools by preparing                       science teachers who are autonomous, capable and reflective                     professionals.                                                                                                                                                  The cost sharing for this project is 20+% of the NSF costs.",
