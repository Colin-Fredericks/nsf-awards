 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Anthony Marks, Mr. Nuno Bicho, a                     graduate student at Southern Methodist University, will collect                 data for his doctoral dissertation.  He will study a series of                  lithic assemblages from the Estremadura region of Portugal and                  which date from 16,500 to 8,500 BP (before present).  These                     materials have been excavated from a number of sites all located                in the Rio Maior river valley.  While all materials fall within a               single archaeologically-defined \"cultural tradition\" they show a                significant amount of variation among individual assemblages and                Mr. Bicho wishes to understand the reason for this.  A number of                potential explanations have been put forward.  These range from                 the possibility that different cultural groups are responsible to               the hypothesis that variation is based on task specific factors.                To resolve this issue Mr. Bicho will conduct detailed analyses of               lithic artifacts.  He will distinguish between the form of the                  artifact and the technique by which it was produced.  He                        (reasonably) assumes that form will reflect task specificity                    while production technique relates more closely to cultural                     affiliation.                                                                                                                                                    The Magdalenian peoples were among the first in Europe to develop               specialized subsistence technologies.  They produced magnificent                works of art such as the paintings in Lascaux.  While they have                 been relatively well studied in Southwestern France and Northern                Spain, their geographical range extends well beyond this area.                  Mr. Bicho's work will contribute to a broader understanding of                  the Magdalenians and how they adapted to the rapidly changing                   environmental conditions at the end of the last Ice Age.  In                    particular, it should provide insight into their social                         organization. This research also examines basic issues in lithic                studies and will help to develop an analytic approach which will                be useful in many archaeological situations.                                                                                                                    Because the prehistory of Portugal is not well known, this work                 will be of interest to a large number of archaeologists.  It will               also contribute to the education of an extremely promising young                scientist.",
