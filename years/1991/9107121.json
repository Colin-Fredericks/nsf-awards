 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new dual-cell Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR)              device will be used to obtain detailed mechanistic, kinetic, and                thermochemical information for a number of ions of current                      interest. Three areas will be investigated: (1) bimolecular                     reactions of radical cations, where the charge and radical sites                are separated (distonic ions); (2) the stability and reactivity of              solvent-free reactions of diazonium ions, which are important                   intermediates in organic chemistry; and (3) the structure,                      chemical properties, and stabilities of dicoordinated phosphorous               cations (phosphenium ions). This will also yield heats of                       formation for various interesting neutral, electron-deficient                   phosphorous compounds.                                                          %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research              of Dr. Hilkka I. Kenttamaa at Purdue University. Positively                     charged ions will be generated in the gas-phase by bombarding                   molecules with electrons. These ions will be trapped for various                periods of time in a specially designed cell, so that their                     reactions can be examined as a function of time. By this means,                 the rate at which these reactions proceed and the energy of these               unusual ions in the gas-phase will be determined. Comparisons will              be made between some of these reactions in the gas-phase and in                 solution to determine the effect of solvent molecules.",
