 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing the Minority Scientist Pool is a three-year                        project (1991-1994) which consists of an intensive academic                     support program coupled with an early  research experience.                     It is designed to involve 15 minority students each year in an                  undergraduate program that leads to a career in the laboratory                  sciences.  Eight project students will major in chemistry, six                  in biology, and one in physics.  While enrolled in a degree-                    seeking program, project students will be involved in an                        academic support system which includes counseling, tutoring,                    study groups, support classes and cultural enhancing                            activities.  All students will be assigned to mentors who will                  engage them in a summer research project at the end of the                      first academic year.  During the remainder of the project                       years, mentors will engage project students in research                         projects during the academic years and summers.  The progress                   of project students will be closely monitored throughout the                    project.",
