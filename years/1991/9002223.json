 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the participation of Dr. Geoffrey Kamau of the            University of Nairobi in an ongoing, long-term project to develop new           electrocatalytic approaches for destruction of halogenated organic              pollutants in aqueous surfactant media.  Specific aims for the two-year         period of this collaborative component center around optimizing                 experimental design factors to attain significantly faster                      dehalogenation rates.  The broad, long-term goals of the research               project are to make possible new strategies for permanently effective           detoxification of contaminated materials such as sediments, soils, and          industrial oils, and to provide new insights into toxic and                     environmental interactions of organohalides by establishing fundamental         kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of their electron-transfer            reactions.                                                                                                                                                      Environmental contamination with organohalide chemicals is a worldwide          problem.  Dehalogenation methods being developed should be directly             applicable to other pollutants as well.  The project is consistent with         the criteria for the Science in Developing Countries (SDC) program in           that it strengthens collaboration between U.S. scientists and engineers         and their counterparts in developing countries, and increases the               capacity of scientists and engineers in developing countries to address         constraints to development.",
