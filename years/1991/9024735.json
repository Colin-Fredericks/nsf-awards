 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an infrastructure award to support the acquisition of              a high speed network of data servers, computation servers, parallel             processors, and workstations for the support of research in                     software, artificial intelligence, and parallel algorithms.  The                software research is in operating systems, wireless distributed                 systems, parallel processing, and software engineering.  The                    artificial intelligence research is in intelligent multimedia                   interfaces and vision and robotics.  The parallel algorithms                    research is in parallel string matching with applications to genome             matching.                                                                            New networking technologies make it possible to support                    computation intensive activities distributed across networks.  This             support requires new software tools that will support distributed               and parallel computing.  This award is for the infrastructure                   necessary to test this new software and also for the infrastructure             necessary for research in robotics and parallel algorithms for                  large information system searches.  The operating system research               concentrates on a high performance operating system for distributed             and parallel computers.  The distributed systems research is for                research in wireless distributed computing in which the                         transmission medium consists of radio waves.  This research                     promises the true portable workstation in which no wires whatsoever             are needed in order to access the network.  Both the parallel                   processing and the software engineering research involve rule based             systems.  The parallel processing research uses rule based systems              to distribute computational tasks while the software engineering                research uses rule based systems to coordinate cooperative work                 amongst multiple software developers.  The multimedia research                  involves the construction of virtual realities for the manipulation             of multi-dimensional data.  The example application area is                     financial data.  The vision and robotics research is aimed at                   processing multiple sources of spatial data in order to navigate a              robot in a natural environment and to control robot manipulators.               Finally, the parallel algorithms research is concentrated on string             matching algorithms applicable to data arising from genome                      databases.  This research is important for actually using large                 databases that will arise from the human genome project.",
