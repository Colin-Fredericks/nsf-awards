 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peroxides occur in atmospheric rain, fog and snow samples in               concentrations as high as several hundred micromolar.  In                       addition to its deleterious effects on human health and plant                   growth, hydrogen peroxide is generally believed to be the                       principal oxidant for sulfur dioxide in the Northeastern United                 States, resulting in enhanced acidity of cloudwater.  Recent work               has shown that organic peroxides oxidize sulfur dioxide at rates                comparable to that of hydrogen peroxide, and some field                         measurements suggest that organic and hydrogen peroxides may                    occur in the atmosphere in similar concentrations.  In spite of                 their importance, we are not certain what fraction of total                     atmospheric peroxides are organic, nor do we have a complete                    understanding of the processes which produce and destroy them.                  This grant supports laboratory and field studies aimed at a                     better understanding of peroxide occurrence and chemistry.  Using               a newly developed technique, we will analyze precipitation                      samples for organic and hydrogen peroxide.",
