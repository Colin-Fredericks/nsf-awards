The purpose of the project is to assist and                          prepare college mathematics faculty members throughout                          Kentucky to teach elementary and middle grades preservice                       teachers.  The professional development program will take                       place over a period of two summers and the included                             academic year.  For one week each summer, the participants                      will be in workshops working with national consultants,                         with experienced mathematics educators from the state, and                      with classroom teachers including Presidential Award                            Winners in Mathematics.  The focus will be the                                  implementation of the National Council of Teachers of                           Mathematics Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School                      Mathematics and the Professional Teaching Standards, as                         well as the Call For Change from the Mathematics                                Association of America. Throughout the year, the group will                     meet at least two additional times with funding for the                         additional meetings from the Exxon Foundation and support                       from two state organizations, The Kentucky Council of                           Teachers of Mathematics and the Kentucky Chapter of the                         Mathematics Association of America.  A new state                                organization, The Kentucky Mathematics Association of                           Teachers of Teachers was organized during the process of                        formulating the proposal and the group will work with the                       PI throughout the project and after funding ends to                             continue the faculty development and network.  A newsletter                     will also be published to connect participants to each                          other and to give information on state and national issues,                     resources and materials, and professional meetings.                                                                                                                  This project has the potential of being an exemplary                       model for mathematics faculty development in a state or                         region.                                                                                                                                                              Participants will be selected from public and                              private institutions, including two-year colleges, in                           Kentucky and funding for their travel will be assumed by                        their individual institutions.                                                                                                                                       Cost-sharing by Western Kentucky University, by the                        Exxon Foundation, and by other institutions of higher                           education in Kentucky is 51%  of the total cost requested                       from NSF.",
