 "awd_abstract_narration": "Escherichia coli transcription termination protein rho employs                  an RNA-dependent ATPase activity to effect transcript release                   from paused transcription complexes.  The PI is studying the                    molecular mechanism of the rho ATPase reaction using                            enzymological, biochemical, and molecular biological                            techniques, in order to understand its role in transcription                    termination .  The knowledge gained will prove useful to the                    broader question of RNA-protein interactions and to the                         understanding of energy-transducing ATPases. In the present                     proposal, studies of rho ATPase activity are continued, and an                  investigation of rho-RNA interactions is begun. RHO is thought                  to use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move with respect to the                 RNA chain of transcription complexes.  Rho binds to this RNA                    and releases it from RNA polymerase and the DNA template.  The                  postulated mechanism for such movement is the ATP hydrolysis-                   dependent binding and release of the nascent RNA.  From earlier                 work on rho-ATP interactions it is predicted that RNA should                    bind to rho ATP complexes much more tightly than to rho ADP.Pi                  complexes, and an experiment had been designed to test this                     prediction.  To test whether rho uses the energy of ATP                         hydrolysis to travel with respect to RNA, Dr. Stitt and co-                     workers have developed a system to measure the amount of ATP                    hydrolyzed per RNA chain released.  This system is being used                   in a normal rho-dependent release; it will also be employed in                  a system in which an insert has been made between the rho                       binding site and the end of the transcript.  If rho used ATP                    energy to travel along RNA, it should use more ATP in the                       system where it has to travel further.  The sites on rho of its                 interaction with RNA have only vaguely been localized; RNA                      crosslinking  experiments will be used to better  define them.                  Rho shows a requirement for RNA to activate its ATPase                          activity, although the DNA poly(dC) binds as well to rho as the                 RNA poly(C).  Mixed RNA-DNA oligonucleotides of defined                         sequence will be used to identify the locations on RNA where                    the 2'OH is critical for rho ATPase activation.",
