 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will investigate the processing and properties                of superplastically deformed silicon nitride-based and mullite                  ceramic materials to develop constitutive relationships describing              the creep strain-deformation behavior of polycrystalline ceramics               and to develop processes for the superplastic forming of simple                 components, including the gas blow-forming of ceramic sheets and                the diffusion bonding of superplastic ceramics.                                      Superplastic forming involves the slow deformation of the                  component into the desired shape at high temperatures and under                 conditions under which fracture does not occur.  While superplastic             forming has been applied with some success to metallic materials,               titanium alloys in particular, the application of the process to                the forming of ceramics is highly novel.  Ceramic materials are                 extremely difficult to form and finish, normally requiring grinding             operations which may damage the surface and cause failure.                      Therefore, the ability to deform solid ceramics into shaped parts               would be a major advance.",
