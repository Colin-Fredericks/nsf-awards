 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in systematic                    biology between Dr. Janice Moore, Colorado State University                     and two British scientists:  Dr. Paul Harvey, Department of                     Zoology, University of Oxford, and Dr. D.W.T. Crompton,                         Department of Zoology, University of Glasgow.  The objective                    of the research is to develop and use phylogenetic techniques                   to examine the role of host evolution in parasite-host                          interactions.                                                                                                                                                   The evolution of parasite-host interactions has been approached                 from the standpoint of host benefit (e.g. resistance to                         parasites) and parasite benefit (e.g. manipulation of host                      behavior), but has not been addressed from a phylogenetic                       perspective.  In a set of strictly comparable behavioral                        experiments, Dr. Moore is currently examining the effect of                     the acanthocephalan, Moniliformis, on the behavior of ten                       species of related cockroaches.  During a long term research                    visit at Oxford University,  Dr Moore will extend analytical                    techniques developed there to host-parasite phenomena and                       will investigate the role of host phylogeny in parasite-                        induced behavioral alterations.  During a subsequent research                   stay at the University of Glasgow, Dr. Moore will quantify                      degrees of resistance to the parasite exhibited by these same                   host species and apply the same techniques to elucidate the                     contribution, if any, of host phylogeny to parasite resistance.                 During this research year, Dr. Moore will be able to interact                   with major figures in the area of evolutionary biology,                         ethology, parasite ecology and parasite resistance, and to                      extend comparative analytical techniques developed for free-                    living taxa to host-parasite interactions.  This will be the                    first quantitative step towards placing these phenomena in a                    predictive, evolutionary frame.",
