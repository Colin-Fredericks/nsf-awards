 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will study the                  phase transition between the Haldane phase and the dimerized                    phase in the spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic, one-dimensional               quantum spin system.  In particular, he will prove that this                    phase transition does indeed exist by showing that an order-                    parameter proposed for this transition is zero in one phase and                 nonzero in the other.  In addition, the principal investigator                  will continue his rigorous study of the majority rule                           renormalization group transformation for Ising-type systems.                    Finally he will study the existence of continuous spectra for the               infinite volume limit of the Hamiltonian of a quantum spin                      system.                                                                              The behavior of matter at the microscopic scale is very                    often what determines the behavior of matter at the macroscopic                 or observable scales of ordinary life.  For example, what we call               the temperature of a liquid or gas is simply the macroscopic or                 cumulative effect of the motion of countless atoms and molecules                on the microscopic scale of the material.  In this project the                  principal investigator will study various mathematical models of                the behavior of atoms at the microscopic or quantum level, in                   order to establish connections between microscopic and                          macroscopic properties of matter.",
