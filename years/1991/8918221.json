 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year renewal of a U.S.-Yugoslav                     cooperative research project in nuclear physics between Miroslav                Furic of Zagreb University and Ed V. Hungerford of the University of            Houston is to continue their examination of the dynamics of                     three-nucleon absorption modes of pions, muons and kaons and their              dependence on energy and other variables.  The calculational and                theoretical work will be carried out primarily at the University of             Zagreb, and joint experiments are planned at the University of                  Houston.  The Yugoslav team will also play an important role in the             construction of a large acceptance detector.                                                                                                                    This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The award,                except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav             institution.",
