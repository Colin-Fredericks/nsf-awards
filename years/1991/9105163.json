 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the research described is to develop transformed plant               varieties with enhanced freezing tolerance through the expression               of antifreeze proteins that inhibit ice crystal growth.  We have                shown that tobacco and tomato plants transformed with a winter                  flounder antifreeze gene express high levels of the corresponding               mRNA.  Furthermore, the gene was modified so that the encoded                   protein is larger and more readily detected.  In plants containing              this fusion protein, antifreeze expression was observed at the RNA,             protein and activity level, with transcriptional levels                         predominating.                                                                                                                                                  We will now evaluate the impact of antifreeze protein on the                    freezing tolerance properties of fruit from transgenic plants as                well as from nontransgenic fruits that have been infiltrated with               antifreeze protein.  If necessary, we will optimize the protein                 concentration in plant tissue by enhancing protein activity,                    protein stability, transcription, and translatability.                          Constructions resulting in optimal freezing tolerance will be                   transferred into appropriate commercial varieties.***//",
