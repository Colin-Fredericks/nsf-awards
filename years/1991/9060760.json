 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical an surface chemistry and in the               subfield of catalysis.  Development of efficient, long-lived                    catalysts for selective metathesis of functionalized olefins will               enable preparation of both new organic compounds and those that can             not now be prepared in useful quantities by existing methods.                   These are compounds which will, because of the variety of                       functional groups they contain, find application as intermediates               in many applications of commercial interest.  Catalytica has                    successfully developed catalyst systems for metathesis of methyl                oleate, an olefinic ester where the functionality is remote from                the double bound.                                                                                                                                               The proposed Phase I program endeavors to significantly extend the              demonstrated scope of functionalized olefin metathesis for a                    catalyst system of established practical utility.  The substrates               selected for investigation are chosen to test fundamental                       extensions of the catalyst system.  Performance of the catalyst in              the presence of other representative functional groups, in the                  presence of functional groups substituted on positions closer to                the double bond, and on more highly-substituted olefins will be                 determined.  The products of the proposed metathesis reactions are              multi-functional intermediates suitable for application in the                  production of new polymer materials, flavor and fragrance                       compounds, pharmaceuticals and lubricants.",
