 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the problem of how the information                    contained in the amino acid sequence of a secreted or a membrane                protein determines the precise topology of insertion into or                    through the membrane.  This is a fundamental problem in cell                    biology.  Positively charged residues, often found located near                 the boundaries of transmembrane segments of proteins, appear to                 be involved in specifying the orientation of membrane proteins.                 This proposal examines in detail to what extent positively                      charged residues play a part in this process and the mechanism by               which proteins obtain their unique membrane topology in                         Escherischia coli.  The aims of the proposal are: 1, to determine               whether inner membrane proteins, like other exported proteins in                E. coli, require molecular chaperones for their membrane                        assembly; 2, to define genetically the parts of the proteins that               participate in their membrane assembly; 3, to evaluate the                      mechanisms of membrane insertion for simple and complex membrane                proteins; 4, to establish the general role of positively charged                domains in protein orientation; and 5, to determine how                         positively charged residues exert their effect on topology.  This               work will be done with the E. coli leader peptidase, subunit H of               the photosynthetic reaction center, procoat, lac permease, and                  outer membrane protein A. A variety of approaches will be used,                 including in vivo and in vitro techniques.  Protease mapping and                biochemical methods will determine how positive charges exert                   their effect on protein topology.                                                                                                                               These studies in protein membrane assembly will eventually help                 answer some of the fundamental questions in cellular biology                    concerning protein compartmentalization.",
