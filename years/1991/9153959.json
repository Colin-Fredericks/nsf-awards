 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for exploratory small grant funding for the collation          and summary of telecommunications-in-education research applicable to           the use of large-scale wide-area networks in the science classroom and          the prompt dissemination of that information to the facilitators of             state and national education networks.                                                                                                                          The purpose of this project is to facilitate future research in                 educational telecommunications, and to collate and provide information          useful to the initial phases of state-wide and national                         telecommunications-in-education networks.  Several states, and several          commercial organizations are already offering or are about to offer from        September 1991 or September 1992 access to large scale                          telecommunications facilities to schools.                                                                                                                       Though a considerable amount of research has been done on individual            small scale networks and on small group components of large-scale               networks, this research is neither easily accessible nor wholly relevant        to the large-scale situation.  As yet,l we have very little information         on the effects of scaling up from the base of research-oriented                 prototype networks.                                                                                                                                             Also, the creation of these new telecommunications applications and new         network communities in education is taking place extremely quickly.  If         these developments are to be constructive advances in teaching and              learning strategies it is imperative that these new efforts should be           informed by prior experience and research.                                                                                                                      In order to establish a baseline of relevant information in a timely            fashion, it is proposed that NSF should fund a limited research                 initiative between April 1, 1991 and September 1,l 1991.  The initiative        will have three components - the collation of existing research, a              demonstration study of an academic network, and a demonstration study of        a global-scale K-12 network.",
