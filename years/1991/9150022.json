 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teachers College, Columbia University, will carry out a                         project which will develop curriculum and create student                        teaching experiences at the High School for Teaching in New                     York City.  The High School for Teaching is part of a network                   of special-interest magnet high schools established by the New                  York City School System, and its student body is 88% minority.                                                                                                  This school attracts students from across the city who plan to                  go into teaching careers and develops innovative programs to                    support their career choice.  The goals of this project are                     two-fold:  (1) to give preservice teachers an outstanding                       field experience in teaching secondary science in an urban                      setting, and (2) to attract and enable high school students at                  HST to pursue a career in teaching science.  The University's                   cost-sharing is 11.5% of NSF's contribution.",
