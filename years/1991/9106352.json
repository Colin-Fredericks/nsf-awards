 "awd_abstract_narration": "Presently, there is only limited and indirect in vivo evidence                  supporting any of the proposed functions of the signal recognition              particle (SRP) deduced from in vitro studies.  Specific objectives              of this project are to confirm an in vivo role in secretion for                 SRP, to examine in vivo translational arrest mediated by SRP, and               to initiate studies of regulation of 7S RNA synthesis.  These                   studies will be done with the genetically tractable yeast, Yarrowia             lipolytica. It has two SCR genes coding for functional 7S RNAs, and             it secretes high levels of a protease (AEP).  Mutated genes coding              for SRP components will be introduced into Y. lipolytica, and the               effects on synthesis and translocation of secretory proteins                    determined by pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiments using                 AEP-related polypeptides as reporter molecules.  Three interrelated             lines of research will be conducted.   First, scr1-1, a mutation                of SCR1 which results in translational arrest of AEP synthesis,                 will be further characterized.  Second, SRP will be purified, sizes             of the protein subunits determined, partial amino acid sequences                of the Y. lipolytica homologues of Srp14p and Srp54p obtained, and              the SRP14 and SRP54 genes cloned and sequenced.  Conditional                    mutations will be isolated, and their effects on AEP synthesis and              secretion determined.  Third, SCR regulation will be studied by                 determining the role of a 5' consensus sequence on SCR1 and SCR2                RNA synthesis.                                                                                                                                                  The presumed function of the signal recognition particle, as                    deduced from in vitro studies, is to recognize the amino-terminal               signal peptide leader sequence of nascent proteins destined for                 sequestration in the endoplasmic reticulum, and facilitate protein              translocation to that organelle.  SRP binds to the signal peptide               of the nascent protein, transiently arresting further translation.              The peptide-bound SRP then binds to a receptor on the cytoplasmic               side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane; this results in                     dissociation of the peptide from the SRP at the site of                         translocation across the ER membrane.  The experiments to be                    carried out will extend our understanding of the function of SRP                and provide information derived from in vivo studies.  SRP and the              secretory process in general is well-studied in yeasts,                         particularly S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, and it has become clear                that there are significant differences between those two yeasts in              this process.  Yarrowia lipolytica, which is not closely related                to either of the better-studied yeasts, has a very high secretory               capacity and is currently being developed as a cellular factory for             the commercial production of genetically-engineered proteins.  A                better understanding of the secretion process in this yeast is                  therefore significant not only because of the basic information                 that can be derived, but also because of the potential contribution             to biotechnology through improved commercial yields of genetically-             engineered proteins.",
