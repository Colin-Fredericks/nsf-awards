 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in solar                         system astronomy between Dr. Douglas Lin, University of                         California at Santa Cruz, and three British scientists:  Dr.                    Sverre Aarseth, Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge University,                   and Drs. John Papaloizou and Philip Palmer, School of                           Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary and Westfield College,                        London.  The objective of the project is to investigate the                     formation of prototerrestrial planets and protogiant                            planetary cores in the solar nebula environment.                                                                                                                The specific tasks are:  1) to develop an analytical model                      for the dynamics of planetesimals, 2) to carry out N-body                       numerical simulations to examine the dynamical evolution and                    mass coagulation of planetesimals, 3) to investigate the                        effects of hydrodynamic drag and tidal interaction on the                       dynamics of planetesimals and protoplanets, and 4) to                           determine the dynamical impact of protoplanets on the                           structure and evolutions of the solar nebula.  These                            theoretical investigations will be carried out with the aid                     of analytic formalisms and numerical schemes recently                           developed by the investigators.  Data from solar system                         exploration and ground based observations of protostellar                       disks around young stellar objects will be used to constrain                    theoretical models. The project will benefit from the                           complementary expertise of the investigators and their                          successful history of past collaboration.  Results of this                      research will contribute to the understanding of the origin                     of the solar system, one of the most outstanding problems in                    astrophysics and planetary science.",
