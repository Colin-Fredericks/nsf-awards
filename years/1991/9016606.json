 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will facilitate cooperation between Dr. Frederick                    H. Mies, Molecular Physics Division, Center for Atomic,                         Molecular, and Optical Physics, National Institute of                           Standards and Technology (NIST), and Professor Hiroki                           Nakamura, Department of Theoretical Studies, Institute for                      Molecular Science (IMS), Okazaki, and members of their research                 groups.  Collaboration between these two research groups                        provides a unique opportunity to exploit two complementary                      skills in molecular scattering theory.  The NIST group                          generally employs the fully quantal close-coupled approach to                   calculate inelastic and photodissociation cross-sections.                       The IMS group has devoted its research to the complementary                     semiclassical description of such processes.  The objective                     of this collaborative project is to borrow the best features                    of each method to obtain a more complete description of                         molecular dynamics and spectroscopy.  The two groups have                       already begun an extensive collaboration at this common                         interface of the two methods with extremely encouraging                         preliminary results.  During this project, the scientists                       will visit each other's two laboratories to transfer computer                   codes, compare results, and analyze the data.                                                                                                                   This collaborative project has two major goals.  First, the                     scientists will explore the limits of the quantal and                           semiclassical methods with numerically tractable examples.                      Second, they will use this experience to develop hybrid                         techniques and new approximations that enjoy the benefits of                    both methods.  The goal is to use semiclassical theory to                       provide the necessary MQDT (multichannel quantum defect                         theory) parameters to treat the dynamics and photodissociation                  of triatomic systems.  The focus will be the photodissociation                  of strongly bound triatomics, using atmospheric molecules as                    candidates for study.",
