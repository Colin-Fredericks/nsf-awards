 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Division of Biology and                        Biomedical Sciences at Washington University to continue a                      Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site that was established               last year.  Twelve undergraduates, from a diversity of collegiate               and ethnic backgrounds, will be recruited to spend 8-12 summer                  weeks engaged in developmental biology research with faculty                    mentors who will be selected, on the basis of mutual interests,                 from the about 30 developmental biologists on the faculty.  These               staff members have active, well-equipped and funded research                    groups working on a wide range of developmental problems, ranging               from mating and zygote formation in Chlamydomonas, through organ-               specific gene expression in transgenic plants, and control of                   germ cell differentiation in nematodes, to formation of patterned               connections in the mammalian CNS.  The emphasis of the program                  will be on getting each student actively engaged in increasingly                independent research in one of these productive laboratories.                   However, to help the students view their own research in a                      broader scientific and professional context, four supplementary                 activities will be provided: (1) Five days during the early part                of the program will be devoted to introducing the REU students to               some of the major research models and methods of contemporary                   developmental biology, and hands-on laboratory experiences.  (2)                In each odd-numbered week a member of the participating faculty                 will present an informal research seminar and discussion,                       designed specifically for these students.  (3) In even-numbered                 weeks, the students will participate with Washington University                 graduate students, postdocs and faculty in an ongoing                           Developmental Biology Journal Club.  (4) At the end of the                      summer, a weekend retreat will be held at which students in this                program, together with other summer undergraduate research                      students, will present the results of their summer research                     either orally or as poster papers.  A number of social                          activities, designed to bring the students and faculty together                 more often on an informal basis, will also be sponsored by the                  program and the Division.",
