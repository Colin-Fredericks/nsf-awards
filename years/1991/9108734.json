 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to experimentally examine                    the effects of radiative heat transfer on the coagulation                       rates of soot particles formed in hydrocarbon flames.  Recent                   theoretical studies micrometer sized, carbonaceous soot                         particles in high-temperature gases, indicated that particles                   cooler than the gas can have diffusion and coagulation rates                    one order of magnitude greater than those predicted from                        conventional Brownian dynamics.  A net radiative absorption by                  the particle, on the other hand, can act to decrease or freeze                  the coagulation rate.  In the proposed work, the theoretical                    predictions will be directly examined through measurement of                    the size, number density, and coagulation rate of soot                          particles.  Particle measurements will be performed using non-                  intrusive laser light extinction and scattering methods.                                                                                                        Demonstration of a relationship between radiation and soot                      particle dynamics would provide valuable insight into the                       factors affecting combustion particulate transport and growth,                  and would have important consequences on the scaling of                         particle dynamical models from small to large scale                             combustion, environments.  In addition, the results will e                      used for the development of new methods of particulate control                  and removal from combustion exhaust gases.      //",
