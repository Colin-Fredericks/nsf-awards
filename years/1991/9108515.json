 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our understanding of spontaneous mutation is still very incomplete              Our information comes from disparate sources.  The best studies on              the spectrum of molecular changes involve somatic mutations in                  microorganisms.  Less is known about germinal mutations in                      eukaryotes, although these are the source of variability for                    evolution. There have been measurements of rates of germinal                    mutations, but their rarity has limited the investigation of the                relative likelihood of different kinds of alterations (base                     substitutions, insertions, deletions, transposition) among these                mutants.  In the case of mutant genes for inherited diseases in                 humans, there is extensive information, but vexing questions about              selection leave us uncertain as to the frequency and the spectrum               of the original mutations.  Germinal mutations result from a series             of rounds of mitosis followed by meiosis.  Little is known about                the role of meiosis in producing new mutants or in screening or                 modifying those mutants which have emerged from the preceding                   mitotic divisions.  The vegetative growth habit of Neurospora is                ideally designed for the analysis of spontaneous  mutations.  The               mutants arise in the selectively neutral environment of the                     coenocyte and are revealed for assay in the asexual spores.                     Ascospores provide convenient material for the deletion of meiotic              mutations, and the distribution of mutants in the fruiting bodies               reveals which mutants are the products of the sexual cycle.  A                  comparison of these mutants to those from vegetative cells will                 bridge the gap between somatic and germinal mutation.  We propose               a detailed analysis of spontaneous mutation at a specific locus in              Neurospora.mtr is the structural gene for the neutral amino acid                permease, and it offers special advantages for mutation studies.                Selective plating can be used to detect rare mutants (or                        recombinants) going in either direction: from wildtype to mtr or                the reverse.  The gene has been cloned, so probes are available to              examine the molecular properties of mtr mutants.",
