 "awd_abstract_narration": "Receptors are proteins which act as signal transducers in living                organisms.  A variety of neurotransmitters and hormones can                     regulate the activity of a wide range of functions such as                      maintaining blood pressure and heart rate, learning and memory or               vision.  A desired response depends on a specific receptor type.                Therefore, knowledge of the three dimensional structure of                      receptor molecules will lead to an understanding of what                        determines specificity and how the neurotransmitter or hormone is               translated by a cell to produce a desired response.                             Adrenergic receptors translate messages from a group of                         neurotransmitter and hormones called catecholamines.  It has been               demonstrated that, by using techniques of genetic engineering,                  one can make small changes in the receptor protein.  This new                   \"engineered\" receptor can now response to the slightly different                catecholester rather than the catecholamine.  In this way one                   can learn what are the critical \"recognition sites\" on the                      receptor and, eventually, what distinguishes the adrenergic                     receptor from other receptors.                                                                                                                                  This research takes advantage of the fact that the beta-                        adrenergic receptor (b-AR) is similar in structure to rhodopsin                 which is the light-sensitive protein in the eye.  Again, by using               genetic engineering, one can alter the b-AR to respond in a way                 similar to the light-sensitive receptor.  Therefore, light                      sensitive probes can be used to analyze the structure of the b-                 AR.  This is a simpler and more effective method of studying the                structure of receptors.  These techniques will provide a better                 means of studying fundamental biological processes and the                      molecular basis of disease.",
