 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two year collaborative project between Gary Maciel                    of Colorado State University and Ye Chaohui of the Wuhan                        Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.  It is                       sponsored jointly by NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.                                                                                                   Research will focus on the continued development and                            application of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), a powerful                   electron.spin/nuclear.spin double.resonance technique that                      enhances the nuclear spin polarization in Nuclear Magnetic                      Resonance (NMR) experiments on materials containing both                        magnetic nuclei and unpaired electrons.  DNP is especially                      important in the characterization of Chinese and U.S. coals                     and diamond.like carbon films prepared in Chinese and U.S.                      laboratories.                                                                                                                                                   For the coal studies, the striking differences between                          magnetic resonance properties measured for U.S. and certain                     Chinese coals will be examined in depth, and structural                         models will be explored for explaining both types of coals                      and these specific differences.  In the diamond film studies,                   the nature of \"defect\" structures will be elucidated and                        related to film properties and preparation methods.  The                        unusual field strength used in the 1.9 T DNP spectrometer in                    the Wuhan Institute of Physics will provide a good opportunity                  for elucidating fundamental details of the DNP phenomenon in                    these samples (via the field dependence of DNP properties)                      and for establishing the optimum magnetic field for DNP                         studies of typical carbonaceous solids.",
