 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two-year collaborative project between Hsien-Kei                      Cheng of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Luo                     Shijun of Northwestern Polytechnic University, Xi'an, China.                    It is sponsored jointly by the NSF and the Northwestern                         Polytechnic University.                                                                                                                                         A combined CFD-asymptotic study is proposed to investigate                      several unresolved, nonlinear aspects and related issues in                     the theory and application of equivalence rules involving                       lift.  Among the topics to be considered are new aspects of                     transonic and supersonic equivalence rules involving a                          nonlinear near field and the use/development of Euler and                       Navier-Stockes solutions via domain decomposition (and                          programming parallelism), with the main objective of                            ascertaining the degree to which shocks and flow in the near                    field can affect the rule's validity/applicability.  Included                   is also a computer-program development for a 3-D transonic                      small-disturbance equation with the specific purpose of                         applying the equivalence rule for predicting shock loss in                      the far field, which is unavailable heretofore.  Among the                      configurations to be analyzed are wind-tunnel test models,                      for which drag and flow-field data are available for                            comparison, as well as oblique, all-wing designs, of which                      the performance gain with a nonlinear near field is most                        apparent.",
