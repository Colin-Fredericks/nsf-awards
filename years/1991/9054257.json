 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-week workshops is designed for engineering facultywishing              to update their mechanics programs and integrate computers into                 them. Week One recognizes the centrality of mechanics to                        engineering by creating opportunities for participants to receive               lectures on pedagogy and new developments in engineering science                related to mechanics. It also provides attendees with up-to-date                instruction on computer programming and emphasizes the integration              of computing as a computational support tool to mechanics based                 courses.  Lectures will be complemented with computer application               and problem-solving sessions. During Week Two, perspectives on                  graduate level mechanics are introduced along with reports on                   current research being conducted in mechanics-related areas.                    Contact will be maintained with participants for a period after the             workshops to distribute interesting mechanics and mechanics-                    related computer applications and problems.//",
