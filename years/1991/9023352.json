 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schumpeter and Galbraith hypothesized that larger firms experience              lower costs and greater returns from R&D and as a consequence would             be expected to perform a disproportionate share of innovative                   activity relative to their size. Numerous studies of the                        relationship between firm size and R&D effort have been conducted.              The findings are that within the modal industry, above a modest                 size threshold, R&D effort does not rise proportionally with firm               size. Having apparently failed to support the Schumpeterian                     hypothesis, however, these stylized facts have been largely                     ignored. Initially assuming that firms exploit their innovations                through their own sales and that growth due to innovation is                    conditioned by current output, this project uses a simple model to              explain these stylized facts. The model is then used to explain                 observed departures from the modal relationships as well. The                   objective is to explain how industry factors - particularly dynamic             factors and appropriability mechanisms within industries --                     condition the relationship between firm size and R&D. Using data                from the Federal Trade Commission's Line of Business Program,                   patent data compiled from Scherer and data from the Levin et al.                survey on technological opportunity and appropriability conditions              in U.S. manufacturing industries, the model is tested to see if the             correctly postulated factors that condition the relationship have               been specified.                                                                                                                                                 The model used in the project provides a distinctive interpretation             of the proportional relationship betweeen R&D effort and firm size              among R&D performers. In the past, proportionality has been widely              interpreted to indicate that there are no particular advantages or              disadvantages of size in R&D. In this model, however, the                       proportional relationship  reflects the link between the expected               returns from R&D and the firm's ex ante output. It suggests that                larger firms will earn greater returns from any given R&D effort                than smaller firms, implying an advantage of size and R&D. Thus,                the stylized fact that led to the rejection of the Schumpeterian                hypothesis, namely the proportional relationship between R&D effort             and firm size, may actually reveal an advantage of size. An                     important implication of the argument is that the returns to                    innovation are an increasing function of firm size, implying an                 advantage to firm size in R&D.",
