 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although powerful tools for numerical, statistical, and symbolic                computation are readily available, there has not emerged a                      comprehensive and widely used environment for combinatorial computing           of comparable influence.  The goal of this project is to meet this              need.                                                                                                                                                           The system Combinatorica was developed as a combinatorial computing             environment, comprising over 230 functions for manipulating graphs and          other combinatorial objects such as permutations, partitions, and               Young tableaux.  Combinatorica has already been applied to research in          algorithms, biology, graph theory, number theory and engineering, as            well as education.  However, it is but a prototype for the ultimate             combinatorial computing environment.                                                                                                                            Three significant research issures will be addressed which are                  fundamental to the development of future combinatorial computing                environments.  First, a method will be investigated to effectively              compute NP-complete graph invariants through graph recognition and              inversion, by identifying special classes graphs for which there exist          efficient algorithms.  Second, efficient combinatorial search                   techniques will be developed for sub-graph isomorphism, graph minors,           and graph homeomorphism - fundamental primitives which have not been            implemented in full generality in any existing combinatorial computing          environment.  Finally, graph algorithms will be developed for                   applicative or write-once machines, which experience shows to be a              more accurate computational model for term-rewriting systems than               random access machines.                                                                                                                                         These algorithms will form the heart of the proposed next version of            Combinatorica to be written in C++ and X-windows and comprising both a          workbench and library for combinatorial computing.",
