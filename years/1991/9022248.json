 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Stanford                        University supports interactive and interdisciplinary materials                 research in three primary thrust areas.                                              Researchers in the polymers thrust are studying polymer                    structure and dynamics using optical techniques; emphasis is                    being placed on increasingly complex materials, and an expert in                chemical synthesis has joined the group.  The thrust program on                 superconducting materials focuses on the preparation of                         high-temperature superconducting materials in a variety of ways                 and on understanding the behavior of these materials.                           Researchers in the surface structure and reactivity group, in a                 collaborative effort with IBM Almaden, are investigating the                    structure, mobility and reactivity of adsorbates on surfaces,                   using spectroscopic techniques with a strong emphasis on                        synchrotron radiation.                                                               The Stanford MRL places a strong emphasis on the                           development, operation and maintenance of major central research                facilities in materials preparation and characterization.  It                   also provides seed funding for exploratory research; supports                   initiatives to broaden the participation of women and minorities                in materials research; and fosters research participation by                    undergraduates.  The program currently involves 26 faculty                      members and senior personnel from eight academic departments, 3                 postdoctoral research associates, 50 graduate students and 13                   undergraduates, and supporting scientific and clerical staff.                   The Stanford MRL is directed by Professor Stig B. Hagstrom.",
