 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is for continued support of a field experiment                      designed to investigate the performance of buried pipelines                     when subjected to the ground shaking induced by a large                         earthquake; specifically the lateral offsets and ground strains                 induced by seismic wave propagation.  This experiment has                       been constructed at Owens' Pasture, near Parkfield,                             California.                                                                                                                                                     This site was chosen so as to capitalize on the predicted                       recurrence of the 1966 Parkfield-Cholame earthquake                             sequence on the San Andreas fault.  Although this                               earthquake has not yet occurred, transient and residual                         strains in the instrumented pipe segments were measured                         during the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.  The                        distribution of strains in the pipes and their correlation with                 ground movements yields important insights into the                             behavior of girth-welded steel pipelines of the type used for                   oil, gas and water transmission.                                                                                                                                Data from the Loma Prieta earthquake and from the main                          Parkfield event yet to occur make it possible to evaluate                       critical assumptions of analytical models and, if necessary,                    revise them.  One objective of this experiment is to evaluate                   current analytical models in light of the low amplitude data                    collected at Parkfield during the Loma Prieta earthquake.                       The measurements made during this earthquake indicate                           that when the predicted earthquake at Parkfield occurs,                         valuable data will be obtained from this event.  This leads to                  the second goal, which is to maintain the experiment                            through 1993 in anticipation of this predicted event                            occurring.  This is but one of many experiments at Parkfield,                   supported by federal and state agencies and non-profit                          institutions, which were installed and are being maintained in                  anticipation of the predicted earthquake occurring.",
