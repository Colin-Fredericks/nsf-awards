 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Stanford University for the renovation and repair of the Stauffer               building complex which houses a portion of the research and                     research training activities in Chemistry and Chemical                          Engineering.  This building was constructed in 1961 and last                    renovated in 1989.  The ARFMP grant of $1,500,000 and $4,375,000                provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize               these research and research training facilities so as to meet the               significant new demands placed on them by research in these fields              and the requirements for the safe practice of that research.  This              project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure by systematically upgrading major building systems               and by selectively renovating individual laboratories to conform to             recent building and fire codes.  Top priority will be given to the              renovation of the intake/exhaust systems including the replacement              of all existing fume hoods for safety, economic, and research                   quality considerations.                                                                                                                                         This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                   graduate students.  This project will enable two leading research               and research training departments to continue to provide not only               an outstanding environment but one with an increased capacity for               training the excellent students it attracts.  Students trained in               these laboratories are in demand in both basic and applied                      research fields.",
