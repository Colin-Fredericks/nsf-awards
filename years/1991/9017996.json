 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with the construction of a new soft                  x-ray (SX) emission spectrometer and SX spectroscopy end station                associated with an undulator beamline at the Advanced Light Source              (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.  The undulator and high                  performance spherical grating monochromator will provide 40 times               greater photon fluxed and 200 times higher brightness that will be              used to enhance the intensity and/or resolution of the exciting                 radiation.  The spectrometer and end station will greatly extend                the present spectral range measured in emission, allow measurement              of emission both perpendicular and parallel to the polarization                 direction of the exciting beam, allow measurement of both                       absorption and emission spectra, greatly enhance in-situ sample                 preparation and characterization facilities, and permit joint SX                spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy studies with other users of              the beamline.  The construction project involves scientists at the              University of Tennessee, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and NIST.                This group will jointly operate this undulator beamline at the ALS              with an IBM group from both Almaden and Yorktown.",
