Specifically, the departments of                       Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science,                      Electrical Engineering and Material Sciences are participating                  in this course development proposal.  Furthermore, these                        engineering departments are planning to coordinate teaching                     methods and computer equipment with the Departments of Physics                  and Mathematics in the College of Science, who are making                       similar upgrades of their undergraduate teaching.  A basic                      course in Computer Science is taken by all of the students at                   the outset.Next, each of the engineering departments are making                 coordinated curriculum developments which best suits their                      purpose.",
