 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support cooperative research between Dr.                        Peter Crane of the Field Museum of Natural History and                          Dr.Andrew Drinnan of the University of Melbourne. The                           flowering plants comprise the largest group of plants,                          Angiospermae with approximately 500,000 species.  In                            addition to their sheer diversity, the angiosperms are                          of great economic importance to humans. Angiosperms are                         also major elements of many or most terrestrial                                 ecosystems. Understandably, botanists have been interested                      in developing models and inferences concerning the                              origin and radiation of this highly significant group.                          Within the past two decades, techniques such as molecular                       systematics have become available to permit rigorous                            scientific inquiry into the problem of the origin of the                        flowering plants and phylogenetic models of the group.                          The focus of this research is a detailed study of floral                        development and morphology in the angiosperm family                             Buxaceae to clarify homologies and resolve generic level                        relationships. Utilizing developmental information and                          other data, the project will critically assess contrasting                      hypotheses on the phylogenetic position of the Buxaceae.                        In addition, the broader implications for angiosperm                            phylogeny of incorporating the Buxaceae within, or close                        to, the Trochodendrales will be assessed.  Because the                          Trochodendrales occupy a central position in angiosperm                         phylogeny, the results will have important consequences                         for resolving interrelationships among major groups of                          flowering plants.                                                                                                                                               The project represents excellent collaboration between                          the Australian and the U.S. scientist in combining their                        joint knowledge of the taxa to be considered and the                            techniques to be employed. Their complementary expertise                        on critical developmental, morphological and phylogenetic                       issues of flowing plants has the potential to signifi-                          cantly advance knowledge of the origin of flowering                             plants and phylogenetic models of the group. This is                            also important fundamental work on interrelationships                           among major groups of flowering plants, and has the                             potential to stimulate additional research using new                            molecular approaches to these problems.",
