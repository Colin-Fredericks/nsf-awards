 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational simulations and research will be conducted on                     strongly correlated electronic systems.  Examples of these systems              include high temperature superconductors, heavy Fermion materials               and magnetic materials.  Quantum Monte Carlo techniques will be                 combined with methods of statistical inference to allow us to                   simulate the dynamical response of these systems.  In addition,                 methods which combine quantum Monte Carlo and analytical techniques             will be employed.  One objective of the research is to calculate                experimentally and theoretically relevant properties of model                   systems more accurately than heretofore possible.  Another                      objective is to explore the non-perturbative regions of these                   models in order to predict new physical phenomena.                              %%%                                                                             Strongly correlated many-body systems such as high temperature                  superconductors and magnetic metals are not amenable to the usual               theoretical techniques such as perturbation theory.  Consequently,              because of the absence of analytical methods computational                      simulations become increasingly important to understand the physics             involved with these systems.  This grant will conduct simulations               using a variety of techniques in order to assess the techniques and             to gain insight into the underlying physics for sample strongly                 correlated systems.",
