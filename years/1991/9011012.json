 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important sensory appendage for insects is the flagellum                     of the antenna, containing thousands of receptors called                        sensilla that have been classified into types, including some                   specialized for chemosensory functions.  The nerve from the                     flagellum contains many nerve fibers, or axons, which form                      particular groupings when they enter the brain and terminate in                 distinctive structures called glomeruli.  Each glomerulus is a                  sphere-like complex in which nerve cells make functional                        contacts called synapses, where interactions occur between                      incoming and outgoing information, modulated by local nerve                     cells.  The glomerular structure in insects has several                         similarities to the glomerulus also found in the vertebrate                     olfactory bulb, and it is believed that this structure forms an                 information processing module for synaptic interactions.                                                                                                        This work will focus on how olfactory information is mapped                     in the glomeruli, to see whether in insects olfactory receptors                 are represented in different glomeruli according to their                       functional tuning, their antennal location, or both.  Light                     microscopy and electron microscopy will be used to clarify the                  architecture underlying the connections between neurons that                    provide input and output, and the convergence and local                         circuits that process olfactory information.  The insect system                 offers an advantageous model because it is possible find                        uniquely identifiable single neurons in the brain.  Results                     from this work will be valuable to understanding information                    processing in general, to chemosensory neuroscience in the                      vertebrates as well as invertebrates, to studies on insects as                  model systems during neural development of highly specific                      neural connections, and to agriculturally related studies of                    insect feeding or reproduction which have chemosensory                          components.",
