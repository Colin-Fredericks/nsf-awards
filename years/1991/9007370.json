 "awd_abstract_narration": "A class of massively parallel computers has been introduced over                the last several years in research projects and as commercial                   products.  The computers, designated as Single Instruction Stream               Multiple Data Stream (SIMD), offer an increase in performance and               a significant improvement in cost/performance.  Applications that               can exploit this high degree of parallelism can enjoy the economic              benefits of this cost/performance breakthrough.  The majority of                initial applications on these machines is in the hard sciences and              engineering fields.  However, our Phase I results showed that these             machines can be used for fast and efficient implementations of                  relational and post-relational database technology.  We are working             with a leading SIMD computer manufacturer, MasPar Computer Corp.,               to integrate our Phase I results into a complete database solution.             Phase II tasks will focus on implementation of a complete and                   demonstrable prototype.  The same cost/performance metrics that                 will make this product a strong competitor in the commercial                    database market will lead to the next generation of database                    technology that will allow for storage of complex data objects.                 This post-relational database model will allow for object-oriented              database implementation in diverse fields such as CAD/CAM systems,              genetic mapping, and image analysis applications.",
