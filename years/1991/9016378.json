 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on linear algebra                      between Terry Loring of the University of New Mexico and Ruy                    Exel of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.  Approximately                   finite-dimensional (AF) algebras are C*-algebras which are                      the inductive limits of algebras of matrices.  Since the                        dimension of these matrices can grow arbitrarily fast in the                    inductive system, many of the results from linear algebra are                   not useful, at least in the context of AF algebras, because                     of the dependence on dimension.  This research will attempt                     to develop new invariants of more general collections of                        matrices that almost satisfy a set of relations, especially                     invariants that will have an impact on research in C*-algebras.                                                                                                 The most important rationale for this proposed collaboration                    is the complementary expertise of the applicants.  The                          project will combine Exel's expertise in generalized                            determinants, and together with Loring's expertise in AF                        algebras and related issues in operator theory.  Their                          combined expertise has led them to obtain some interesting                      invariants for the case of almost commuting matrices.",
