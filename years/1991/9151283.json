 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary: The modern biology curriculum should acquaint                  students with concepts and methodologies derived from cellular                  and molecular biology. Currently at Saddleback College,                         students have the opportunity to explore prokaryotic and                        eukaryotic cell structure using standard compound and                           dissecting microscopes, as well as viewing cell structures                      using scanning and transmission electron microscopes. We would                  like to augment the teaching of cell structure and function                     through the fractionation and analysis of cells using                           centrifugation, protein gel electrophoresis, nucleic acid gel                   electrophoresis, and ultraviolet spectroscopy. This equipment                   will allow us to isolate cellular organelles and macromolecules                 in our cell biology, microbiology and introductory biology                      laboratory courses, and to perform simple exercises in                          recombinant DNA technology. With the purchase of a refrigerated                 high speed centrifuge, tabletop mini-centrifuges, protein and                   nucleic acid electrophoresis gel boxes, electrophoresis power                   supplies, and ultraviolet spectrophotometer attachments, we                     feel that we will strengthen and update our laboratory                          curriculum in cell biology and microbiology. Since many of the                  students in cell biology and microbiology courses transfer to                   four year colleges and universities to complete their                           baccalaureate degrees, their exposure to the techniques of                      modern cellular and molecular biology will enhance their future                 for academic success, particularly for those students who                       transfer to research-oriented universities. Furthermore, we                     plan to introduce some aspects of these techniques to                           introductory general biology courses and non-majors biology                     courses in an effort to increase the scientific literacy of                     these students in the areas of modern molecular biology.",
