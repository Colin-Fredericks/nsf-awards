 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Oscillation (SO) and the equatorial quasi-                    biennial oscillation (QBO) are related to significant interannual               variability in the extratropical winter troposphere and                         especially, stratosphere.  This research will examine the                       relative roles of the QBO and SO in crating winter-season climate               anomalies on interannual timescales.  A \"deep\" 26-level climate                 version of the NCAR general circulation model (Community climate                Model) will be used to examine the trosphere-stratosphere system                with the object of providing a unified view of interannual                      wintertime climate variability and its relation to the SO or QBO.               The SO and QBO are viewed as interannually varying external                     forcing agents for the extratropical winter hemisphere.  Since                  winter-season interannual variability is grater in the                          stratosphere than the troposphere, the research will concentrate                on the stratospheric climate anomalies.  By using a general                     circulation model, it is intended to isolate mechanisms capable                 of communicating the tropical forcing anomalies, SO or QBO, to                  the extratropical winter atmosphere, and two such mechanisms are                proposed.  Separate winter season integrations under opposite                   extremes of the SO or QBO will be performed to determine the                    atmospheric responses to the SO and QBO.  Such information is                   especially important in the stratosphere where it has not been                  possible to distinguish clearly between the effects of the SO and               the QBO in the observational climate record.",
