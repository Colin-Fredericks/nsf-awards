 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Bulgaria cooperative                         research project between Dr. Robert Begg of the Indiana                         University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Boian Koulov of Sofia                        University is to study the impact of current changes in                         Bulgarian national policies on the regional organization                        of manufacturing.  Efforts will focus largely on a case                         study of the Burgas region of Bulgaria chosen because it                        is the fastest developing region and the site of a                              massive petro-chemical complex with manufacturing heavily                       concentrated around the city of Burgas.  The researchers                        intend to examine the effects of the decentralization of                        administrative and economic decision-making on the                              territorial organization of manufacturing as Bulgaria                           moves away from a centrally planned economy toward a                            market-oriented economy.  In order to understand the                            changing pattern of production and the causes, the                              researchers will:  establish the historical context and                         baseline data, identify and analyze national policy                             instruments, and undertake fieldwork in the Burgas                              region.  Results should help chart the socioeconomic                            impact of new national policies on local economic                               planning, decision-making at the plant level, firm                              start-ups and plant failures.                                                                                                                                   This project in geography and regional science fulfills                         the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge                         by enabling leading researchers in the United States and                        Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                        research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                       competence.",
