 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues development of a data management strategy                to organize scientific datasets into online (i.e. \"in memory\")                  object-oriented numerical databases.  The strategy uses hashing                 maps based on the spatio-temporal coordinates of the dataset                    itself and addresses a key issue in interactive data analysis -                 maintaining a retrieval route for the user between the visual                   representation on the screen and the actual data.  This is                      accomplished through a set of data structures that manage                       computed data as \"computational objects\" at the nodes of a mesh                 organized as a single plane,  a volume of planes, or a                          timeseries.  All  references to the data are resolved into                      queries about the maps.  The hashing maps can be resident in a                  workstation while managing a database that is itself distributed                across numerous facilities.  Current extensions of this research                include: (1) design of parallel storage and searching techniques                of the distributed data objects; (2) interactive user                           specification of filter functions (local or non-local) for                      graphics and diagnostics; and (3) generalization of management                  utilities to support conversion of any user specified data set to               object-oriented database organization.  This research seeks to                  alleviate the continuing user problem of \"data glut\" in science                 and engineering.  Equally important are its implications for the                development of software strategies that can utilize the complex                 and diverse hardware developments promised for the next decade in               massively parallel computing.",
