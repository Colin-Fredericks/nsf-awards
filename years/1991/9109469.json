 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current software development environments tend to lie at opposite ends          of a spectrum:  at one extreme are specialized application generators;          at the other are general purpose programming environments.  The former          provide strong support for system development and reuse, but are                costly to build and available only for limited domains.  The latter             provide weak support, but are generally available and universally               applicable.  This research explores a way to automate the production            of application-specific environments that lie between these two                 extremes.                                                                       The key idea is that a software framework encapsulating the                     commonalities in a family of systems can be incorporated into an                existing general purpose programming environment by a process of                structured transformation.  Specifically, this project is to develop a          system that allows an environment implementor to specialize existing            programming environments to handle families of applications.  The               system provides a set of formal operators for augmenting a formal               description of an environment; as operators are applied, the system             semi-automatically builds a set of transformation rules that can be             used to translate application-specific programs into those of the               original environment.  The output of the system is an application-              specific environment together with a program transformer that provides          execution semantics for programs written in that environment.",
