 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shared memory is a fundamentally important abstraction in parallel              systems.  Providing a shared memory abstraction across distributed              hardware may prove equally important because it allows processes to             access local and remote information uniformly.  However, implementing           consistent shared memory in a distributed environment is not only               costly but also has fundamental problems of latency and scale.  The             results of recent research suggest that the principled weakening of             memory consistency can reduce the cost of consistency maintenance               while maintaining a viable model for programming.  This project will            investigate both theoretical and practical issues arising from the              study of weakly consistent memories.  The theoretical work will                 include a formal characterization of both existing and new memories             and an investigation of properties of programs that execute correctly           when memory consistency is weakened.  The results of this research              will enhance our fundamental understanding of weak memories.  To                demonstrate that weak memories can be easily programmed and lead to             improved performance, the practical work will investigate programming           and implementation of weakly consistent memories.  Programmers of               weakly consistent memories may write programs \"directly\" for the                weekly consistent model, or programs written for traditional                    consistent memory may be transformed to run more efficiently on a               weakly consistent memory.  The project will identify application                domains suitable for weak memories, develop idioms that simplify the            programming of these memories, and develop efficient distributed                implementations of weakly consistent memories.  Since an application            may be programmed differently on consistent and weak memories, overall          performance depends both on the algorithmic efficiency of the                   application and the performance of the underlying weak memory                   implementation.  Therefore, the work includes experimental research to          study the overall performance of a prototype system using measures              such as execution speedup and message overhead.  Comprehensive                  investigation of the theory and practice of weakly consistent memories          will yield substantial benefits applicable to both distributed systems          and large scale multiprocessors.",
