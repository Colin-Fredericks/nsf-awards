 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Wisconsin-La Crosse for the repair and renovation of              Cowley Hall which houses research and research training in aquatic              studies.  This building was constructed in 1965 and last renovated              in 1974.  The ARFMP grant of $120,000 and $128,400 provided by the              grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research                and research training facilities and thereby enhance the Department             of Biology and Microbiology's comprehensive aquatic research and                research training program which has substantially expanded its                  capabilities in the areas of aquatic toxicology and chemistry in                the last decade.  This project will address the need to improve the             current research infrastructure by (a) upgrading existing                       ventilation, heating and air conditioning (HVAC), (b) modifying                 existing electrical and plumbing systems, and (c) adding or                     replacing laboratory benches, fume hoods, sinks, water conditioning             units, and other  laboratory fixtures in order to improve the                   utility and safety of existing facilities.                                                                                                                      This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate students.  Students                   trained in these laboratories are well prepared to enter graduate               programs or to directly enter the work force to help meet the great             regional and national demand for professionals with formal training             in aquatic toxicology and chemistry.",
