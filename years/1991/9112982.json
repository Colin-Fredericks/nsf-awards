 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attitudes toward racial minorities can have powerful effects on the             voting behavior of Americans.  This is true even in the great                   majority of campaigns where candidates avoid explicit references                to race or direct appeals to racial attitudes.  This doctoral                   dissertation research explores the psychological processes through              which race can influence the voters' evaluations of candidates in               the absence of explicit racial messages.                                                                                                                        Specifically this study draws upon theories from cognitive                      psychology to develop and test a psychologically realistic model                both of the process by which voters draw inferences about the                   racial positions of candidates and of the effects these inferences              have on support for candidates.  A series of laboratory experiments             involving fictitious candidates and campaigns will be conducted in              which the effects of various campaign slogans are assessed.                                                                                                     When completed this study will increase our understanding of the                continuing effects of race on political attitudes and behavior in               the United States.",
