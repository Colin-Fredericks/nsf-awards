 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the heat energy that drives and shapes atmospheric                 circulation patterns comes from the sun via the underlying                      surface of the atmosphere. Thermal contrasts on the surface are                 generated, e.g., by continent-ocean and pole-equator differences                on the large scale. The Tibetan Plateau in the summer-time can                  function as an \"elevated hot-plate\", reinforcing the thermal                    contrast provided by the massive Eurasian continent and its                     surrounding oceans. It is conceivable that this reinforcement                   explains the occurence of the much more pronounced seasonal                     reversal of circulation over South Asia than over other regions.                Bannon proposes to use a set of developing theoretical tools to                 explore this possibility. His proposed parallel study will use                  variations of these tools to analyze the role of  the underlying                surface in the reinforcement or elimination of strong temperature               contrasts already present in its overlying (traveling or                        stationary) air masses. A successful analysis of this process                   will help reduce the frequency of a particularly vexing set of                  weather forecasting errors, in which frontal passages occur when                they were forecasted, but their associated precipitation                        patterns, wind conditions, and temperature changes are either                   much weaker or stronger than forecast.                                               Bannon's previous work has both built and applied the tools                to be used in problems of this type.",
