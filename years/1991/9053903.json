 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Engineering at the University of California,                Davis, in cooperation with the Sacramento Valley Section of                     the Society of Women Engineers, is developing, testing,                         evaluating and refining activities to increase the rate of                      perseverance of female undergraduate students in engineering.                   The project builds on the College's significant number of                       women students and faculty members; its professional staff                      members who have extensive experience in establishing                           successful programs in engineering and the well-established                     campus networks for women in math and science. It addresses                     the following factors identified by women students, faculty                     and professional engineers that negatively affect the                           persistence of women in engineering: isolation, an inability                    to see the relevance of highly theoretical basic courses,                       negative experiences in laboratory courses, the \"cold\"                          classroom climate and the lack of role models. Evaluation                       will be done in cooperation with the campus Women's Resource                    and Research Center. Activities include: \"Brown Bag Lunches                     for Women in Engineering\" to address the isolation                              experienced by freshman and sophomore engineering students;                     \"Shadowing Women Engineers at Work\" to counter the negative                     effects of the highly theoretical courses in the freshman and                   sophomore years; a new course, \"How Things Work\" to overcome                    deficiencies resulting from women students' lack of                             socialization in how things work and in how male culture                        works; \"Enhancing the Classroom Climate\", a faculty workshop                    for male engineering faculty to sensitize them to the                           \"chilling\" dynamics of engineering classrooms; and,                             Undergraduate Research, a continuing effort to help women                       engineering students realize how what they have learned                         applies in \"real engineering and to encourage them to use                       their abilities in graduate study. Activities are designed so                   that, once tested and refined, they can easily be replicated                    on other university campuses.                                                   Measurable Objectives to determine the effectiveness of the                     project include:                                                                                                                                                     o The persistence and graduation rates of women                                   participants will be compared with the persistence and                          graduation rates of women who did not participate in                            any component of the project.",
