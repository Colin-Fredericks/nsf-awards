Fox                 under the National Science Foundation's Presidential Young                      Investigator Awards Program.                                                                                                                                    Flow reactors are used for both fundamental kinetic studies and                 industrial chemical manufacturing.  Dynamic modelling for process               control and kinetic studies of flow reactors have involved lumped               models consisting of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential                    equations.  In formulating these models, it is assumed that the                 transport processes occur at time scales much shorter than those                of the chemical kinetics.  Experimentally it has been assumed that,             with the stirring rate sufficiently high, the dynamical behavior                depends only on the chemical kinetics.  In fact, bistabilities and              time-dependent behavior can be strongly influenced by the premixing             configuration and the stirring rate, even when the latter is                    relatively fast compared to the residence time.                                 The PI's research is in the area of studying the effect of mixing               on the dynamical behavior of flow reactors.  Specifically, detailed             experimental and analytical investigation is planned of the mixing              effects in chemical oscillators with the dual goals of                          understanding the interplay between transport and chemical                      reactions and of developing accurate mixing models for systems                  involving multiple reaction steps.  Another area to be looked at                will be the mathematical simulation of turbulent reactive flows in              flow reactors.  The PI plans to use the probability density                     function method using Fokker-Planck closure based on diffusion in               the lamellar structures generated by the chaotic flow field.  He                plans to look at the effects of reaction terms for nonpremixed feed             flows.",
