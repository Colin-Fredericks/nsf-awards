 "awd_abstract_narration": "Misfit dislocations are thermodynamically stable in epitaxial films             above a critical thickness, which depends mainly on the misfit                  magnitude between the film and substrate.  The formation of                     dislocations does not occur immediately when the critical thickness             is exceeded since kinetic factors are involved which are not                    adequately understood.  This grant examines the role of misfit                  dislocations and strain in affecting behavior of magnetic films.                The kinetics of dislocation nucleation in epitaxial thin films is               pursued with an aim towards developing an in-situ method for                    monitoring misfit dislocation formation.  The Magneto-optic Kerr                (MOKE) effect is employed as a probe that is sensitive to the                   presence of small strains in magnetic films.  This is used to                   characterize misfit strains and dislocations on epitaxial                       nickel/copper films.  Other techniques employed are electron                    microscopy and secondary electron spin polarization analysis to                 determine the kinetics of dislocation formation.                                %%%                                                                             The homogeneous strain of lattice mismatch and the highly non-                  uniform strains around dislocations have dramatic effects on                    magnetic properties.  This research is directed towards developing              a better understanding of the formation of misfit dislocations and              their effects on magnetic films.  An in-situ monitoring technique               during film growth could result from the research.",
