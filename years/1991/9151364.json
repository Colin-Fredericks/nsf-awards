 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department is developing several chemistry                        courses to attract non-majors including a popular one with a                    forensic science perspective.  A laboratory experience                          accompanies each of these courses so that non-majors experience                 the type of thinking that a laboratory experience brings.                       Modern instrumentation is a part of this laboratory experience                  including computer control of instruments with data handling                    and manipulation by computer.A spectrofluorometer is being used                 in several courses, but especially the forensic science course                  for non-majors.  Students are determining fluorescent spectra                   of motor oils and magic markers and comparing the spectra                       obtained by other students to determine whether oils and                        markers can be distinguished by their spectra.  Students are                    getting experience with manipulation and comparison of the                      spectra by computer software.  The fluorometer is being used in                 courses for majors as well.",
