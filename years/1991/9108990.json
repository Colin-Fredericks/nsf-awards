 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Salamanca Riba will investigate various topics in                the theory of unitary representations of reductive Lie groups.                  Firstly, she will attempt to complete a proof of a conjecture of                Zuckerman that certain Harish-Chandra modules are isomorphic to                 Zuckerman functor modules.  In addition she will consider other                 generalizations of the above conjecture. For example, in certain                cases Barbasch and Vogan have conjectured that these derived                    functor modules are obtained from a special unipotent                           representation.  Professor Salamanca Riba will attempt to prove                 this.                                                                                The research project being described here is in group                      representation theory.  Groups usually arise as transformations                 which preserve the structure of a system under investigation, as                for example the group of rotations around the center preserves a                sphere.  In specific applications a concrete realization of the                 abstract group, or representation, is often needed.  These are the              objects which are being studied here.",
