 "awd_abstract_narration": "As with other facets of economic activity, spatial patterns of               innovation and technological development have changed substantially in          recent decades.  New forms of developmental activity within individual          firms and among groups of firms include joint ventures, licensing               agreements, and research and development consortiums.  Research on these        trends has been long on theory and anecdotal evidence but short on              systematic empirical analysis.  This project will focus on two central          questions:  How have geographic patterns of industrial innovation and           technological development changed as more activities have been conducted        through arrangements outside the framework of individual firms?  How            have communications and other interactions among firms changed in               response to increased externalization of innovation and technological           development?  Answers to these questions will result from information           gathered through detailed surveys of executives in the industrial               chemical, computer, and computer-assisted design and manufacturing              equipment industries.  These data will be analyzed quantitatively and           statistically to determine the degree to which geographic dimensions of         innovation and technological development have changed in recent years.             This project will provide new data about the form and magnitude of           developmental linkages among industrial firms for three different               industries.  Analyses of these data will provide new insights into              changing spatial forms of innovation and technological development, and         they will provide a basis for comparative evaluation of changing                patterns in other industries.",
