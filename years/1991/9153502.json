Demographically, minority students constitute 80% of                 the student body at Dunbar; the students are equally divided by                 sex.  To attain the goal, several strategies are being                          included:  strengthening pre-college science and mathematics                    courses, offering a health-related scientific professions                       orientation course, broadening students' science background by                  discussing new discoveries, field-trips, demonstrations to                      illustrate concepts, giving students hands-on laboratory                        experience so that the \"do science\", workshops for teachers,                    opportunity for summer research for students and teachers under                 the supervision of faculty mentors, encouraging teachers and                    selected students to accompany their mentors to professional                    meetings, and sensitizing faculty about the educational needs                   and \"culture\" of women and minorities.  Since most public high                  schools in large cities have racial demographics similar to                     Dayton's, the project has high potential for replication.",
