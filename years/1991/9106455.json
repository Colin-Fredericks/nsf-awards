 "awd_abstract_narration": "When there is very little migration within a population of                 living organisms, the distance between the birthplaces of                       individuals and the birthplaces of their parents is not much                    greater than the distance between neighbors.  Under these                       conditions different types of genes may become locally more or                  less common than average by purely random chance.  These random                 genetic changes are very different from the nonrandom genetic                   changes brought about by natural selection that lead to adaptive                evolution.  However, random changes in the genetic composition of               local areas within a population can have a great impact on the                  specific evolutionary pathway along which a population is guided                by natural selection.  Therefore, to understand the types of                    evolutionary changes that may be brought about by natural                       selection, the importance of random changes must be determined.                      The investigators will study random genetic changes within                 natural populations of two plant species that are native to the                 tallgrass prairies of North America.  The extent to which                       different local areas within each study population have different               genetic compositions as a result of random changes will be                      measured.  Migration distances of pollen grains and seeds will                  also be measured to see if  the amount of random genetic change                 is consistent with present migration patterns.  The information                 on how genetic variation is distributed among different local                   areas will also be useful in establishing management guidelines                 for the conservation of genetic diversity within the few                        remaining tracts of the once vast tallgrass prairie.",
