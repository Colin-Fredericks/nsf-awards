 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supramolecular assemblies, e.g. monolayers, vesicles, extended                  bilayers, cast bilayers, and tubules, are two-dimensional arrays of             amphiphiles.  The recent introduction of methods to polymerize                  these assemblies provides a means to prepare new materials with                 unusual properties.  The nature of these two-dimensional                        polymerizations and the effect of the assembly structure on the                 polymerization reaction has been poorly understood.  However our                previous research has provided valuable insights into these                     polymerization processes.  The objective of this research is to                 enhance our fledgling understanding of the fundamentals of two-                 dimensional polymerizations.  Specifically, this reserch will                   emphasize the following:  a) the factors that control the size of               linear polymers formed in homolipid and mixed lipid assemblies; and             c) determination of the effect of the frequency of crosslinks in                the polymerization of the assemblies on both the rate of lateral                lipid diffusion, and the appearance of domains in two-dimensions.               These data, to be determined primarily for extended bilayer and                 vesicle assemblies, are expected to provide a basis to evaluate how             two-dimensional polymerizations parallel or deviate from the                    established principles of isotropic polymerizations.                                                                                                            This research combines synthetic chemistry, instrumental                        characterization, and surface science.  It is expected to provide               a rational foundation for the use of two-dimensional                            polymerizations for the formation of new materials, such as                     membranes.",
