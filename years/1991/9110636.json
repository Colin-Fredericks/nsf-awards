 "awd_abstract_narration": "H-infinity theory has been widely accepted for robust                           control system design to cope with the inaccurate                               description of the mathematical models.  However,                               there exist very few identification techniques which are                        compatible with current robust control design                                   methodologies.  The problem of system identification in                         H-infinity is thus formulated to obtain an identified                           system model with explicit upper bound on                                       identification error in H-infinity norm based on                                experimental information (noisy data).  This proposal                           aims to develop control oriented identification                                 techniques in H-infinity framework for linear                                   time-invariant systems.  The proposed research will                             focus on following issues:                                                                                                                                      1.    Establish practical noise models which fit the                                  H-infinity framework;                                                     2.    Investigate the role of linear algorithms in                                    system identification;                                                    3.    Develop robustly convergent                                                     identification algorithms for different                                         noise models with priori upper bounds                                           for identification error in H-infinity                                          norm;                                                                     4.    Optimize the performance of robustly                                            convergent identification algorithms;                                     5.    Study system identification in H-infinity based                                 on experimental noisy time response data.                                                                                                                 The ultimate goal of this proposal is to update                                 identification techniques so that they are compatible                           with modern robust control methodologies.",
