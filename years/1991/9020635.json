 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer equipment will be purchased to enhance the existing               UNIDA TA program within the Atmospheric Science Department at                   Cornell University.  This award will allow the acquisition of a                 powerful UNIX based workstation and a 386 based PC.  This                       equipment will be used primarily for data ingest and analysis.                  The UNIDATA suite of software will provide the Department with                  easy access to station data, satellite images and gridded                       analysis and forecasts from numerical models.  These data are                   used extensively in research and instruction within the                         Department and as input to an interactive access and display                    system, known as CLIMOD (CLimate Information for Management and                 Operational Decisions).  In addition to enhancing the                           Department's capabilities, there is a need to reconfigure                       existing equipment and to acquire new equipment because UNIDATA                 will no longer support or will continue to develop its software                 for the VMS operating system.  The VMS operating system is the                  primary operating system used in the Department today.  Also, an                older PC is being replaced by a faster and more capable PC to                   allow the more effective use of McIDAS which is a UNIDATA                       supported software package.",
