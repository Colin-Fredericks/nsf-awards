 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in chemical process                    control to be conducted by Ahmet Palazoglu of the University                    of California at Davis and Jose Ramagnoli of the Chemical                       Engineering Pilot Plant of CONICET in Bahia Blanca, Argentina.                  The primary object of this collaborative effort is to develop                   design and analysis methods for robust process control                          systems.  With increasing demands on product quality,                           contraints on process economics and stringent environmental                     regulations, automatic control has undeniably become and                        integral pat of chemical process operations.  However,                          reliable under various operating regimes and demand that the                    controllers respond to such variations without loss of                          performance or stability characteristics.  The methods                          developed through this collaboration will be tested on                          various applications.  The U. S. investigators have already                     investigated a high purity distillation column model to                         demonstrate the uncertainty characterization by various                         methods.  The dynamic model of double effect high purity                        column has also been developed and its behavior has been                        tested under multi-loop PI control.  The research team in                       Argentina has studied the singular value and the structured                     singular value concepts in characterizing model uncertainty                     for chemical processes.                                                                                                                                         These two groups have complementary expertise in the area of                    robust control of linear and nonlinear process.  Demonstrated                   by a number of publications, the two linear process.                            Demonstrated by a number of publications, the two groups have                   investigated the use of various representations of the                          model/plant mismatch and arrived at design and analysis                         methods.  The UC Davis group emphasizes the use of mag-                         nitude/phase information as well as its extensions to highly                    structured cases.  In terms of applications, the UC Davis                       group developed rigorous dynamic models of high purity                          distillation systems while the Argentines work with triple                      effect evaporators and fixed-bed reactors, including pilot                      plant studies.  Development of robust control strategies                        ultimately benefits processing industries in both countries                     by assisting them to operate process units with more confidence                 under tight control situations.",
