 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study uses the theory of information transmission over                     communication channels to explain how supply and demand                         information is communicated to the public by market prices.  The                stock market is chosen as a specific example.  Rising and falling               stock prices should signal fundamental changes in the value of                  the underlying stocks.  Excess stock price volatility occurs when               stock prices change but the fundamental stock values do not.  The               theory of information transmission is used to show that such                    false price signals can be detected and thereby discounted by                   market traders.  Successful detection leads to a more efficient                 market and increased social welfare by making the allocation of                 national resources more efficient.  The theoretical market model                proposed is validated using New York Stock Exchange stock price                 and volume data covering the historically most volatile period of               this exchange.  The study is important in understanding the                     general nature of information transmission and content.  In that                regard, this study explores the fundamental characteristics of                  information by using an engineering communications theory to                    analyze information flows in economic markets.",
