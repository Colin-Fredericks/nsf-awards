 "awd_abstract_narration": "A bottleneck can occur when a new population is established                from a few individuals.  Bottlenecks have been invoked as a                     mechanism in the formation of new species because they may                      dramatically modify mating behavior, but the specific effects of                bottlenecks on courtship repertoire have not been tested to                     confirm such a mode of speciation.  Recent studies have shown                   that traditional models are inadequate to predict bottleneck                    effects on genetic aspects of complex traits, such as body size                 and survival.  The proposed study will apply classical                          quantitative genetic techniques currently employed for morphology               (i.e., statistical comparisons of body dimensions of parents and                offspring) to examine the effects of bottlenecks on courtship                   behavior.  Specifically, videotaped courtships of 100 families of               each of twelve strains that have undergone population bottlenecks               and four control lines of the housefly will be assayed for                      genetic variation and covariation of four courtship behaviors.                  These analyses will more clearly establish the efficacy of                      bottlenecks to alter the genetic properties of courtship elements               and the consequent potential of bottlenecks to catalyze                         speciation.  The successful management of endangered species                    critically depends upon such information for more thorough and                  accurate understanding of the effects of small population size on               the genetics of reproductive behavior.",
