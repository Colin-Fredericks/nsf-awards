 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both the United States and the Soviet Union are planning                        large-scale dense plasma research facilities at a cost of                       over $1 billion each.  These facilities will greatly expand                     the range of plasmas that can be produced and will pose a                       number of important questions for fundamental research.  As                     available plasma energies increase, it becomes interesting                      and important for theorists to consider fundamental processes                   that can occur and be measured on the correspondingly greater                   time and length scales and at the higher achievable energy                      densities.  As the only countries now planning such next-                       generation facilities, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. have a                         major joint interest in this field.                                                                                                                             This joint workshop, which is being organized by Dr. Richard                    Morse of the University of Arizona and Dr. Sergey Anisimov of                   the Landau Institute of Theoretical Physics of the Soviet                       Academy of Sciences, will be concerned with the theory of                       such next-generation dense plasmas.  The state of the                           existing theory, and the new theory requirements for                            understanding these plasmas, will be considered.  A central                     purpose of the workshop is to identify promising U.S.-Soviet                    research partnerships in this field and to begin preparation                    of competitive proposals for support of long-term collaborative                 projects.  Because of prior contacts and strong patterns of                     complementarity of approaches and capabilities in the U.S.                      and Soviet plasma theory communities, it is expected that                       joint research in this area would be mutually beneficial.                                                                                                       This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the                     United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary                         efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest                     and competence in the field of basic scientific research on                     the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
