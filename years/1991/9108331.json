The objective is to develop, in the context of a single                         theoretical framework, an explanatory account of certain                        syntactic and semantic phenomena characteristic of this important               linguistic type.  The theoretical framework of the project is a                 combination of the Government and Binding theory and a version of               model-theoretic semantics.  The research on the four languages                  systematically examines the ergative construction in relation to                each of the principal levels of syntactic representation --                     Logical Form, S-structure, and D-structure -- and in relation to                the phenomenon of free word order, characteristic of the                        languages of the project.  While the four languages are                         reasonably representative of their type, the sample is                          restricted, and the project seeks to off-set this by                            incorporating three ancillary activities:  a survey of the                      literature on Mayan ergativity (represented in agreement                        morphology only, rather than case), a semester-long seminar on                  ergativity, and a colloquium series on ergativity.  A book on the               theoretical position of morphologically ergative languages is                   included as an integral part of the project.",
