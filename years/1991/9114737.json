 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to analyze, design,                      construct and test a precision, magnetically-suspended, six                     degrees-of-freedom motion control stage with 1 Angstrom resolution              (0.004 micrometer) in a 100 micrometer cube of accessible travel.               The suspended platen will be floated in oil to support its weight               and provide mechanical damping and high-frequency coupling.                     Advances will be made in sensors, actuators, precision control                  algorithms and mechanical design. The research techniques can be                scaled, in principle, to larger travels and lessor degrees of                   freedom, as necessary from the application perspective.                              This development will enable the enhancement of the                        performance of many nano-precision devices, in applications such                as scanned probe microscopy, X-ray and optical photolithography,                diamond tool machining and probing and analysis of integrated                   circuit devices.  These processes are of considerable utility in                the manufacturing of a variety of devices and products that are                 vital to the economy of the nation.",
