 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecological and genetic theory predict that there should be                 trade-offs between life history traits such as reproductive                     output and lifespan.  Genes that result in greater reproduction                 should also produce shortened life span.  This theory, if                       correct, supports the idea that senescence has a genetic basis                  and that senescence is a consequence of normal processes that                   favor increased reproduction at the expense of shortened                        lifespan.  Furthermore, this theory points a way, in principle,                 to genetic modification of fertility and lifespan.                                   While some experimental observations support this                          expectation of trade-offs, many do not.  The absence of trade-                  offs in a number of experimental studies may be a consequence of                the testing of organisms in environments to which they are not                  adapted, as would be the case when wild-caught organisms are                    brought into the laboratory.  Under this hypothesis, some                       individuals will carry genes that fortuitously are favorable in a               new environment.  Those individuals will be generally more                      vigorous than other individuals that by chance carry genes that                 are not favorable in the new environment.  This situation will                  produce a pattern of positive associations between life history                 traits, rather than a pattern of trade-offs.  However, the                      positive associations should be a transient phenomenon, and as                  populations adapt to their new environment, the expected pattern                of trade-offs should be reestablished.  These experiments will                  test the robustness of basic theories underlying the evolution of               characters such as lifespan, and the predictive value of the                    theory in novel environments, such as would occur during global                 climate change.",
