The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,                  and the use of unique or complimentary facilities, expertise                    and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                             This award for a proposal sponsored by Dr. Robert S. Crosson                    will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by                      Dr. John Calloway VanDecar of the University of Washington                      with Drs. Guust Nolet and Roel Snieder of the University of                     Utrecht.  In order to improve knowledge of the Earth's                          mantle, and in particular the structure of tectonically                         active regions, to better answer fundamental questions about                    tectonic processes, the researchers propose to (A) extract                      from large data sets more accurate parameters and quantitative                  data covariance estimates; (B) apply robust statistical                         techniques to seismic inversion problems to help account for                    non-Gaussian noise distributions and gross errors; (C)                          implement non-linear inversion techniques where necessary;                      and (D) include diverse geophysical data sets (e.g., gravity,                   phase amplitudes) into the seismic inversion problem in order                   to help constrain the uniqueness of resulting models.  They                     also intend to perform detailed resolution analyses with (A -                   D) in place in order to determine what limits the highest                       quality data, combined with appropriate theory, can place on                    small scale earth structure.                                                                                                                                    The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the                      U.S. home institution.",
