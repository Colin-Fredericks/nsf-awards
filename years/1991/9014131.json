 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports four scientists from the Center of Limnology                and Department of Botany of the University of Wisconsin, led by                 Professor Michael S. Adams, to collaborate in several studies                   of mutual interest with Dr. Max Tilzer and others of the                        Institute of Limnology of the University of Konstanz.  The U.S.                 participants are basing their collaboration on their NSF-funded                 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project that focuses on                    the physical, chemical and biological limnology of several                      small lakes in the Northern Highland Lake district of Wisconsin.                The Germans, in contrast, are studying the limnology of a deep,                 large lake in southern Germany, Lake Konstanz (the Bodensee.)                   One topic of emphasis in both large research programs is the                    role of light scattering and absorption by algal and non-algal                  materials in controlling primary productivity (the growth of                    the suspended phytoplanktonic algae.)  The collaborating                        scientists will also compare their different conceptual models                  of primary productivity and their different methods of measuring                it.  Both groups are also involved in long term studies of the                  impact of acid rain on aquatic systems.  They intend to compare                 the insights they have gained.                                                                                                                                  The German project leader is an expert on phytoplankton quantum                 efficiency.  The US methods will be strengthened and benefit                    from accurate interpretations of quantum efficiency.  The US                    team uses a sophisticated laboratory incubation method for                      determining primary productivity that permits great experimental                and analytical flexibility.  The German group uses the older                    \"in situ\" procedures that give accurate field measurements but                  lack experimental flexibility.  The lakes they use for field                    study differ in a number of ways that make for interesting                      comparisons.                                                                                                                                                    The proposed collaboration will enhance understanding of the                    natural variability of aquatic systems, of primary productivity                 methods and models, and of the light climate of lakes.  It will                 also contribute to important on-going research efforts in acid                  deposition.",
