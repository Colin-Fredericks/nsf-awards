 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1 of this project in model theory, algebra and geometry               will continue the development of a theory of p-adic and rigid                   subanalytic sets.  The p-adic theory was begun by Denef and van                 den Dries and the rigid analytic theory was developed by the                    investigator.  These developments are based on various quantifier               elimination theorems.  It is also intended to give new proofs of                theorems in the real case using this method of quantifier                       elimination and to transfer these new proofs also to the p-adic                 and rigid analytic cases.  The investigation of connections with                Artin Approximation Theorems is also contemplated.                                   Section 2 of the project will continue the investigation of                various diophantine problems in the language of addition and                    divisibility for the integers and polynomial rings.  This would                 extend earlier work by the investigator, Denef and Pheidas.                          It is fascinating to see how theorems about algebraic                      objects such as rings of power series can be seriously addressed                by methods drawn from mathematical logic, that is, methods which                deal largely with features of the language in which the theorems                are expressed.  This is not the whole story, but seeing how far                 one can get in this way isolates other obstacles in a highly                    illuminating way.",
