 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for acquisition of an automated mass                           spectrometer system which can carry out nitrogen and carbon                     isotope analyses with a high throughput (about 100 samples per                  day) at moderate precision.  Both sample preparation and analyses               are automated in this system.  This instrument will be located in               a shared-use facility laboratory (Marine Science Institute                      Analytical Laboratory) which has a full-time professional                       supervisor.  This laboratory will maintain and operate the                      instrument on a recharge basis, including operator, at low cost                 to the research projects.  Analyses from this equipment would be                available to researchers at other institutions as well as UCSB,                 as is currently the case with the CHN elemental analyzer in this                facility.  The ability off this instrument to make large numbers                of analyses at low cost opens up the use of stable N and C                      isotopes for tracer studies in a variety of biological systems                  where such studies have either not been pursued previously or                   have been hampered by the high cost of analyses, lack of access                 to facilities for such analyses, or the need for extensive sample               preparation.  The initial applications will be to investigate the               pathways of nitrogen uptake and utilization in symbionts, and to                study N inputs and fluxes in marine and freshwater systems.",
