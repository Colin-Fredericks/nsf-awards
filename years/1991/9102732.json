The                         following sutides will be performed in connection with this                     project: (i) determination of the structures of the mixed                       aggregates of three lithium enolates with lithium perchlorate                   and lithium tetraphenylboride, (ii) NMR studies of dynamic                      processes in mixed aggregates, (iii) studies of the solvation                   of a series of substituted lithium phenolates, (iv)                             comprehen-sive analysis of the initial rates of C- and                          O-alkylation of lithioisobutyrophenone and lithio                               2-isopropyl-alpha-tetralone by methyl tosylate in a variety of                  solvents with added lithium perchlorate and lithium                             tetraphenylboride, (v) studies of degenerate proton transfer                    with lithium phenolates, and (vi) design of enantioselective                    organolithium reagents.                                                         %%%                                                                             Organolithium compounds provide the synthetic organic chemist                   with some of the most effective methods for controlling stereo-                 and regiochemistry in processes that involve formation of new                   carbon-carbon bonds. In the past, progress in this field has                    been severely hampered by lack of mechanistic understanding,                    which in turn is a consequence of lack of detailed knowledge of                 the precise structures that organolithium species adopt in                      solution. The proposed studies address the elucidation of                       solution structures and then seek to develop useful mechanistic                 concepts that are based upon these structures. The special                      effects of solvents and cosolvents upon the solution structure                  of organolithium species will be studied. In addition, new                      stereoselctive reagents that are based upon mixed aggregate                     formation will be explored.",
