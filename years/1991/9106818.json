 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the major problems currently being addressed by                         molecular biology involve the interactions of proteins and                      nucleic acids.  Viruses provide a convenient means of                           addressing some of these questions.  In particular, viruses                     with their own packaged polymerases provide self-contained                      systems in which the interaction of both enzymatic and                          structural proteins with nucleic acids can be studied in an                     easily purified and isolated form.  Among such viruses, the                     double-stranded RNA viruses are unique in a number of ways.                     The substrate for their transcriptase is an entirely double-                    stranded RNA.  The transcriptase and replicase are located in                   the same polypeptide.  The substrate for packaging and                          replication is then viral plus strand.  They are multi-                         segmented and in some double-stranded RNA viruses, package                      their RNAs in an equimolar ratio in one particle.  Some of                      these viruses replicate semi-conservatively and some                            conservatively.  The Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus is a                        simple version of such viruses, with one essential RNA of                       known sequence, one major capsid polypeptide, only one                          segment of RNA per particle, and only two open reading                          frames, the second ready by frameshifting.  There are                           extensive genetics of virus-host interaction. This is                           therefore a useful model system studying packaging in double-                   stranded RNA virus.  The PI proposes to focus on the                            determination of the optimal viral binding site and its                         relationship to viral interference and packing; and                             identification of the specificity determinants of viral                         binding and packaging.",
