 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigators will analyze                   systems of differential equations whose solutions model several                 types of reactive thermal explosions.  In particular, they will                 study the qualitative properties of solutions of initial-boundary               value problems that describe the evolution of diffusive and                     nondiffusive thermal explosions in finite domains.  The goal of                 this investigation is to predict precisely where and when                       explosions will occur and to study how the solution behaves as the              blow-up time approaches.                                                        Combustion phenomena are common in many aspects of our daily lives;             think of cars, kitchens, heating systems, rocket and missile                    engines.  A large amount of computer power is brought to bear upon              the systems of partial differential equations that describe                     combustion and explosion phenomena, but very often a great deal of              insight can be obtained from a mathematical analysis of the                     governing equations.  For example, in this project the principal                investigators will attempt to predict where and when an explosion               will occur in a confined space by means of a judicious use of                   a'priori estimates and bounding functions.",
