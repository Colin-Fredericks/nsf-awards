 "awd_abstract_narration": "A method suitable for the measurement of heat release rates of                  both large-and small-scale fires has evolved during the past                    decade.  This method, known as oxygen consumption calorimetry,                  has advantages over traditional calorimetric methods, which rely                on the measurement of sensible energy, a difficult task in open                 systems.  Oxygen consumption calorimetry requires only that                     products of combustion be collected and their composition and                   flow rate measured.  This is a significantly easier task, but it                does require sophisticated gas analysis equipment.                                                                                                              The instrumentation requested here will permit the completion of                a small-scale oxygen consumption calorimeter.  This calorimeter,                modeled after the Cone Calorimeter developed at the Center for                  Fire Research of the National Institute of Standards and                        Technology, will permit undergraduate students to perform a wide                range of state-of-the-art fire measurement experiments for both                 laboratory assignments and independent research project.  It will               be possible to demonstrate the factors influencing the dynamics                 of fires within structures and the quantitative methods to                      measure and characterize these factors.",
