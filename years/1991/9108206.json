 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of surface basicity and microporosity of the                        support on the conversion of n-hexane over platinum on                          magnesia catalysts is examined.  Platinum clusters inside the                   channels of basic zeolites catalyze the aromatization of n-                     hexane with high activity and selectivity; recently it has                      been discovered that platinum clusters on a nonzeolitic basic                   oxide possess similar activity and selectivity, throwing into                   question the usual explanations for this property.  In this                     study, the composition of the oxide is varied systematically                    to change both the microporosity and the surface basicity in                    predictable and measurable ways.  Reactivity measurements are                   used to determine the importance of these structural and                        chemical variables on the selectivity of platinum-catalyzed                     aromatization.                                                                                                                                                  This work attempts to redefine the factors responsible for the                  high selectivity observed.  It is already clear that this                       approach should have a broader scope than thought previously,                   but the limits of the scope are unknown.  Applications in                       processing of chemicals and fuels are numerous.",
