 "awd_abstract_narration": "New approaches will be developed for probing interfacial                        compositions of association colloids and vesicles over a wide                   range of surface charge densities and solution compositions.                    Product distributions from dediazoniation of an aggregate bound                 hydrophobic aryl diazonium salt will provide a \"snapshot\" view of               interfacial nucleophile composition. This probe will be used to                 estimate, simultaneously, interfacial concentrations of water, and              counterions, and also alcohol distributions and counterion                      selectivities. The effect of surface charge density on counterion               binding and aggregate size and shape of micelles composed of                    amphoteric surfactants with phospholipid-like head groups will be               determined by NMR, spectrophotometric, and potentiometric methods.              %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research              of Professor Laurence S. Romsted at Rutgers University. Reactive                species (aryl diazonium salts), bound to aggregated molecules                   (colloids  and vesicles), will undergo reaction with solvent and                other molecules at the aggregate-water interface to give a                      \"snapshot\" view of this interface. The effect of surface charge                 density on the aggregate and the shape of the aggregate will be                 determined by employing a variety of instrumental techniques.                   These studies will allow for a better understanding of an                       important biological process where the enzyme phospholipase A2                  binds to phospholipid vesicles (aggregates).",
