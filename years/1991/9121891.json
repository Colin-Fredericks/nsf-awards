S.  To accomplish this, the                  contractor will conduct the 1991 Survey of Doctorate Recipients,                develop a longitudinal file of information (the Doctorate Work                  History File), and prepare a variety of cross-tabulations from the              1991 survey. The survey response rate will be greatly enhanced by               extensive use of Computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI).                      The Foundation is responsible for developing and maintaining               a data base of demographic, educational, and employment information             on scientists and engineers.  This data base, the Scientific and                Technical Personnel Data System, requires input from three survey               series: The National Survey of Natural and Social Scientists and                Engineers, the Survey of Natural and Social Scientist and                       Engineering Graduates, and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients.                  Data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients are frequently used to             determine the status of various aspects of U.S. science and                     engineering , e.g., changes in research and development activities,             and are also used in conjunction with data from the other surveys               for analytical and policy purposes.  Cosponsoring agencies are                  National Endowment for the Humanities, National Institutes of                   Health, Department of Energy, and Nuclear Regulatory Agency.",
