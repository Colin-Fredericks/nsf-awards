 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed project is to enhance undergraduate                 instruction in research methods in psychology.  The project                     will facilitate the demonstration of a wide range of                            psychological phenomena, as well as the design, execution, and                  analysis of original research by undergraduates.  Its impact                    will be on five upper-division advanced laboratory courses                      (Learning, Cognitive Psychology, Sensation and Perception,                      Physiological Psychology, and Animal Behavior), an introductory                 lab course, and a course in research methods.The core of the                    project is a bank of 13 microcomputers to serve as student                      stations for data collection and analysis.  One of the                          computers is to be used for program development, to assist                      students in designing original research.  The software selected                 will allow students to gain first-hand experience with general                  principles of research design, and also with the specific                       techniques associated with particular areas within experimental                 psychology.  This will greatly increase the breadth of research                 experiences to which students can be exposed, and increase the                  variety and sophistication of student-initiated research                        projects (required of all majors) by facilitating instruction                   in all aspects of the research enterprise.",
