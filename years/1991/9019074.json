 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a program of cooperative research and training                  at the Naval Research Laboratory for minority students of the                   Atlanta University Center.  Six undergraduate students will be                  selected to spend two months working in the Center working on                   small research projects for the Bio/Molecular Engineering                       group of the Naval Research Laboratory.  The program will                       first identify areas of research overlap between the                            cooperating institutions.  The students chosen will work                        within these research areas, thus establishing a continuity of                  their summer research with that at their home institutions.                     The Atlantic University Center (AUC) comprises four                             undergraduate institutions (Morehouse, Spelman, Morris Brown                    Colleges, and Clark-Atlanta University) and the Clark-Atlanta                   graduate School and Morehouse School of Medicine.  The AUC is                   the largest center for predominately black higher education in                  the country.  The plan is for up to six students and two                        faculty members to spend 2 summer months working at the Naval                   Research Laboratories on projects of mutual interest to the                     two centers in the area of interfacial engineering.  The major                  focus of research projects at NRL's Center for Bio/Molecular                    Science and Engineering is on the way in which biological                       molecules (particularly lipids) self-assemble into                              microstructures.  Other projects will involve molecular                         modeling, non-linear optical properties of large organic                        molecules, polymeric ferroelectric liquid crystals, and                         fundamental studies of liquid biophysics.  The NRL Center has                   wide experience with summer research projects for                               undergraduate students.",
