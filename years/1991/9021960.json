 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Herbarium of the Field Museum of Natural History                       contains 2.5 million mounted specimens with concentrated coverage               of Central and South American areas, and is the fifth largest                   repository of plant specimens in the western hemisphere.  The                   Herbarium is actively expanding its holdings through the research               and survey activities of its Curators, through exchanges with                   other herbariums, and through donations of private collections.                 Botanists from around the world rely on access to the specimens                 in the Herbarium which are made available to visiting                           investigators and through loans.  The Museum has initiated an                   ambitious plan to construct new collection storage areas for the                Herbarium, and this will relieve crowding in the collection,                    allow currently inaccessible specimens to be processed and made                 available, and provide room for many years of collection growth.                Dr. John Engel, Chairman of the Museum's Botany Department, has                 devised a three-year plan to make all backlogged specimens                      available, and to implement the first phase of transition to the                newly constructed collection area.                                                   Collections of natural history specimens such as the Field                 Museum's Herbarium are critical resources for the study of                      biological diversity on Earth.  Continued growth and improvement                of these resources is essential for current investigations into                 ecology, evolution, global change (among other areas of                         inquiry), and for future generations of researchers.",
