 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Miami               University at Oxford for the renovation and repair of Culler Hall               which houses the atomic-molecular-optical and the condensed                     matter-magnetics research and research training activities of the               Physics Department.  This building was constructed in 1960 and has              not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $725,000                and $964,471 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used               to modernize these research and research training facilities.  This             project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure in terms of health and safety as well as of the                  quality and quantity of research that can be conducted by providing             adequate power, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC),              and lighting and by reconfiguring the space for more efficient use.             The renovation will at the same time create a flexible research                 facility with a subdivision of space easily adaptable to changing               conditions and research interests.                                                                                                                              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate and master's degree                   students in a Physics department with a strong commitment to                    student involvement in research training activities.  This                      renovation will increase the number of students who can be                      accommodated in a program which has won awards for its quality.",
