 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia for the renovation and              repair of two buildings at its Philadelphia headquarters, the                   Research Wing, which houses the Academy's biological research                   collections, and the Main Building, which houses research and                   research training activities in aquatic ecology and systematic and              evolutionary biology.  These buildings were constructed,                        respectively, in 1978 and in 1872.  The newer of the two buildings              has never been renovated and the older one was last renovated in                1980.  The ARFMP grant of $200,000 and $350,900 provided by the                 grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research                and research training facilities.  This project will address the                need to improve the current research infrastructure in terms of                 health and safety as well as of the quality of research that can be             conducted by renovating the ventilation systems in both of the                  buildings.  These renovations will enable the continuation of                   current laboratory research activities; contribute to the                       preservation of the integrity of laboratory experiments and to the              control of adverse effects of air quality, relative humidity, and               temperature on the systematics collections; and permit the                      implementation of new activities involving radioisotopes and                    carcinogens.                                                                                                                                                    This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.                Students trained in these laboratories are in demand in both basic              and applied research fields.  In addition, the project will                     contribute to the Academy of Natural Sciences' efforts directed                 toward human resources pipeline issues which involve working with               pre-college students.",
