 "awd_abstract_narration": "Porites is one of the most diverse and widely- distributed genera               of living corals.  It has dominated, ecologically and geologically,             most tropical reefs since the Eocene (55 Mya).  Porites has been                the primary frame-builder of many reefs; it helps create the                    habitats occupied by innumerable other organisms; and its skeletons             are a major constituent of some of the world's most productive                  Tertiary oil formations.  Porites also contains preserved in its                skeleton some of the most detailed paleoclimatic records available              from shallow tropical seas.                                                     In this study, Porites is used as a model system for investigating              the evolution of long-lived tropical marine organisms within the                context of the major geophysical processes (plate tectonics and                 glacial sea-level fluctuations) that have shaped the world's oceans             during the Cenozoic.  Enzyme electrophoresis and three kinds of                 morphological data will be used to describe at least 80% of Indo-               Pacific and Caribbean species.  The data will be used to: 1.                    estimate ages of species and dates of divergence from common                    ancestors; 2. construct and compare phylogenies based on genetic                and morphological similarities among the species; 3. test                       alternative hypotheses about the times and geological conditions                favoring coral speciation; 4. examine relationships between life                history characteristics, evolutionary rates and probabilities of                speciation.  The study is expected to resolve many chronic                      taxonomic problems within the genus by correlating genetic and                  morphological classifications, to describe previously unknown                   species, and to identify reliable diagnostic characters that can                be used by biologists and geologists working with living and fossil             material.",
