 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association of Physics Teachers, the American                      Institute of Physics and the American Physical Society will                     develop an innovative, year-long physics course suitable for                    students in grades 9 through 12.  The course will consist of                    six thematic units - recreation, transportation,                                communications and information, health and medicine,                            industry, and home - that will revisit a few important                          fundamental physics concepts in a spiral approach applying                      them to new, real-world contexts.  The course will be                           consistent with AAAS 2061 themes, particularly materials and                    energy, and can be taught in one year or spread through four                    years.  The mathematical level of students will be enhanced                     in accordance with the NCTM Standards.  A constructivist                        approach and the use of cooperative grouping strategies will                    be incorporated in the curriculum design.  Students will be                     able to recognize and begin to understand broad unifying                        concepts of physics and technology, to gain an appreciation                     of science as a process to apply the concepts to realistic                      problem-solving and decision making activities, and to                          identify and evaluate personal and societal impacts of                          technology.  The materials will be developed by teams of                        scientists and high school teachers with support from                           cognitive scientists, curriculum experts, and technology                        educators.  Teachers will be provided with knowledge, skills                    and support to make effective use of the materials.",
