 "awd_abstract_narration": "The globalization of science is occurring in                                    parallel with a rapid expansion in the speed and                                sophistication of information and data handling                                 technologies, and their use for scientific purposes.                            Developments in these areas permit the planning and                             execution of large scale scientific programs.  Such                             programs, in turn, frequently require sophisticated                             data handling and processing techniques.  In view of                            the multilateral character of many large scale                                  scientific programs, the handling, processing, and                              transmission of scientific data has a major                                     international enterprise in its own right, one that                             is vital to those large scale programs.                                                                                                                         The Committee on Data for Science and Technology                                (CODATA) is a non governmental, multilateral body,                              affiliated with the International Council of                                    Scientific Unions (ICSU), whose principal objective                             is to facilitate worldwide communication on problems                            related to scientific data.  Like other members of                              the ICSU family, CODATA is comprised of non                                     governmental National Member Organizations.  The                                National Academy of Sciences (NAS) fulfills that                                function in the United States.  In the past, NAS's                              request to support US participation in CODATA has                               been limited to payment of dues, shared jointly by                              NSF, NIST, and DOE.  The NAS, in order to upgrade US                            participation, established a U.S. National Committee                            (USNC) for CODATA similar to those that guide U.S.                              participation in the ICSU unions.  NSF is being                                 asked to pay one-third of the US annual dues for                                CODATA and to provide support for the development of                            recommendations to ICSU concerning access to data                               and its role in the Commission on International                                 Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP).",
