 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Parson is supported by a grant from the Experimental                  Physical Chemistry Program to study reactions of atoms and                      molecules by crossing one molecular beam with another.  The                     products are to be detected by chemiluminescence and                            laser-induced fluorescence so that the energy states in which                   the products are formed can be determined.  These studies will                  map out the elementary steps which make up the chemical                         reaction.                                                                                                                                                       Molecular beam studies of reactions of Group VA atoms,                          clusters, and hydrides with halogens and oxidizers will be                      carried out.  Products will be detected by electronic                           chemiluminescence or laser-induced fluorescence, and the Group                  VA molecular beam composition will be manipulated by a                          combination of thermal, electric discharge, and                                 photodissociation techniques.  The results should be relevant                   to understanding mechanisms in bulk reaction systems.  In                       addition to identifying important elementary steps, single                      collision studies will provide information about the disposal                   of reaction energy in products.  By accessing different                         potential surfaces with variable collision energy, major                        characteristics of those surfaces can be inferred.",
