 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pulsating objects are important to physicists because an analysis               of them gives information about the interior structure of the                   object; this is the principle underlying the study of seismic                   disturbances to determine the Earth's interior structure.                       Astronomers have discovered that the Sun and other classes of stars             undergo many types of \"nonradial pulsations\", and the analysis of               these observations is now responsible for the most rapidly                      developing disciplines of solar physics.  Many white dwarf stars,               which are the most common product of stellar evolution, undergo                 many types of nonradial oscillations as well.  The large number of              pulsation modes in these stars, together with their simple                      \"degenerate\" state (which allows a model to be formulated with very             few physical variables), has moved the study of seismology of white             dwarfs to the forefront of variable star research.  The Principal               Investigator (PI) has used a previous, five-year Presidential Young             Investigator award to help underwrite simultaneous observing of                 white dwarfs of unusual interest by a group of astronomers located              around the globe.  By pooling their observations they are able to               circumvent the severe data-gaps imposed by the Earth's day/night                rotation cycle and conduct observations for several days -- in the              best case over nearly 10 continuous days.  The PI and his                       collaborators have used such extraordinarily long data strings to               detect and identify over 100 independent pulsation modes in the                 white dwarf PG+1159-035.  The identification of these pulsations                has permitted astronomers to estimate the mass of this star to                  within 0.4% (the most accurate determination of a stellar mass                  other than the Sun's), to estimate the star's rotation rate                     including the tilt of the star's rotational axis in the sky, and                to infer the presence of at least three regions of the star with                different chemical compositions.                                                                                                                                The NSF award will support a continuation of international                      observing campaigns on other white dwarfs of special interest.  The             study will emphasis emphasis in particular the details of their                 chemical structure as well as the effect of rotation of the                     excitation of the NRP modes.  Eventually, these studies may also                permit the measurement of the change of some white dwarfs' sizes                with time.  This would allow in turn an accurate estimate of the                cooling rate of these stars as they evolve to \"cold embers\".  Such              cooling rates will permit an estimate of the ages of these stars.               Since these stars are among the oldest stars in the disk of our                 Milky Way Galaxy, these ages will provide strong constraints on the             age of our Galaxy and hence of the Universe.",
