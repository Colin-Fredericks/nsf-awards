 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under an NSF Grant we have developed                                            some of the essential elements of an x-ray                                      lithography technology for replicating sum-                                     100nm features (so called x-ray                                                 nanolithography), including: durable mask                                       membranes; means of patterning with e-beam                                      and focused-ion beam systems; gap control via                                   studs and piezoelectric drives; and a first-                                    stage alignment system.  In addition, we                                        demonstrated that Auger and photoelectrons                                      are not a limiting factor in nanolithography.                                   As a result of this work, x-ray nanolithography                                 has been used in the fabrication of a number                                    of novel quantum-effect devices and                                             structures, and is now considered a key                                         enabling technology for future                                                  nanoelectronics.  Renewal of this grant will                                    enable to further perfect the alignment                                         system, making it capable of sub-100nm                                          alignment; improve the methods of making                                        nanolithography masks, including better e-                                      beam techniques and diamond membranes;                                          study in detail the problem of diffraction from                                 x-ray absorber patterns, including the effect of                                phase shifts; study the feasibility of non-                                     damaging contact.  The result of this research                                  should be a reliable means of replicating                                       complex, large-area patterns having features                                    approaching 10nm.",
