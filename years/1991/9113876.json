 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal award for Research at Undergraduate Institutions is                for continued research on the fractional quantum Hall effect.                   Numerical work is proposed to investigate outstanding problems in               the fractionally quantized Hall effect which is observed in a two-              dimensional electron gas subject to a transverse magnetic field.                The electron layer is formed at the semiconductor interface of a                high quality Gallium-Arsenide heterostructure device.  The recent               availability of very high mobility samples offers a unique                      opportunity to probe strongly correlated systems in the extreme                 quantum mechanical limit, where collective phenomena occur.  In                 addition, the more recent optical measurements of the quantum Hall              states have provided another dimension in experimental probes of                the quantum Hall effect.  The proposed research addresses the                   nature of half-integral and hierarchy states of the fractional                  quantum Hall effect as well as the physical conditions which                    stabilize them.  Additional areas of research include understanding             edge states; the quantum fluid to classical Wigner crystal cross-               over; optical signature of quantum Hall states; and, the                        possibility of fractional quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional              electron-hole fluid.  Also proposed is a finite-size numerical                  study of a model Hamiltonian for which the Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral             spin fluid ground state is exact.  Chiral spin fluids are similar               to quantum Hall states and support fractional statistics (semion)               excitations.                                                                    %%%                                                                             The quantum Hall effect is due to a unique state of matter - a two-             dimensional electron fluid.  The cooperative behavior of electrons              in two-dimensions is markedly different from their behavior in the              more familiar three-dimensions.  The proposed research will use                 numerical and analytical techniques to study a number of properties             of this strange two-dimensional system which are of current                     interest.  Besides providing insight into the underlying physics of             this strange state of matter, the results may also be of interest               in device fabrication and for high temperature superconductivity.",
