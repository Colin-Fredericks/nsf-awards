 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Limpopo Province in southern Africa is a high-grade                    metamorphic belt that represents the exhumed root of a continent-               continent collision zone.  Granite-greenstone terranes of the                   Zimbabwe Province, to the north, and Kaapvaal Province to the                   south, flank the Limpopo Province.  On the Kaapvaal craton, the                 Witwatersrand Supergroup is interpreted as a foreland-basin fill,               representing the sedimentary response to collisional events in the              Limpopo orogeny.  A sedimentary succession of comparable lateral                extent, thickness, and lithology to the Witwatersrand Supergroup                is not present in the Zimbabwe Craton adjacent to the northern                  marginal zone of the Limpopo Province.  Instead, five local and                 lithologically distinct stratigraphic successions of different age              are present in the greenstone belts.  At least four of these                    successions, developed in the lower and upper greenstones, are of               comparable age to the Witwatersrand Supergroup.  The absence of a               Witwatersrand equivalent in Zimbabwe raises several important                   questions regarding the evolution of the southern African Archean               in specific, and Archean tectonics and sedimentation patterns in                general:  1) What are the detailed characteristics of two of the                3.0-2.7 Ga Zimbabwean basins, including source-area composition,                source-area age, source-area location, sediment dispersal patterns,             depositional environments, basin configuration, basin evolution,                and tectonic setting?  2) What was the genetic relationship of the              Zimbabwe sedimentary basins with respect to the evolution of the                Limpopo orogeny?  3) Was the Limpopo orogeny of Pyrenean or                     Himalayan type?                                                                      A multidisciplinary approach, involving detailed field                     mapping, structural analysis, sedimentologic-stratigraphic                      analysis, and geochemistry, will be applied to two of the                       stratigraphic successions to address the above questions.",
