 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Social Ecology at                the University of California, Irvine to establish a Research                    Experiences for Undergraduates SITE in the discipline of social                 ecology.  Undergraduates in this program will be mentored by a                  faculty member in the Program of Social Ecology and will                        participate in a major research project.  Each student                          participant will learn about the research approaches of the other               students and faculty in the program during periodic receptions                  and seminars.  Students will also participate in workshops on the               GRE, application to graduate school, and will be provided with                  tutoring and academic counseling tailored to their individual                   needs.  At the beginning of winter quarter each involved faculty                member will meet with the group to discuss the research area of                 the undergraduate whom he/she will mentor.  Throughout winter and               spring faculty will build a personal mentorship relationship with               their student through the vehicle of the research project.  The                 research activities of the group will focus on recurring social                 and environmental problems related to crime and justice in                      society, social influences on human development over the life                   cycle, and effects of the physical environment on health and                    behavior.  Research techniques are designed to reveal human                     adaption by concentration on the study of events in the natural                 settings in which they occur.  Near the end of spring quarter all               students will present their results to the group.  Finally,                     students will be formally and informally encouraged to continue                 research activities and the mentorship relationship and to pursue               an academic career.",
