 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will define the important cis-acting viral                sequences and the trans-acting host (yeast) genes necessary and                 sufficient for establishing an infection and for in vivo                        replication of the L-A and M1 double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses that             are components of the Killer virus system of yeast.  The term                   \"replication\" here means dsRNA viral replication, with emphasis of              RNA packaging and RNA genome replication.  The specific aims for                the research proposed are as follows: 1) Develop and efficient                  procedure for the transformation of yeast with RNA.  2) Develop                 replicon systems for analyzing the molecular details of infection               and replication.  The replicons will be single stranded (ss) RNA                transcribed in vivo from DNA clones and introduced into yeast by                transformation.  The replicon RNAs are subgenomic RNAs which will               require viral helper functions in trans to replicate.  3) Compare               properties of successful replicons with the properties of natural               L-A and M1 viruses; i.e. dsRNA molecules per virus particle;effect              pm L-A virus number in wild-type yeast strains and strains carrying             superkiller (ski) mutations; compatibility with M1; and host genes              required for replication.  4) Identify the 5' and 3' sequence                   requirements, and sequence context effect for infection,                        replication and translation by manipulating replicon sequences                  through in vivo mutagenesis.  5) Identify host genes required for               replicon replication by isolating yeast mutants that interfere with             replicon replication, and suppressors of those mutants.",
