 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research revolves around the acquisition of a Single                       Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) computer and its applications to              a variety of problems.  The problems include:  parallel group                   algorithms, natural language processing, neural network learning                algorithms, and the scientist's assistant project.  The SIMD                    computer is uniquely suited as both an exploratory platform upon                which to test new algorithms and as a compute server to actually                solve problems that would otherwise require substantial super                   computer resources to solve.                                                                                                                                    The next generation of super computers are likely to be highly                  parallel computers following the Single Instruction, Multiple Data              (SIMD) architecture and/or the Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data              (MIMD) architecture.  In either case, algorithms need to be                     developed and tested for the architectures to see what problems run             best on what architectures.  This can be done in two ways.  The                 first is to pick arbitrary problems and develop algorithms for both             architectures and then compare the results.  The second method is               to look for problem classes that are best solved by a particular                architecture.  The group at Northeastern have chosen the second                 alternative and are looking for SIMD algorithms for problems that               seem to be particularly well suited for that architecture.  Two                 problems in particular are promising areas of research.  The                    parallel group algorithms are intended to solve computationally                 intensive problems that could not easily be solved on a single                  processor architecture.  The scientist's assistant project is a                 sophisticated very large pattern matching application that is                   particularly well suited to the SIMD architecture.",
