 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Michael Barton will               conduct exploratory archaeological research in the Alicante                     region of Eastern Spain.  Evidence indicates that between 6,500                 and 7,500 years ago, a major transformation took place and                      cultivation of domestic crops and the herding of animals replaced               a hunting and gathering way of life.  The data available,                       however, is limited to archaeological excavations in a small                    number of caves and rock shelters and no settlements themselves                 have been located and excavated.  In this first stage of a larger               project, Dr. Barton and his collaborators will conduct surveys in               three river valleys in an attempt to locate such occurrences.  A                combination of random sampling and directed survey will be                      employed both to maximize the number of sites discovered and to                 understand their distribution across the landscape.  All sites                  will be recorded and selected materials recovered.  These data                  will provide the basis to plan future work.                                                                                                                     The Neolithic Revolution - the domestication of plants and                      animals - constitutes a major revolution in human cultural                      development and paved the way for the rise of complex societies.                While much archaeological attention has focussed on the \"core\" or               \"nuclear\" areas where domestication took place, relatively little               is understood about its spread to other areas.  Two competing                   models exist to explain how Near Eastern agriculture entered                    Europe.  One group argues that the spread of traits was                         accompanied by large scale population movements and that people                 employing new technology moved out of the Near East into Europe.                Others believe that change resulted primarily through the spread                of ideas and traits rather than people themselves and that the                  original populations merely adopted and adapted to a new style of               life.  Dr. Barton will address this issue in his Spanish research               and he will focus on sites which date to immediately before and                 after agriculture and pastoralism appear.                                                                                                                       This research is important for several reasons.  First, it will                 increase our understanding of a poorly known period in European                 prehistory.  It will provide data of interest to a large number                 of archaeologists.  It will also shed light on how major cultural               transformations take place.",
