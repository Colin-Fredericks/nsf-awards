 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world-wide market for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE,                        an octane enhancer) is projected to reach 26 billion                            pounds per year during the 1990's.  A recent ARCO study                         concludes that ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) is a more                          desirable fuel additive than MBTE.  Conventional                                technology requires distillation of fermentation ethanol                        prior to the synthesis of ETBE.  One focus of this                              proposal is the acid-catalyzed synthesis of ETBE in near-                       or supercritical water, thereby avoiding costly                                 distillation.  Because ETBE is insoluble in water,                              separation of ETBE from the aqueous phase exiting the                           reactor is facile.  A second focus of this proposal is the                      acid-catalyzed synthesis of a mixture of ethyl butyl                            ethers (EBE) in near- or supercritical water from                               fermentation products ethanol and 1-butanol.  Mixed EBE's                       should have fuel properties similar the ETBE, and would be                      a fully renewable high octane fuel additive.                                                                                                                    The proposed research emphasizes kinetic studies of the                         acid-catalyzed mechanism of ether formation in near- and                        supercritical water using two plug flow reactors.  Kinetic                      models developed during this work will be useful for                            reactor design and scale-up.  This research will also help                      to clarify the extent to which kinetics can be used to                          detail mechanism.",
