 "awd_abstract_narration": "Initial experiments with a graph reduction model for                       nondeterministic program control indicate that this is a viable and             natural approach.  Appropriate reduction rules for and and or                   combinators together with a new type of tagged node (alt nodes)                 enable the straightforward compilation of declarative language                  statements to graph sections whose reduction by simple rewrite rules            will effect backtracking.  Other graph reduction approaches to logic            languages place this burden on the metalanguage.                                                                                                                     The matching of an operational graph reduction model with a                denotational semantics for the declarative language B provides an               elegant framework for extension to full logic programming and the               future incorporation of more advanced control structures.  Although             the current model abstracts the complexities of state by making                 explicit a state argument, there are appropriate alternative                    strategies that can be employed in the extension.  Other investigators          are currently producing graph reduction models incorporating                    appropriate behavior for logic variables, which will be considered in           our extension.                                                                                                                                                       The main objective is to develop the current model to correctly            and efficiently model sophisticated control for declarative languages.          Investigation of methods to superimpose Prolog's cut is already                 underway.  The model will seek ways to incorporate the necessary                control information into the graph.  The success of simple alt nodes            in modeling nondeterminism is an encouraging start.",
