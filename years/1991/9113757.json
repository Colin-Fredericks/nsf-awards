 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of forming processes, particularly those involving              aluminum alloys, is the focus of the research of this collaborative             project between the University and industry.  The work will attempt             to utilize the complementary aspects of backward-tracing algorithms             and the ideal forming theory based on the minimum plastic work path             concepts. The design sensitivity calculations will be used as the               vehicle for relating one to the other.  A unified manufacturing                 design strategy that attempts to optimize simultaneously the                    geometric and material specifications for the preform, as well as               the temporal and spatial characteristics of the process parameters,             is the immediate goal of this research.                                              The design strategy will be applied to the design of real-life             forming processes, and the  results will be experimentally                      verified.  The design strategy will eventually be extended to                   include issues of product design as well.  This will allow the                  realization of an long-term goal of concurrent, rather than                     sequential, design of formed products and forming processes.",
