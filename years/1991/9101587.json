 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed experimental research program is designed to                       address those fundamental, structural, mesogenic, and                           configurational features of liquid crystalline polymers and                     closely related polymer structures which confer high barrier                    properties upon liquid crystalline polymers as a class of                       materials.  The research will focus upon explicit comparison                    of the properties of isotropic, amorphous, and disordered                       polymers and the identical polymers which have developed                        liquid crystalline order by solvent or thermal treatment.                       Moreover, the effect of systematic structure and                                configurational changes on sorption and transport behavior of                   liquid crystalline polymers will further define the role of                     liquid crystalline order on the barrier properties of liquid                    crystalline polymeric materials.  These fundamental studies                     are directed toward developing an expanded and more subtle                      repertoire of structural modifications which would be useful                    for the rational tailoring of super-barriers based upon liquid                  crystalline polymers and will also provide useful mechanistic                   insight into the fundamental basis for high permeability in                     disordered rigid-rod polymeric materials.  Central to the                       thesis under consideration is the notion that extremely subtle                  structural, mesogenic, and configurational features                             distinguish the most permeable from the least permeable                         polymeric materials.                                                                                                                                            This project is jointly supported by NSF and the Electric                       Power Research Institute (EPRI), following a special NSF-EPRI                   research initiative on polymeric materials.",
