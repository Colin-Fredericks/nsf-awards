 "awd_abstract_narration": "Signaled occurrences of food, rivals, predators, or mates produce               Pavlovian-conditioned anticipatory responses in all vertebrates,                including humans.  The ability of so many different animals to                  exhibit this type of learning in so many different contexts would               suggest that the anticipatory response is probably highly                       adaptive.  However, despite intense interest shown in the                       biological function of Pavlovian conditioning over the last                     twenty-five years, direct experimental investigations have been                 sparse.  Recently, however, several studies have demonstrated the               adaptive value of Pavlovian conditioning in the aggressive and                  reproductive behavior of a territorial freshwater fish.  The aim                of this project is to explore in greater detail the way in which                Pavlovian conditioning enhances animals' aggressive and                         reproductive strategies.                                                                                                                                        One study will determine whether signals accompanying aggressive                encounters predispose winners and losers to assume different                    strategies in subsequent contests.  Other experiments will                      explore how conditioning affects the frequency and duration of                  aggressive behavior.  Finally, the role of signaling in females'                choice of mates will be examined.  Almost nothing is known about                the role that Pavlovian conditioning plays in naturally-occurring               aggressive and reproductive behavior, despite the fact that                     conditioned aggressive and reproductive responses are easily                    evoked in many animals, including humans.  These studies will                   redress that problem as well as shed light on the long-standing                 question of what is learned in Pavlovian conditioning.",
