 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Oklahoma State University for the renovation and repair of its                  research and research training facilities for physical and                      chemical materials research located in the Physical Sciences                    Building.  This building was constructed in 1960 and has not been               renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $800,000 and                     $800,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to                modernize these research and research training facilities.  This                project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure by providing upgraded utility systems; heating,                  ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); and additional fume                    hoods.  The renovation will be of particular benefit to Oklahoma                State University's research on synthesis and characterization of                optical materials, which is one of the leading research efforts in              the nation in this area, and it will enable the clustering of                   faculty with common interests.                                                                                                                                  This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of undergraduate and graduate                  students in the field of materials research.  This renovation will              help Oklahoma State University fulfill the major commitment it has              made to increasing the number and quality of students in the human              resources pipeline through Research Experience for Undergraduates,              Research Careers for Minority Scholars, Young Scholars, and similar             programs directed especially toward populations that are                        underrepresented in the field.",
