 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description:  This proposal seeks funding for a small                 portion of an Indo-U.S. collaborative effort that has begun                     building a capability of astronomical observation of comets and                 asteroids at the Kavalur Observatory, Indian Institute of                       Astrophysics in Bangalore.  This  program has been undertaken in                consultation with  Dr. Tom Gehrels and staff at the University of               Arizona, Tucson.  The proposed Indian system will emulate the                   Spacewatch system for astroid exploration that Dr. Gehrels has                  pioneered at the Steward observatory.  This proposal will allow                 for closer collaboration with the Indian participants and in                    addition to their annual visits to Tuscon will provide them with                the necessary computer software, hardware, and procedures for for               their own Spacewatch System.  The system requires continuous                    updates and immediate communication with India particularly for                 discoveries of near-Earth asteroids.  The study of asteroids has                become a well established discipline, important for the                         understanding of our origins as well as for the dynamical                       evolution of near-Earth objects.  The relationship between                      asteroids, comets and meteorites is an area of major scientific                 interest that has become enhanced through the use of charge-                    coupled devices (CCD) for scanning rather than photographic                     scanning.                                                                                                                                                       Scope:  A program of asteroid exploration is important not only                 for the interesting scientific information but also as a base of                knowledge to begin the exploitation of non-terrestrial resources.               These may provide sources of water and metals or even such                      economically important resources such as cobalt and platinum.  An               increase in the number of telescopes in the world that can do                   this kind of work can lead to important discoveries.  The                       facility in India will be world-class and the capability will be                there for making a significant contribution.  This program will                 facilitate the transfer of knowledge from other countries to                    India, because the India Institute for Astrophysics (IIA) will                  have very capable hardware and software, which will attract                     scientists throughout the world.",
