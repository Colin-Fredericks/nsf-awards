 "awd_abstract_narration": "An unprecedented loss of the variety and numbers of plant                  and animals species around the world is occurring.  Habitat                     destruction, over-harvesting, chemical pollution, introduced                    exotic species, and climatic change are among the major threats                 to living species.  In particular, many species of amphibians are               undergoing drastic  population declines and range reductions.                   The amphibian declines are especially perplexing because many                   species are disappearing in pristine habitats.  Atmospheric                     factors, perhaps acting with other agents, may be contributing                  to the declines.                                                                     Using amphibians, Dr. Blaustein and his colleagues propose                 to investigate one potential atmospheric source of biological                   trauma, ultraviolet radiation (UV), that may have significant                   biological effects ultimately contributing to population                        declines.  Amphibians are excellent \"bioindicators\" of                          environmental change, due in part to their relatively thin,                     permeable and unprotected skin.  The decline in amphibians may be               an early warning signal and ultimately, other organisms,                        including humans, may be in peril.  Results should yield                        information with broad implications regarding the potential for                 atmospheric effects on other organisms.                                                The investigation will be focused at several levels of                   biological organization including molecular, individual, and                    population levels.  Laboratory and field experiments will examine               the effects of natural levels of UV on developing tadpoles and on               the reproductive physiology of adult frogs.  How UV-damaged DNA                 is repaired will also be examined.  An ecological survey of                     declining species will be conducted to document their overall                   population status.                                                                   This is one of the first studies to incorporate field                      experiments to investigate the effects of UV on development in                  wild vertebrates.  Since conditions likely to promote increased                 UV are becoming manifest, it is important to examine whether                    natural levels of UV have begun to affect the more sensitive                    animals, like amphibians, so that steps can be taken to reduce a                potentially serious environmental threat.",
