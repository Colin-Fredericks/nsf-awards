 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals of many species can distinguish between kin and unrelated               individuals.  Studies of kin recognition have enhanced our                      knowledge of how behavior develops and have provided important                  information about the evolution of sociality.  Unfortunately, the               ecological and evolutionary significance of kin recognition is                  still poorly understood, as is the significance of the behavior                 patterns that are used to assess such recognition.                                                                                                              To better understand the evolutionary significance of kin                       recognition, Drs. Blaustein and Walls will test predictions about               the functions of this behavior in a model animal system--that of                salamanders, in which kin-recognition behavior can be quantified                unambiguously by acts of aggression.  They also will use                        laboratory experiments to compare the development of kin                        recognition in at least two species that differ in key ecological               and behavioral traits.  Because many species of amphibians,                     including many salamanders, shift from aquatic to terrestrial                   environments as they grow and develop, salamanders are an ideal                 system for examining the development of animal behavior.  By                    observing behavioral interactions in the laboratory and by                      rearing salamanders in an artificial-pond experiment, Drs.                      Blaustein and Walls will examine whether or not kinship                         influences aggression and cannibalism, growth and survivorship,                 and aggregation behavior in larval forms.  Rearing individuals to               maturity will also permit tests of hypotheses about the possible                function of kin recognition in terrestrial adults.                                                                                                              By increasing our knowledge of the roles of genetic and learned                 components in the development of behavior, studies of kin                       recognition in general are greatly enhancing our understanding of               the development of behavior in a wide variety of organisms,                     including humans.  Furthermore, kin-recognition studies have                    become extremely important in captive-breeding programs for                     endangered species because many animals recognize their relatives               and will avoid incestuous matings.",
