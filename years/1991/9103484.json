 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general question addressed in this project is:  how do sex             steroid hormones cause maturation of reproduction organs?  A model              system for the study of this question is the immature female rat.               When such a rat is given an injection of estradiol (E2), a very                 rapid development of the uterus ensues.  One of the first                       detectable biochemical changes is an increase in two proteins -                 tissue factor (TF) and thrombin.  Because they are among the first              things to change, it seems possible or even likely that they may                be involved in the further development of the uterus - that E2                  activates them, and they in turn activate other developmental                   processes.                                                                                                                                                           Both proteins are associated with cell division in other                   biological systems.  When the smooth muscle cells lining blood                  vessels are stimulated to grow, increases in TF occur.  Thrombin                is a stimulator of cell division in fibroblast and may be important             in the process of wound healing.  Since both proteins are present               in the uterus as it begins to grow they may be involved with                    uterine development under the control of E2 .  Our investigations               are directed at proving this hypothesis.                                                                                                                             Our studies are complicated by the fact that thrombin is                   generated in biological systems from a precursor - prothrombin -                by the enzymes of the coagulation cascade which begins with TF.                 A question we must answer is whether TF acts as a growth factor per             se or as the initiator of thrombin generation through the                       coagulation cascade.  The aims of this project are:  1) to show                 that thrombin causes cell division in the uterus after E2                       stimulation and 2) to find out whether TF acts directly on the                  uterus or indirectly by the generation of thrombin.                                                                                                                  This research will increase our understanding of a normal                  biological process - the maturation of one of the organs of                     reproduction.//",
