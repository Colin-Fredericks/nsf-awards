 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Dr. Timothy Earle, Mr. Robert Rechtman will               collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  He will radiocarbon                date samples of bone and charcoal collected during archaeological               fieldwork in the Fiji Islands.  In all, 35 samples will be dated.               During fieldwork on Wakaya Island in central Fiji, Mr. Rechtman                 conducted a complete survey and located ten substantial fortified               sites.  Two of these, Korolevu with a ring'ditch wall and Delaini               with a different stone wall system of defence were excavated.  In               the process, Mr. Rechtman collected extensive ceramic, floral and               faunal remains as well as human burial material.  His most                      immediate goal is to reconstruct the cultural sequence for this                 area which is poorly archaeologically known.  In conjunction with               ceramic seriation, the radiocarbon dates should provide the                     necessary ordering.                                                                                                                                             The Fiji Islands, together with the rest of Polynesia, are of                   great interest to anthropologists because of the complex highly                 organized chiefly societies which arose there.  Because the                     Polynesian islands were originally populated by a single group of               people and because different islands exhibit distinctive kinds of               social organization, anthropologists look for cross-island                      similarities and differences in environment and history in an                   attempt to explain social variation.  Fiji is known for the                     development of two fort types and several scenarios have been                   proposed for how they emerged.  Some anthropologists posit that                 sequential waves of migrants are responsible for differences -                  and for the development of warfare - while others believe that                  strictly internal forces played a dominant role.  The problem is                that few sites have been excavated and those which have received                archaeological attention have not been securely placed in time.                                                                                                                                                                                 Mr. Rechtman's research is important for several reasons.  It                   will produce a cultural sequence of interest to many                            archaeologists.  It will shed light on the emergence of warfare                 and its role in the development of social complexity.  It will                  also further the training of a promising young scientist.",
