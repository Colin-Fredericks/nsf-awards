 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analyzing the chemical and physical processes occurring in                      chemical reactor dynamics has practical uses over and above                     the elucidation of fundamental phenomena.  An understanding of                  these processes and being able to determine the controlling                     parameters is necessary for design and scaleup of industrial                    reactors.  This research project is a continuation of the                       principal investigator's work on the unsteady state behavior                    of electrochemical reactors.  Such systems are ideal for                        fundamental studies of reaction dynamics because they are                       relatively stationary (they have less drift over the time                       scale of the dynamics) and they exhibit many types of                           interesting dynamic behavior such as complex periodic                           oscillations, low order chaos, quasiperiodicity, etc.  The                      parameters are easily controlled (potential or current, for                     example) so that transitions among states can be investigated.                                                                                                                                                                                  In this project several dynamic phenomena will be studied                       using electrochemical reactions.  The studies will include                      surface patterns and the relationship of temporal and spatial                   behavior, transitions from low order chaos to more complex                      phenomena, coupled systems, and studies of bifurcation among                    states.  The experimental work will involve electrodissolution                  of metals, electrodeposition, and electrocatalytic reactions.                   The results will be analyzed using methods from nonlinear                       dynamics (including neural networks) and will compare                           experimental data with model predictions.",
