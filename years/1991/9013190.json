 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sevilleta Region of Central New Mexico is a large and                       ecologically area, and is utilized extensively by a growing                     number of research scientists.  The region includes latitudinal,                longitudinal and elevational transition zones among numerous                    biomes, including Great Plains Grassland, Chihuahuan Desert,                    Great Basin Shrub-steppe, Interior Chapparal, Mogollon                          (Pinyon-Juniper) Woodland, and Montane Forest.  Additional biotic               assemblages within these biomes include Rio Grande \"Bosque\"                     (Riparian Cottonwood                                                            Forests) and Wetlands, Subalpine Forests, and Subalpine                         Grasslands.  Current scientific research in the region focuses on               biotic                                                                          responses to climate changes at various time scales (seasonal,                  annual, and long-term), biodiversity issues, and ecosystem                      restoration following natural and anthropogenic disturbances.                                                                                                   At present, the University of New Mexico maintains a small                      research field station on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge                (a 100,000 ha, centrally located study area), designed to support               up to 6                                                                         field researchers.  However, the recent user population of the                  station had dramatically increased.  In the last five years, the                Sevilleta has served as a research site for 125 researchers,                    representing 17 universities, 9 U.S. Government agencies, 3 New                 Mexico State Government agencies, 2 private institutes, and 1                   foreign country.  The 1989 station population included 57                       researchers (plus technicians and graduate students), with up to                35 scientists and technicians operating simultaneously out of the               station during peak summer research months (April through                       October).                                                                       This project will expand the station's facilities and                           significantly increase station capacity.  The benefits of a                     centrally located, expanded Sevilleta Field Station to the                      scientific community                                                            included:                                                                            1.   ready access to the many populations and ecosystems                             present in the area;                                                       2.   improve logistical support for field research projects;                    3.   enhanced on-site analysis and data processing                                   capabilities, GIS and data management systems; and                         4.   an intellectual environment derived from the wide                               variety of scientists from numerous disciplines and                             institutions.",
