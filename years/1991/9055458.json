 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will provide training over a 32-month period to                   improve the instructional skills of 60 middle school science                    teachers.  The major objectives of the project is to improve                    the teaching effectiveness of middle school teachers (4-9) in                   Educational Service Units                                                       Nebraska. This objective will be fulfilled by means of: (1)                     three-week summer workshops and (2) evening sessions                            conducted throughout the academic year.                                                                                                                         The basic purposes of the summer program are to permit a                        cadre of teachers to improve their process skills, teaching                     methodology, and critical thinking skills by involving them                     in a teaching strategy known as the Inquiry Role Approach.                      This cadre of teachers will be utilized as resource persons                     in their local service unit areas and to assist as team                         leaders in workshops and seminars dealing with (a) life,                        earth, and physical science content; (b) Inquiry Role                           Approach teaching methodology, and (c) schoolyard science.                                                                                                      The academic year meetings will encompass the disciplines of                    life, earth and physical science.  Each discipline will be                      organized into a number of content topics designed for an                       evening session of three hours.  One-half hour prior to each                    evening session, a staff member will be available for                           consultation on science content or science curricula.                                                                                                           In summary, this project is designed to improve the teaching                    effectiveness of middle school science teachers by using the                    Inquiry Role Approach as the major instructional strategy.                      The content of earth, life and physical science will be                         emphasized through field trips, class discussions, lectures,                    and the individualization of laboratory activities.                                                                                                             No cost sharing is included in this proposal.",
