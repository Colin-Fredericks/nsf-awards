 "awd_abstract_narration": "A revised bioengineering curriculum has been adopted that                       emphasizes the integration of introductory science with early                   engineering studies. An essential component of this curriculum                  is that each semester includes a laboratory course that will                    serve to integrate all aspects of the program.  The                             \"workstation library\" includes the necessary computational,                     data acquisition and data handling infrastructure needed to                     make operation of the new curriculum and laboratories feasible.                 It includes hardware, in the form of 20 Unix-based workstations                 integrated with the laboratory, the server that networks the                    workstations, and software for mathematical manipulation,                       simulation, and symbolic manipulation, as well as report                        preparation and presentation. The workstation network is                        accessible through the existing university computer network,                    allowing off-site access to the workstations. Laboratory                        instruments will also be accessed through the workstation                       network. The aim is to make the laboratory as essential and                     important a component of each student's learning and                            educational experience as are other information sources such as                 libraries and texts.",
