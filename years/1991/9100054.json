 "awd_abstract_narration": "Habitat use during migration has profound consequences for a               bird's ability to satisfy energy requirements, vulnerability to                 predators, and exposure to environmental  stress.  The proposed                 research quantifies habitat use during spring and fall en route                 periods.  Presumably migrants select particular habitats because                they thereby enhance their fitness.  Although it would be                       difficult to measure directly the effect of en route use of                     habitat on survival and reproductive success, it is possible to                 evaluate the immediate consequences in relation to how                          effectively migrants satisfy energy demand during migration, i.e.               deposit fat reserves and gain body mass.                                             Over half of all North American landbirds are long-distance                migrants that journey between temperature breeding ranges and                   more tropical wintering areas.  Decline in populations of                       Neotropical landbird migrants is linked to habitat loss on the                  wintering grounds and fragmentation of forested breeding                        habitats.  Because the persistence of migrant populations depends               on the bird's ability to find favorable conditions throughout the               annual cycle, factors associated with the en route ecology of                   migrants must figure in the formulation of sound conservation                   policy.",
