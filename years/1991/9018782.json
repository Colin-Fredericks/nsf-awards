 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to contribute to the understanding                 of the physical basis of post-replicative repair of DNA damage                  and genetic recombination.  In the prokaryotic organism                         Escherichia coli, recombination and repair are controlled by                    the activities of RecA protein.  In vitro, RecA exhibits a                      manifold of activities (DNA binding, strand exchange catalysis,                 ATPase, proteolysis, etc.) making it the current paradigm for                   general genetic recombination, in vivo.  Intrinsic to its                       functions, RecA exists in various assembled and/or disassembled                 quaternary states including (ostensibly) monomers, small                        aggregates of monomers (protomers), aggregates of protomers                     (filaments) and large bundles of self-assembled filaments.                      Although a number of conventional biochemical techniques                        (chemical crosslinking, size-exclusion chromatography,                          centrifugation-sedimentation, optical turbidity and electron                    microscopy) have been applied to probe the phyical behavior of RecA             protein, the mechamisms governing formation for the various                     quaternary forms of RecA remain to be elucidated.                               In the proposed research light scattering techniques                            complemented by electron microscopy will be employed to address                 eight fundamental questions about RecA: (1) What are the                        fundamental kinetic mechanisms governing RecA protein self-                     assembly?  (2) What is the nature of the protein-protein                        interactions involved in self-assembly of RecA?  (3) What is                    the associated state of RecA in solution under in vitro strand                  exchange conditions?  (4) What are the quaternary form(s) of                    RecA that bind DNA?  (5) To what extent do processes of RecA                    self-assembly and RecA assembly on single strand and double                     stranded DNA compete with one another?  (6) How do nucleotide                   sequence, fragment length and secondary structures of DNA                       influence the associated states of RecA?  (7) Which quaternary                  forms bind nucleotide tri-and di-phosphates?  (8) What is the                   nature of the DNA sequence dependent ATPase activity of RecA                    protein?                                                                        The information gained from these studies should provide                        fundamental information not accessible by any other means.                      Development of light scattering methodology and its successful                  application to study the solution behavior of RecA and RecA/DNA                 complexes will pave the way for further studies of a number of                  other regulatory proteins (microtubules and helicases, for                      example) whose functional activities critically depend on                       intermolecular association to various quaternary forms.",
