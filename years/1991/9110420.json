 "awd_abstract_narration": "HeII (superfluid helium), the low temperature phase of liquid                   helium existing below 2.2 K, has numerous technical                             applications.  Because of its unique properties, namely                         extremely high heat conductivity and in some cases vanishing                    viscosity, He II is the preferred coolant for a variety of low                  temperature devices, including superconducting magnet systems                   and space based cryogenic facilities.  An understanding of                      basic HeII heat transfer mechanisms is important for these                      applications.                                                                                                                                                   This project addresses this need through analytical and                         experimental studies of HeII in parallel and counterflow heat                   exchangers.  The analytical work consists of obtaining                          solutions to the HeII energy equation applied to two forced                     flow HeII channels thermally coupled by a heat exchange                         surface.  Experimental measurements are required to benchmark                   the analytical work as well as to provide quantitative values                   for physical parameters, particularly the Kapitza conductance.                  The primary measurements consist of temperature profiles                        within the flowing HeII contained on both sides of a                            parallel/counterflow heat exchanger.  Heat exchanger                            length-to-diameter ratio, fluid velocity and bath temperature                   are varied to obtain a range of parameters necessary for                        developing correlations.  Although the immediate goal of the                    work is a comparison of analytical results with experimental                    measurements, a secondary purpose is to develop a design                        procedure for HeII parallel/counterflow heat exchangers using                   correlations or other empirical expressions derived from our                    fundamental studies.",
