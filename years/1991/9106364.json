 "awd_abstract_narration": "All cellular RNA molecules are synthesized as immature                          precursors bearing 5' or 3' terminal extensions which must be                   removed during RNA maturation or processing.  Despite the                       fundamental importance of RNA processing reactions,most are                     not well-understood biochemically.  In particular, little is                    known about these processes in  the nuclei and organelles of                    higher plants.  Here this focus is on the key reactions of                      transfer RNA processing; formation of mature 5' termini by                      the endonuclease ribonuclease P, and formation of mature                        3'termini by as yet uncharacterized endonuclease(s).  RNase                     Ps previously described from eubacteria yeast and vertebrates                   have an RNA component.  In the eubacterial enzymes, this RNA                    is the catalytic subunit, whereas its role in nuclear enzymes                   is unknown.  Surprisingly, RNase Ps from plant nuclei and                       chloroplasts appears to lack an accessible RNA subunit like                     that of eubacteria.  In the studies proposed here, the                          physical structure of purified RNase P from plant                               chloroplasts and nuclei will be elucidated.  In particular                      the presence or absence of any RNA components in these                          enzymes will be verified.  To understand how RNase Ps with                      different structures accomplish the same reaction.  The basic                   features of substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism of                    plant RNase Ps and will be compared to them with those                          established for eubacterial RNase P.",
