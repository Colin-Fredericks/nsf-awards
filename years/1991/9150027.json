 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics of the           National Council of Teachers of Mathematics calls for a shift in                paradigm in the teaching of school mathematics from skills-based                instruction to problem-based instruction.  This proposal describes a            research project in which the effects of problem-based instruction on           the concepts and thought processes of high school geometry students will        be studied.  Over the course of the proposed three-year project, a              teaching model which focuses on student solving of problems and which is        accessible to students of varying abilities will be designed.  The              effects of the instruction will be assessed from two contrasting yet            interactive perspectives--use of problem-solving processes and knowledge        of particular geometric concepts.  The geometric problem-solving                processes to be investigated include the abilities to (a) generalize            from empirical evidence, (b) generalize using deductive evidence, (c)           deal with reverse trains of thought, (d) flexibly refocus a train of            thought, and (e) visualize a geometric situation.  The geometric                concepts to be investigated include the concepts of (a) proof, (b)              infinity, (c) similarity and congruence, (d) area, perimeter, and               volume, (e) parallelism, and (f) transformations.  Data collection will         be three-fold, including (a) teaching experiments with individual               students to assess particular instructional approaches; and (b) teaching        experiments with intact classes to assess the changing nature of                instruction and classroom interactions; and (c) status testing to               document developing concepts and processes.                                                                                                                     This project is jointly funded by the Instructional Materials                   Development Program.",
