 "awd_abstract_narration": "A User Services Area Council (USAC) has been established to                promote and encourage creative exchange of international user                   service needs and concepts.  Constructive input from various                    national and international user services organizations' efforts is              also encouraged.  USAC will be responsible for researching and                  defining short term and long term user services needs and                       coordinating developments in finding solutions.                                      The proposed effort is to chair and direct the USAC to promote             cooperation and collaboration on user services issues of the                    Internet on an international and global scale.  Funding will be                 provided for the attendance at three meetings during the next 12                months: the RARE meeting in Brussels, the RIPE meeting in Geneva,               and the COSINE meeting in Paris.                                                     Thus USAC intends to provide a forum of global internet                    collaboration by encouraging and coordinating international                     interaction between existing global user services groups.  It will              also provide guidance to countries that are just beginning to                   develop and provide their user services communities with support.",
