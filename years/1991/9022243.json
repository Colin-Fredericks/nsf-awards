 "awd_abstract_narration": "Though discussion about sustainable yield and production systems                in agriculture has intensified in recent years, very little                     attention has focused on urban food systems.  The proposed                      research on the practices of selected cities across the U.S. thus               addresses a pressing social problem and a neglected area of                     research.  The research will provide a description of local food                production, availability, and disposal as they are influenced by                organizations, municipal policies, and values.  In addition, the                research will include a review of options to make local food                    systems more sustainable.  Alternatives will be examined to                     determine their organizational and policy requirements,                         underlying value assumptions, and ecological soundness.  Finally,               the investigator will produce a profile useful for policy                       analysis and a module for teaching which describes different food               system policies, impacts, values, and choices.  The project is                  structured to provide the investigator regular consultation with                selected Advisors representing areas of expertise pertinent to                  the investigation.  This project is distinctive in seeking to                   supply a knowledge base about production practices, values, and                 options and also to generate products for policy use and for                    teaching.  Emanating from prior work by the investigator and                    pulling together threads of related work from other fields, the                 study promises to further the wide-ranging reflection on                        sustainability now underway in agriculture, urban/community, and                ethics studies. Results will be widely disseminated in                          appropriate journals and periodicals and professional meetings.                                                                                                 This proposal is a modest request for support to enable a very                  well qualified investigator with a very good track record to                    investigate urban food sytems and sustainability options bringing               out issues of policy and values.  The institutional support is                  very good; the research design and plan for the educational                     module are well developed; dissemination is likely to be broad                  and to reach a wide range of audiences.  Support is highly                      recommended.",
