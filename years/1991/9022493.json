 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                             Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Meyer will                    continue fundamental studies of the photochemistry of                           transition metal complexes.  This work may provide a framework                  by which our understanding of natural processes such as                         photosynthesis will be enhanced.                                                                                                                                The principal goal of the work is to gain insights into the                     fundamental details of how electron and energy transfer occur                   following MLCT excitation and how they can be controlled by                     synthetic design.  Studies of electron transfer in the inverted                 region, including a detailed study of temperature and medium                    effects, will be continued.  New intramolecular redox systems                   will be prepared which contain a variety of both electron                       transfer donors and acceptors.  A systematic study of the redox                 separated states formed by the photolysis of these complexes                    will be directed toward the goal of maximizing quantum                          efficiencies and lifetimes.  Chemical systems will be assembled                 that feature intramolecular time delays, in which the                           interconversion of two states is mediated by a third, higher                    energy state.  A final goal is the preparation of a family of                   extended, ligand-bridged complexes which will provide a means                   for studying electron transfer over very long distances.",
