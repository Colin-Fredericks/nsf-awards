 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study the behavior of                      singularities arising in harmonic maps, minimal surfaces, and                   certain problems in mechanics. The questions to be considered                   include the possibility of prescribing the location of                          singularities and their behavior as well as questions on the                    structure of spaces of harmonic maps with singularities. Specific               investigations will focus on liquid crystals, ferromagnetics,                   p-harmonic maps, and geodesics in varieties.                                         Many functions, mappings, and spaces arising in models of our              physical surroundings involve singularities. Two of the most                    familiar settings in which the study of singularities plays an                  important role are liquid crystal and minimal surfaces. Liquid                  crystals are commonly used to display characters in digital watches             and laptop computer screens. Minimal surfaces are those surfaces                which span a closed curve and have smallest area. A physical                    example is a soap bubble which spans a wire loop. By introducing                twists in the loop, one may easily produce a soap bubble with                   singularities. The principal investigator will study these                      singularities  using techniques from geometric measure theory. A                major aspect of the work is to develop general techniques which can             then be applied to a wide range of problems.",
