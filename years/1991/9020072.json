 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analyses of rates of change in fossil-pollen data from                     eastern North America reveal that many sites experienced major                  changes 10,000-13,000 years ago during the last deglaciation and                again during the last 1000 years.  The PIs propose to expand                    previous research to several new regions of the northern                        hemisphere, and to determine the timing, magnitude, and                         geographic patterns of changes in climate and vegetation during                 the past 18,000 years in northwestern as well as eastern North                  America.  They will also use a parallel database in Europe to                   study the patterns and rates of change in Europe over the last                  18,000 years, for comparison with North America.  Through use of                pollen databases for North America and Europe, this research will               establish the degree to which rapid vegetation changes in a broad               band around the northern hemisphere are synchronous, and will                   thus identify probable times of major rapid changes in                          atmospheric circulation.                                                             In addition, special attention will be given to a critical                 site, Lake Tulane, Florida which has a continuous high-resolution               pollen stratigraphy extending to at least 45,000 years ago.  The                pollen stratigraphy from Lake Tulane exhibits major, abrupt                     changes, which may correlate with as yet poorly understood                      isotope fluctuations in the Dye 3 Greenland ice core during the                 period 25,000-55,000 years ago.  The results of the research will               provide very important data on the nature and extent of global                  change in the last 20,000 years.",
