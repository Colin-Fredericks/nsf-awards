 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current network management technologies and standards are based              on a centralized management paradigm.  Management logic is                      centralized in managers who access management-information bases                 (MIBs) at device agents.  Manageability is bounded by the number of             MIB variables that may be centrally accessed and the access speed.              Thus management does not scale for large, complex, high-speed or                low bandwidth networks.  This project aims to develop and study a               novel alternative to centralized management:  management by                     delegation.  Management applications would, under this paradigm,                delegate programs to agents who will apply them to monitor and                  control network devices.  Management functions could be flexibly                distributed to agents and execute in close proximity to devices.                Delegation thus decentralizes management rendering it scalable for              large, complex and fast networks.  Success in this project would                mean that the principal investigator has established novel                      protocols for delegation of programs and remote control of their                executions; created efficient architectures for execution,                      coordination and security of management; established semantic                   models of management functions and language constructs to script                them; established the performance behaviors of the proposed                     delegation mechanisms in comparison to current centralized                      management models; embedded and demonstrated these technologies                 within real network-management systems and tools, and exported them             to academia and industry.  Success would mean that the research has             resulted in establishing unifying principles and mechanisms for                 effective distributed scalable network management.",
