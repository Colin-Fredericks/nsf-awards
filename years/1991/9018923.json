 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is much to be learned about how chromosomes are faithfully                transmitted during mitosis and meiosis.  Determining the detailed               structure of an entire eucaryotic chromosome should yield much                  information about its functions.  As a first step towards this                  goal, we have been examining the structure of the 250 kb DNA                    molecule from chromosome I, the smallest Saccharomyces cerevisiae               chromosome.  We have cloned almost all of it and have determined                the physical location of all but two of its classically                         identified genes on a restriction map of the entire chromosomal                 DNA molecule.  In collaborative efforts, we have determined the                 transcription map on 160 kb of chromosome I and are in the                      process of locating all the cloned ARS elements.  We propose to                 continue elucidating the transcription map of the entire                        chromosome.  These studies will provide the foundation for                      further analyses on many aspects of chromosome function and                     behavior.                                                                                                                                                       Classical genetic studies have succeeded in identifying less than               20% of all yeast genes.  In this respect, chromosome I is                       typical.  Hybridization studies suggested that chromosome I                     encodes 90-100 genes.  However, despite intense efforts, only 15                of these genes were identified by classically obtained mutations.               These proportions also apply to essential genes.  The number of                 essential genes identified by classical genetic studies                         throughout the entire yeast genome and on chromosome I in                       particular was far lower than predicted.  If we are to understand               the molecular biology of a simple organism, it would be                         advantageous to have a more complete set of mutations in genes                  essential for its life cycle.  It is clear that molecular                       approaches are needed to obtain this large number of mutants.  We               have already produced deletion mutations in 28 genes that were                  defined only by the presence of an unidentified transcribed                     region.  Five of these genes were essential for vegetative growth               on rich medium.  Counting the previously identified genes, we now               have mutants for 41 of the 90-100 genes on this chromosome.                     Based on these results, we suggest that 18-24% (1100-1500) of the               genes in yeast are essential for growth on rich medium.  We                     propose to continue these studies in order to eventually obtain a               catalogue of mutants for every gene on chromosome I.  Deletion                  mutations in approximately 5 additional transcribed regions will                be produced using one-step gene replacement and their phenotypes                will be partially characterized.  These studies will enhance our                knowledge about a large number of genes that have not been                      investigated previously.",
