The objective of the research is to investigate                       the regulation of ferritin expression in plants.                                                                                                                Iron is required for critical reactions (e.g. cell division                     and respiration), as well as plant-specific reactions (e.g.                     photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation).  Alterations in iron                     storage in ferritin occur in chlorosis and nematode                             infection.  In animals, ferritin is encoded in a multigene                      family and is regulated by iron and through a conserved                         translational regulatory sequence.  Comparable information                      is lacking in plants.  Recently the investigators have                          shown that pea and soybean ferritins share 55-65% sequence                      identify with vertebrate ferritins, but soybean ferritin                        mRNA also encodes a transit peptide apparently related to                       the plastid location of ferritin.  The effect of iron on                        ferritin synthesis in plants is to change ferritin mRNA                         concentration.  In this project, which combines US and                          French expertise on ferritin and on gene expression in                          plants, the investigators will carry out a joint study of                       ferritin regulation and accumulation in plants during iron                      stress, nodule formulation, and seed development.  Ferritin                     cDNAs and antibodies will be used to examine:  1) ferritin                      sequences (regulatory and coding) in plant genomes, 2) the                      effect of iron on ferritin mRNA content and transcription,                      and 3) ferritin mRNA and protein accumulation during normal                     and abnormal nodulation, leaf maturation and seed formation.                    The results will be important for understanding iron                            metabolism and ferritin regulation in plants, as well as                        providing a model in the future for intracellular trafficking                   related to plastid development.",
