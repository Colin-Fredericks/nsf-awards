 "awd_abstract_narration": "Highly seasonal ecologies can severely impact the nutritional                   well-being and health status of individuals.  Two groups which                  are particularly at risk are mothers and their infants and young                children.  In order to survive in such situations socieities                    develop a variety of coping mechanisms that may buffer against                  the deleterious environmental conditions.                                                                                                                       The proposed research will undertake to determine the effects of                seasonal food supplies on the health of mothers and young                       children in the highlands of Lesotho, a southern African country                with highly seasonal food supplies.  Data will be gathered on                   seasonal ecology, household demographics, financial reseources,                 various aspects of diet, health and nutritional variables.                      Samples will be drawn from both the general population and a                    subset of those who attend a local health clinic.                                                                                                               It is hypothesized that women who show the greatest variability                 in weight will have the children with the poorest nutritional                   status and that those with the greatest dietary variety will                    maintain higher anthropometric status as well as the lowest                     incidence of infectious disease. It is also hypothesized that                   ther will be more dietary diversity in families in which both                   parents are present and/or maintain an extrended family                         structure.                                                                                                                                                      Such research will provide valuable information on the                          relationship of seasonal stresses and biosocial responses.",
