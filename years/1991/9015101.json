 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      John R. Pladziewicz of the University of Wisconsin at                           Milwaukee and Dr. Alan Sargeson at the Australian National                      University (ANU). This research is to investigate the extent                    to which electron-transfer reactions of metalloproteins                         depend on the three-dimensional structure of other reactants.                   Rates of electron transfer will be compared for metallo-                        proteins reacting with optical isomers, i.e., molecules which                   contain the same atoms connected in the same way, but which                     differ in their three-dimensional structure so that they are                    non-superimposable mirror images. The results of the project                    will explain the selectivity exhibited by many biological                       electron-transfer reactions and advance understanding of                        stereochemical control of biological electron transfer.                                                                                                         The project represents excellent collaboration between the                      U.S. and Australian researchers.The expertise and equipment                     for synthesizing certain novel metalloproteins essential to                     the project are available in the ANU laboratory.  This,                         combined with Dr. Pladziewicz's expertise in metalloprotein                     electron transfer studies, represents a combination of                          knowledge and skills for making progress on this chemistry                      not achievable by either laboratory separately. This is                         important fundamental work in stereochemical control of                         metalloprotein electron transfer, as well as having potential                   for developing biological sensors of molecules such as                          glucose and urea.",
