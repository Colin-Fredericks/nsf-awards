 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's complex system environment and competitive economic                     environment demand precise answers to questions concerning                      dependability and quality.  Current tools are not providing the                 ability to model complex fault handling scenarios and often require             simplifying assumptions about failure rates, repair rates,                      and initial states which lead to incorrect solutions.  Accurate                 dependability evaluations are a concern of both manufacturers and               users of systems who often invest millions of dollars to keep systems           operating correctly.  A dependability tool  that can address these              concerns is in demand in both the commercial and military                       environments.  The development of a simulation tool based on Rainbow            Nets is investigated.  Rainbow Nets overcome limitations of previous            net-based models by significantly reducing the model complexity.                This reduction is achieved by hierarchical tokens, which can be                 created, destroyed, and have identities and features, and by                    transitions whose activation is governed by a set of rules or an                algorithm.",
