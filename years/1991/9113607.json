 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish a Research Training Group in Language                 Acquisition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The                  faculty group includes 19 members of two departments: that of                   Linguistics and Philosophy, and that of Brain and Cognitive                     Science.  The RTG will establish a new, 5 year graduate program                 with elements drawn from the curricula of both departments.  The                funds awarded will provide stipends for graduate students,                      equipment needed for the training program, and limited travel                   funds and specialized technical assistance for the trainees.                                                                                                    An central focus of research in both linguistics and in cognition               has been understanding how the ability to use language develops                 in humans, both historically and individually.  Related questions               involve the representation of language in the brain, and the                    mechanism by which such representation is computed or manipulated               by the brain.  Separate progress in our understanding of the                    structure of languages, and of the structure and function of the                brain and of the other organs involved in speech has set the                    stage for significant multidisciplinary research that synthesizes               the experimental approaches and results of traditional                          linguistics, of psycholinguistics and of computational science.                 The training provided by this program will provide students will                the varied backgrounds and skills needed to do this kind of                     research.",
