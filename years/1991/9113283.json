 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses an                                              important area in automatic                                                     control, namely, robust adaptive                                                control.  The primary goal is to                                                draw a strong analogy between                                                   concepts from immunology and                                                    concepts from adaptive neurocontrol                                             and to use this analogy to enhance                                              the current practices in adaptive                                               neurocontrol.  Immunology is the                                                science of in-built defense                                                     mechanism that is present in all                                                living beings to protect them                                                   against external attacks.  The                                                  science of immunology has many                                                  parallels to the robust adaptive                                                control problem.  This project                                                  assumes that there is a  match                                                  between the concepts of                                                         neurocontrol, immunology, and                                                   genetic alogortihms, and if this                                                match is properly understood, there                                             is a great potential for scaling up                                             current trends in adaptive                                                      neurocontrol.  Objectives of the                                                research are related to the actual                                              realization of this match.                                                                                                                                      Adaptive neurocontrol, if fully                                                 developed, could be successfully                                                used in autonomous space                                                        explorations and robot planning,                                                high performance aircraft/missile                                               control, man-machine interaction,                                               the national aerospace plane, and                                               flexible structure control.  Two of                                             the above areas are proposed to be                                              used to test the concepts presented                                             in this proposal.  These are: (a)                                               adaptive control in man-machine                                                 interaction problems; and (2)                                                   robust adaptive control of a high                                               performance aircraft. It is                                                     anticipated that these applications                                             will bring out the essential                                                    features of the proposed immunized                                              adaptive neurocontrol approach.",
