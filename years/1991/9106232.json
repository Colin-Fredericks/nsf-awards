 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Washington will operate the R/Vs                         CLIFFORDA. BARNES and THOMAS G. THOMPSON during 1991 as general                 purpose oceanographic vessels in support of NSF-funded research                 projects. The R/V BARNES is a 65 foot general research vessel                   built in 1966, the R/V THOMPSON is a 274 foot general research                  vessel built in 1991. The BARNES is owned by the National Science               Foundation and operated by the University of Washington through a               charter party agreement with NSF. The THOMPSON is owned by the                  Navy and operated by the University of Washington through a                     charter party agreement with the Office of Naval Research.                                                                                                           These vessels are part of a fleet used by the National                     Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.                  Most oceanographic requires highly specialized equipment and                    extensive support from the ship's crew. An increasing number of                 research projects require specialized equipment installed on the                vessel and for which the ship has been specially designed. Such                 equipment requires highly specialized crew members for operation                and maintenance. The vessels do not operate in the same manner as               commercial cargo or fishing vessels, therefore NSF supports the                 operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to                     oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by                           universities and research institutions around the country.                                                                                                      The R/V BARNES operates primarily in the coastal waters of the                  northwest U.S. The R/V THOMPSON will operated as an all oceans                  vessel and will be operating out of foreign ports as required by                cruises. These vessels are capable platforms for these                          operations, and the University of Washington has maintained an                  excellent program at modest costs.",
