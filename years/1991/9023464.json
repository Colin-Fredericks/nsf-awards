 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. Susan Feigenbaum under the                   National Science Foundation's Faculty Awards for Women Scientists               and Engineers Program.  The objectives of this program are to                   recognize the nation's most outstanding and promising women                     scientists and engineers in academic careers in research and                    teaching, to retain them in academia, and to facilitate the further             development of their careers.                                                                                                                                   This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research                   agenda concerning the impact of institutional design on individual              and organizational behavior.  In particular, she will study                     institutional constraints facing economic researchers and examine               the resulting (dis)incentives to engage in careful quantitative                 analysis.  She will provide an in-depth theoretical and empirical               study of the \"market\" for (ir)reproducible statistical analysis.                It will evaluate the sufficiency of existing mechanisms to monitor              empirical work and propose alternative institutional responses.                                                                                                 Her topics to be studied include: (i) the impact of computing price             declines on the volume and complexity of data analysis, data                    availability, and replicability; (ii) the relationship between                  expositional quality and degree of replication, and their relative              importance in terms of journal acceptance; (iii) the effect of co-              authors and researcher specialization on the production of careful              research; (iv) differential incentives created by government versus             private funding mechanisms to promote research quality; (v) the                 role of the editorial process and peer review in assuring                       reproducible results; and (vi) the relative success of scientific               institutions in self-policing \"important\" disciplinary and policy               research discoveries.",
