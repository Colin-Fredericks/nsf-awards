 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Aided Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE)Center For                Electronic Packaging is presently an NSF/IUCRC, with an annual                  budget of over $900,000.  The activities of the  existing Center                will be expanded to conduct research and development of high                    volume, highly-reliable and internationally competitive commercial              electronic products.  The program will incorporate cost                         effectiveness, producibility and supportability as well as high                 reliability, into a concurrent product development process to                   enhance the economic development and competitiveness of the                     electronic industry in the United States.  Manufacturability,                   product yield, quality, reliability and life cycle costs will be                addressed concurrently during the design phase, and there will be               rapid transfer of improved methods, technologies and logistics into             product development.  To accomplish this, the Center research is                organized into four interdisciplinary research thrust areas, each               with defined core and non-core activities: (1) design development               for product performance; (2) product producibility and                          supportability; (3) life cycle modeling and assessment; and (4)                 experimentation and validation.                                                      The results will be transferred directly to the industrial                 members through developed software, guidelines and standards.  New              technologies will be incorporated directly into software through                improved algorithms and enhanced databases which will in turn aid               industry's capability to achieve designs for improved                           producibility, reliability and supportability.  Technology transfer             activities include workshops, short courses, training and                       consulting sessions at local community colleges and state-sponsored             organizations for small-business initiatives, in addition to                    current technology transfer activities at the CALCE Center and at               member sites.  The State of Maryland, industry and NSF will provide             matching funds totalling $750,000 in the first year.",
