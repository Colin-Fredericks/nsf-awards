 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cold Spring Harbor Symposia are held yearly at the beginning                of June at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor,               New York.  They bring together approximately 300-400 scientists                 from all over the world to present and evaluate new data and ideas              in rapidly moving areas of biological research.  Each year a topic              is chosen that seems to be at a stage where general and intensive               scrutiny and review is needed.  A Cold Spring Harbor Banbury                    meeting in 1988 set the stage for the subsequent merger of a wide               range of approaches to the cell cycle.  For the first time those                working on signal transduction, ascomycete genetics and marine                  invertebrates began to be able to talk in a common language.  This              followed the realization that several critical cell cycle                       regulators are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution.                       Following a period of remarkable unification, the cell cycle field              has now developed into one that attracts the attention of                       scientists from a variety of very different disciplines.                                                                                                        The 56th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium entitled The Cell Cycle is                designed to bring together those who work on aspects of signal                  transduction, mitotic control, mitosis, and DNA replication.  By                illustrating the very different approaches that are taken to a                  common problem, this Symposium will reinforce the interactions that             have recently brought this field such vitality.",
