 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large order eigenproblems arise in a variety of applications.  The              long computing times and large storage requirements of these problems           motivate development of fast serial and efficient parallel                      eigensolvers.  New numerical methods will be investigated for                   computing all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real unsymmetric                  tridiagonal matrices that arise in applications and from reduction of           general real matrices.  The immediate goal is to provide new methods            for the tridiagonal case.  Because current methods for the general              eigenproblem can suffer from parallel inefficiency or numerical                 instability, the larger goal is to develop accurate parallel methods            that might ultimately be extended to the general eigenproblem without           initial reduction to tridiagonal form.                                                                                                                          The research derives from methods that have been successful for the             symmetric tridiagonal eigenproblem.  The work will begin with a study           of parallel methods for computing eigenvectors of an unsymmetric                tridiagonal matrix given its computed eigenvalues.  It will continue            by developing divide and conquer methods to compute both eigenvalues            and eigenvectors of an unsymmetric tridiagonal matrix.  It will                 conclude with a mechanism for roughly locating the eigenvalues of any           tridiagonal matrix.  The latter technique is geared toward                      accelerating rootfinding methods for computing eigenvalues.  Serial             and parallel algorithms will be designed, implemented, and tested for           all approaches.",
