 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was made to support the foreign travel                               costs of eight U.S.resarchers to attend a NATO                                  Advanced Research Workshop (ARW) in Acquafredda,                                Italy.  The topic of the workshop is                                            \"Academic-Industry Relations.\"  The                                             P.I., Dr. Henry Etzkowitz, is responsible for                                   organizing attendance at and participation in the                               workshop by top American researchers in this field.                             The aims of the ARW are to exchange information and                             stimulate new research in the areas of:                                         organizational innovations in academic-industry R&D                             alignments; science and industrial policy                                       intersections in regional, newly industrializing,                               and post-socialist contexts; and development of                                 broadly accesible data bases for comparative                                    research.  The value of the workshop, which brings                              together researchers from all around the world, is                              to bring a large body of existing research results                              and knowledge to the attention of the most                                      pre-eminent investigators in the field of academic-                             industry research relations, revealing the                                      possibilities for combining their efforts                                       synergistically.  A great deal is already known,                                through experientially-based surveys and through                                structured, theory-based research studies, about how                            innovation occurs and knowledge is transmitted in                               academic-industry research interactions.  However,                              this body of knowledge has yet to be organized and,                             to the extent feasible, codified in ways that                                   would make it widely and easily accessible to the                               S&T community, both for implementation and further                              research.  Benefits to the U.S. will be in the                                  form of gaining knowledge of competing, and                                     different, approaches to university-industry                                    partnerships.",
