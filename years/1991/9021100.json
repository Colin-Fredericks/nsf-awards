 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns continuation of precise astronomical                measurements related to solar variability, the relation between                 solar activity and planetary weather, and variations in the                     transparency of the Earth's atmosphere.  New evidence for a                     relationship between solar output and planetary \"weather\" comes                 from the planet Neptune, whose global albedo has indicated cyclic               variations associated with solar cycle.  Telescopic and Voyager                 spacecraft images combined with photometry relate the brightness                variations to transiting stratospheric clouds of frozen methane.                This work will include further multispectral continuum and                      methane-band photometry and collaborative infrared imaging of                   Neptune, plus comparative measurements of Titan and Uranus which                also vary in brightness during solar max 91, to test competing                  solar-weather theories involving UV driven photochemistry and                   cosmic-ray induced nucleation.  A series of indirect solar                      brightness measurements derived from photometry of the Galilean                 satellites of Jupiter will also be completed.  The 1976-1992                    photometry encloses the 1980-1989 era of precise solar radiometry               by the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) and will test the veracity of                a reported 0.4% solar brightness increase between 1976 and 1978.                Finally, using multicolor nighttime stellar and daytime solar                   photometry, a long series of aerosol and ozone extinction                       measurements will be made to look for systematic trends and                     diurnal variations.",
