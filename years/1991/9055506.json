 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a 40-month leadership teacher enhancement project                       which targets teachers from rural public and private schools                    near Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Two teachers (one K-3, one 4-6)                      from each of 35 schools will receive three years of training                    in content and methodology, and in strategies for leadership                    and inservicing.  Their respective principals will                              participate in planning science inservices, and the PI will                     provide support through 2 site visits/teacher/year and an                       800 hotline, as well as through program workshops.  At the                      end of three academic years, 595 teachers will have been                        involved in substantive inservicing supported by                                administration and principals, and by the PI.  Urban                            teachers from Fort Wayne, who have just completed a similar                     project, will serve as mentors to the rural teachers.                                                                                                           The 70 leader teachers will be involved in a three year                         program that includes summer workshops as well as monthly                       academic year inservices.  Urban teachers from Fort Wayne                       schools who participated in the P.I.'s previous grant                           project, will share their experiences with the participants                     of this project, establising partnership relationships                          between these urban and rural school teachers.  The leader                      teachers and their principals will plan inservice programs                      for teachers in their respective schools (595 teachers), and                    will be supported directly by the PI and project staff.  The                    project design plans for extensive direct involvement on the                    part of the P.I. and project staff, maximizing the project's                    potential for significant positive impact on science                            education in the targeted schools.                                                                                                                              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because it contains both a strong enhancement                           program and a carefully planned and well-supported                              leadership component that is designed to reach all of the                       classroom teachers in the schools of the leader teachers.                                                                                                       Cost sharing is approximately 66% of the amount requested                       from NSF.",
