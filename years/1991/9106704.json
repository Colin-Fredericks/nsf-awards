 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will exploit a unique developmental system in which               isolated mesophyll cells differentiate synchronously to form                    tracheary elements.  Tracheary elements are characterized by                    distinctly patterned secondary walls, but it is not known how                   wall deposition and patterning are controlled.  Prior results                   demonstrated requirements for calcium sequestration and transport               before and during wall deposition, thereby providing the first                  evidence for a regulatory ion the might coordinate diverse events               in cell wall deposition.  These and other results will be                       extended in three directions: (1) Determination of which events                 in wall deposition are regulated by calcium; (2) Determination of               how wall patterning is controlled, particularly in regard to                    self-determining interactions of wall components; and (3)                       Characterization of a plasma membrane associated protein                        associated with cell wall patterning.  The research will use                    modern cytochemical, spectroscopic, and molecular biological                    techniques for molecular dissection of cell wall structure and                  control of patterning.  It will represent the first attempt to                  obtain a molecular understanding of the temporal and spatial                    control of synthesis of cell wall tracheary elements, which are                 classical specimens in plant developmental biology and have a                   significant role in plant adaptation.",
