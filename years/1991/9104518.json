 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator and his                         colleagues will continue their research on various aspects of                   applied mathematics, numerical analysis and fluid dynamics.  In                 particular, they will conduct analytical, numerical and                         experimental studies of viscous flows with free boundaries and                  viscous flows inside pipes and channels, a variety of water wave                problems and the behavior of waves on sloping beaches.  And they                will perform theoretical analyses of numerical techniques like                  multi-grid methods that are so essential in resolving fluid                     phenomena that are beyond the present capabilities of analysis                  and experimentation.                                                                 The study of fluid dynamical phenomena provides a challenge                to applied mathematicians because so much of the work involves an               interplay among the three basic techniques of mathematical                      analysis, numerical computation and laboratory experimentation.                 Given the interdisciplinary nature of the subject it is essential               for applied mathematicians to collaborate with experimentalists                 and computational scientists, in order to tackle successfully                   difficult and important problems involving fluid flow.  In this                 project the principal investigator has assembled the perfect team               consisting of fluid dynamicists. numerical analysts and                         experimentalists.  Their goal is to continue their important work               on understanding and quantifying the fluid dynamics of viscous                  flows and water waves.",
