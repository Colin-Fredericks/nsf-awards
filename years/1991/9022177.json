 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the present study is to investigate the nature and                  magnitude of the genetic response to superoxide-,mediated stress                in the fungus Neurospora crassa.  The emphasis of the study will                be on genes for superoxide dismutase and anonymous genes that are               induced in response to superoxide generating agents.  Specific                  goals are to:(1) Continue analysis of the function and regulation               of the gene for N. crassa cytosolic CuAn superoxide dismutase                   (sod-1), which we have recently cloned and sequenced.  Recently                 constructed sod-1 mutants will be studied to determine the                      importance of CuZn SOD for the aerobic growth and reproduction of               N. crassa .  Regulation studies will examine the extent to which                this gene and the gene (s)  for MnSOD (see below) are induced in                response to conditions of oxidative stress.  In addition, in                    vitro and in vivo studies will investigate the significance of                  sequences hypothesized to be important for sod-1 expression. (2)                Construct sublcones of the recombinant plasmid carrying the gene                for N. crassa MnSOD (currently identified as a 6 Kbp HindIII                    fragment in a 40 kbp cosmid clone) and create and characterize                  mutations in this gene using RIP-mediated disruption.  These                    mutant strains, when considered along with sod-1 mutants, will                  permit genetic and physiological studies of the importance,                     function and evolution of superoxide dismutases.  (3) Perform                   preliminary experiments toward assessing whether there exists a                 global superoxide (Sox) response in ascomycetous fungi, similar                 to that recently proposed for E. coli.  We will employ                          physiological studies of induced resistance to superoxide stress                and genetic studies of anonymous superoxide-induced genes in N.                 crassa., identified by differential screening with labeled cDNAs.",
