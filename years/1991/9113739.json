 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the early 1980s, unauthorized immigration has increased in                the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, a function of renewed             economic growth coupled with severe restrictions on new legal                   immigration.  Millions of illegal aliens have migrated to these                 countries.  In Western Europe, international labor migration is                 largely unregulated.  In the United States, the 1986 U.S.                       Immigration Reform and Control Act has not only failed to deter                 much new unauthorized immigration and to increase the propensity                of illegal aliens already in the country to depart, but has also                stimulated additional illegal immigration.  The European Economic               Community have characterized immigration as \"the big issue of the               1990s.\"                                                                                                                                                         This project is a comparative assessment of recent immigration                  flows, public policies to reduce unauthorized immigration, and the              outcomes of these policies in advanced industrial or post-                      industrial societies.  A systematic examination of the experiences              of advanced industrial nations (United States, Canada, France,                  Belgium, Italy, Germany, and Japan) in attempting to gain control               over illegal immigration from less developed countries and regions              (primarily Mexicao, North Africa, Turkey, Eastern Europe, the                   Philippines and Bangladesh) will be conducted.  Alternative                     theories and explanations for the persistence of low-skilled                    immigration and for the limited efficacy of immigration control                 measures in labor-importing countries will be evaluated.                        Activities will include the formation of a multidisciplinary                    research group consisting of seven immigration specialists                      (representing sociology, economics, political science,                          anthropology, and history) from various universities who will                   conduct primary data collection.  These researchers and other                   leading immigration specialists from other industrialized countries             will meet in 1993 for a workshop to discuss the work.                                                                                                           The results of this study will have significant value for                       scientific and policy analyses of international labor migration.                In addition, the research has both transnational and international              theoretical implications relating to other issues in the sociolegal             field such as the limits of law as a regulatory mechanism, the                  problems of implementation, and the relationship of public                      attitudes to legal outcomes and effectiveness.",
