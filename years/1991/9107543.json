 "awd_abstract_narration": "Population dynamics is considered to be the demographic summation               of individual attempts to maximize evolutionary fitness, measured               as lifetime reproductive success (LRS).  Many offspring disperse;               therefore, reproductive success of parents cannot be determined                 without knowing the survivorship and reproductive output of their               dispersing offspring.  An animal should not disperse unless                     dispersal increases its fitness; therefore, dispersal must be                   considered from the fitness viewpoint of dispensers.  The                       contributions of dispersal, social behavior, individual                         differences, and social organization to fitness can be determined               from detailed, longitudinal, long-term studies of individuals                   whose life-history traits of relatedness, age, and sex are known,               whose behavioral phenotype can be categorized, and whose social                 interactions can be directly observed.  This project will be the                first to incorporate the reproductive success of offspring into                 the calculations of the variance in lifetime reproductive success               of individual males and females.  The energetic costs of male                   mating strategies will be compared with the reproductive costs of               females to determine which sex, if either, has the greatest costs               during the active season.                                                                                                                                       Many rodent populations require control.  When population control               should be applied to be cost effective can be determined from the               population biology of the species.  Thus, if most animals that                  disperse die, then it is not effective to apply control measures                to animals that would die anyway.  Also, control measures are                   ineffective if those animals that are killed or removed are                     quickly replaced by immigrants.  Because yellow-bellied marmots                 frequently are agricultural pests, knowledge of the fate of                     dispensers will contribute to the preparation of effective                      control measures.",
