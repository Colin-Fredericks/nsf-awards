 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little is know about how hybrid plants and zones affect                    herbivore distributions and evolution.  Studies of insects on                   cottonwoods by these investigators demonstrated that hybrids                    should no longer be treated as anomalies and that fundamentally                 important interactions occur in these zones of unparalleled                     genetic variability.  The proposed work will continue these                     studies to address 3 major hypotheses that have far reaching                    implications for understanding plant-herbivore interactions.                    First, are natural plant hybrid zones focal points of insects                   biodiversity?  If true the loss of these zones may results in the               extinction of many insect species.  Because the Endangered                      Species Act of 1973 does not protect hybrid plants, studies of                  this issue are important from both basic and applied                            perspectives.  Second, do natural plant hybrid zones act as                     bridges that facilitate insect and pathogen host shifting?                      Hybrid intermediates may be used by insects as stepping stones to               gradually shift from one plant species to another.  If true, this               process would represent a fundamentally new view of how insects                 and pathogens host shift.  Third, does the presence of                          susceptible hybrids affect insect evolution and perhaps even                    prevent them from becoming adapted to resistant host plants?                    Here the investigators will examine the implications of mixed                   resistance and susceptibility in plant populations as it might                  affect insect evolution.  This question has important                           implications for understanding insect distributions and could                   affect insect management practices.  This research will provide                 an important contribution to the overall understanding of hybrid                zones, potentially extremely important habitats in the evolution                and ecology of plants herbivores insects.",
