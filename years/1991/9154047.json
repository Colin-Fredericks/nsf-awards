 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Illinois will receive a planning grant                   for an evaluative study of the nine NSF Middle School Teacher                   Preparation Projects.  These five-year projects were funded in                  1986 as the result of a special program solicitation targeting                  the preparation of teachers of mathematics and science for the                  middle school level.  These projects have prepared a new                        generation of middle school teachers, have created courses and                  materials for middle school teacher preparation, and have                       greatly added to our knowledge base about the preparation of                    middle school mathematics and science teachers.  Therefore, it                  is important that these projects be carefully documented and                    evaluated, and the results be disseminated.  This planning                      grant will immediately begin to lay the groundwork for the                      evaluation activities while the projects are still active.",
