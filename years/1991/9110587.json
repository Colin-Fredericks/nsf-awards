 "awd_abstract_narration": "North-central Nevada contains one of the largest gold-                     producing districts in the world Sixty million ounces of gold                   (Knutsen and Wilson, 1990) have been identified in \"Carlin-Type                 \"deposits in the Carlin trend, one of several mineralized trends                in the district.  The fundamental relationships between igneous                 and tectonic activity in this region have yet to be fully                       understood.  An important consequence of crustal processes active               in this region is the massive concentration of gold.  By resolving              those processes responsible for gold concentration we can formulate             models describing ore genesis in Carlin-type deposits and improve               our understanding of geological processes active along this ancient             continental margin.  This research proposal outlines a detailed                 fluid inclusion study to determine the pressure-temperature                     conditions during gold precipitation at the Getchell deposit, a                 typical Carlin-Type system, and to document the physical and                    chemical nature of fluids that transported and precipitated gold                mineralization.",
