The meeting is organized               in the U.S. by Professor Curtis Frank of Stanford's Department of               Chemical Engineering and Dr. Elsa Reichmanis of AT&T Bell Labs.                 A similar number of Australian scientists will attend with support              from the Australian Department of Trade, Industry and Commerce,                 organized by Professor James O'Donnell of the Department of                     Chemistry, University of Queensland.  Additional participants from              industry and third countries will attend with non-NSF means of                  support.                                                                        Over five days of meetings, the participants will discuss the way               in which radiation affects the physical, chemical and engineering               properties of polymers, a topic of great importance to the                      electronics and space industries of the U.S. and Australia.",
