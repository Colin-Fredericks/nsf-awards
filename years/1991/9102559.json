 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colloids have been suggested to play critical roles in the marine               geochemical cycling of elements which form hydrolysis products,                 including A1(III), Fe(III), and Th(IV).  Complexation of metals                 by organic ligands in the colloidal size range may also be                      important for elements such as Cu(II) and Zn(II).  Due to their                 function as required micro-nutrients, accurate information is                   needed on the speciation of Fe, Cu, and Zn (and other trace                     elements as well) in order to ultimately understand how this                    speciation is related to productivity and nutrition in the ocean.               The very large surface/volume ratio of colloidal hydroxides may                 also affect the geochemistry of other particle-reactive elements.               Colloids in the ocean could come from multiple sources, including               river/estuarine transport, hydrolysis of Al and Fe released from                aerosols, and production of high molecular weight organic ligands               by marine microbes.  This work involves an initial series of                    experiments designed to investigate these multiple sources of                   colloidal material and to determine whether, and under what                     conditions, colloidal trace metals are a significant fraction of                the total \"dissolved\" pool of trace metals in the oceans.                       Samples from estuarine, coastal, and open-ocean waters will be                  collected using stringent anti-contamination methods and                        processed using cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFF).",
