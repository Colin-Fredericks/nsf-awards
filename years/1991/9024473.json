 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of sacrificial layers is a integral part of                             surface micromachining technology.  Currently,                                  silicon dioxide is the most widely used sacrificial                             layer material.  However, since hydrofluoric acid is                            needed to remove oxide sacrificial layers, many                                 acid-sensitive metals such as aluminum and                                      chromium are not compatible with surface                                        micromachining schemes.                                                                                                                                         Phase I studies demonstrated that a new family of                               sacrificial layers materials termed alkali-soluble                              polyimides, or ASI's can be used to fabricate metal                             microdevices without the usual problems of metal                                attack.  ASI's were originally developed as                                     improved lift-off coatings for integrated circuit                               manufacturing processes.  They exhibit excellent                                high temperature stability an chemical resistance                               and, most importantly, they can be removed by                                   mild, noncorrosive enchants.  Removal occurs                                    rapidly without attendant swelling that can                                     jeopardize the integrity of overlying structures.                                                                                                               Phase II will investigate the basic relationships                               between polymer structure, etch bath chemistry,                                 and a host of processing variables to understand                                how they control the behavior of ASI materials.                                 The knowledge base will be invaluable for                                       developing successful ASI-based sacrificial layer                               products during Phase III.  These new products are                              expected to become an important part of the                                     polyimides business which is currently serving the                              microelectronics and optoelectronics industries.",
