 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports two cultural anthropologists and a Nepalese               colleague in a study of how women in Nepal criticize their                      subjugated position in society through the medium of songs sung                 at a traditional festival.  Major socio-cultural changes are                    occurring now in Nepal and the project will study the production                of novel songs of critical social commentary as they are sung at                the festival.  Methods include participant observation, extensive               interviews of women and of men, and examination of printed                      songbooks.  The research focus is to understand the micro-process               by which gender relations in a patriarchal society are changing.                                                                                                This research is important because patriarchal social systems                   exist in most traditional societies, and are faced with severe                  pressures for more egalitarian social relationships (e.g., the                  recent complaint of middle-class Kuwaiti women about their                      inability to legally drive their families out of war danger due                 to the Muslim prohibition on woman drivers).  Understanding how                 gender relations are protested in traditional discourse in one                  case will help us understand the general processes of social                    change in gender relations in traditional societies.",
