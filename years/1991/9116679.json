 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Carolina State University and North Carolina A&T State                    University are jointly establishing the NSF/AEMP Interinstitutional             Fellowship Program.  The primary objective of the proposed program              is to increase the number of African-Americans pursuing doctorates              in engineering and qualifying for academic and research careers.                A secondary objective is to establish a model for similar programs              at other universities.  In brief, the program will provide                      approximately eight full fellowships for minority, women, or                    disabled students, but focusing initially on African-American                   students.  The program will provide full fellowship support during              the first, second, and fifth years of doctoral study (following the             BS) and research assistantships and supplementary fellowships                   during the third and fourth years.  The program will also provide               full payment of tuition and fees and funds in support of                        publication preparation, travel, and minor equipment purchases by               fellows for up to five full years of study.  Important components               of the program are to make doctoral study more attractive and to                accelerate progress toward the degree by providing full support                 during the time when a student is preparing for research and                    afterward, when the student is writing the dissertation.  During                the research phase the student would receive support as a graduate              research assistant supplemented by a reduced fellowship stipend.                This would allow the student, during this period, to concentrate                fully on completing the research requirements associated with the               PhD degree.",
