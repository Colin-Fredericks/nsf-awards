 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polyploidy in higher animals is generally rare, but more                   than fifteen species of five different families of frogs and                    toads have been discovered.  The subjects of this research are                  two widely ranging North American gray treefrogs - the polyploid                species Hyla versicolor, a tetraploid (2 times normal chromosome                number) and its diploid counterpart, h. chrysoscelis.  The main                 goal is to learn if H. versicolor arose more than once from H.                  chrysoscelis or as a hybrid between ancestral h. chrysoscelis and               another diploid, h. avivoca.  The multiple-origin hypotheses                    will be tested by comparing the nucleotide sequences of                         mitochondrial DNA from frogs of all three species from widespread               areas through their distribution.  The hypothesis of multiple-                  origin will be supported if in an evolutionary tree based on                    sequence data, different populations of H. versicolor occupy                    different branches.  In other words, the two species in the same                area of the range would be more similar to each other than                      individuals of the same species from different parts of the                     range.  A second goal is to compare differences in the acoustic                 properties of the mating calls of H. versicolor and H.                          chrysoscelis in areas where they occur together (sympatry) with                 differences between areas where only one species occurs                         (allopatry).  Because the frogs use mating calls alone to                       identify correct mates, and because mismatings lead to sterile,                 triploid hybrids, the working hypothesis is that differences                    within sympatry will be greater than differences between                        allopatric populations.",
