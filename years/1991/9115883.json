 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this award is to support the development of a                    strategic plan for the College of Engineering at Southern                       University.  Southern University is a historically black                        institution (HBCU) challenged with educating minority engineers.                Presently, Black Americans are underrepresented in the engineering              population and it has been projected that the future supply of                  engineers will be less than the anticipated demand.  Standard                   methodology similar to that certified by the American Association               of School Administrators/National Academy of School Executives will             be used for the development of the strategic plan.  This strategic              plan is necessary to guide Southern University and its College of               Engineering toward increasing the supply of minority engineers                  throughout this decade and into the next century.",
