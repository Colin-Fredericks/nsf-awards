 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1991 symposium will be the twenty-fourth in an annual                  series.  It will be held in San Antonio, Texas in August, and its               theme is Theoretical Approaches for Predicting Spatial Effects in               Ecological Systems.  Topics included are the use of diffusion                   based models to predict the movement and distribution of animal                 populations, the use of renormalization theory to develop scale-                independent spatial models, non-linear Markov models for                        simulating landscape changes, the development and application of                spatial ecosystem models for estimating long-term ecological                    effects, the effect of economic policies on the spatial patterns                of land-use, and the use of percolation theory to examine the                   effects of spatial heterogeneity.                                                    The overall goal of the symposium is to expose biologists to               recent theoretical work by mathematicians, and to expose                        mathematicians to some of the key problems and constraints faced                by ecologists in the analysis and simulation of ecological                      systems.",
