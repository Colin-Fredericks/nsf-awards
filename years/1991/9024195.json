This equipment is maintained for use on or in association                       with the R/V WECOMA, a research vessel owned by the NSF                         and operated by the University.  A substantial part of the                      ship's operating schedule during 1991 is in support of                          NSF-sponsored research projects.  The instrumentation will                      also increase the capabilities of the ship and of the                           University to support research and engineering activities.                      The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                                   -CTD sensors, pressure gauges, and other enhancements for                        obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and                        temperature as a function of depth,                                            -an upgrade for an autoanalyzer that measures a variety of                        chemical constituents in seawater, and                                        -a large volume pump and filtration system for making a                          variety of biological and chemical measurements at sea.                                                                                                        The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored                           research and engineering projects.",
