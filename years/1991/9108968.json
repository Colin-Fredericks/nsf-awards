 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most microbes live in a world that is limited by the very                  nutrients that are required for their growth and replication.  In               response to the harsh conditions of  most natural environments,                 bacteria have adopted numerous strategies for survival.  One                    solution that appears to be quite common is that of                             miniaturisation, and in fact, most of the microorganisms seen in                marine and soil samples tend to be smaller than those capable of                growth in the laboratory.  At the very end of the size spectrum                 are marine bacteria that are known by various names, but which                  are frequently referred to as \"ultramicrobacteria\" due to their                 especially small size.  These bacteria may well represent the                   lower limit of cellular life, since the amount of genetic                       material (DNA) that they contain per cell is much less than that                typically seen in other bacterial cells.  This proposal is a                    first step in testing whether the ultramicrobacteria represent a                physiological group distinct from the larger marine                             microorganisms or are simply members of this group of larger                    bacteria that have adopted a miniature size for survival.  In                   order to determine the evolutionary relationships among these                   organisms, the total marine microbe population will first be                    separated into various size classes by filtration.  The DNA from                each size class will be isolated and compared to that from the                  other filters using short radioactively labeled fragments of RNA                to determine the diversity of species that comprise the                         ultramicrobacteria.  The experiments will utilize probes produced               from known marine bacteria and from species of any                              ultramicrobacteria that are capable of growing in pure culture.                 The initial research will focus on developing protocols to                      successfully prepare pure chromosomal DNA from the marine                       microbes captured on the filters.  Later studies will test the                  ability of the various probes to recognize and bind to the DNA in               the samples.",
