 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of forward genetics to study development has given us                   profound insights into how genes act to shape the body plan of a                multicellular organism as it develops from a fertilized egg. So                 far, however, this approach has only been extremely successful                  with invertebrate organisms, particularly Drosophila. The goal of               the proposed research is to develop and apply genetic techniques                to identify genes that play critical roles in the early                         development of a vertebrate animal, the zebrafish, Brachydanio                  rerio. Dr. Hopkins plans to mutagenize fish and examine their                   progeny for developmentally interesting early mutants. She will                 try to develop techniques for mutagenesis by DNA insertion so                   that mutated genes can be cloned easily, however, she will also                 work towards, and will probably begin screens, using gamma ray or               chemical mutagenesis. The advantages of the zebrafish for genetic               analysis were recognized by Streisinger some years ago, but only                recently has the potential of the zebrafish for the genetic study               of early development begun to be widely recognized.",
