 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates award will                    support ten students engaged in a nine-week program of research                 spanning a broad spectrum of the mathematical frontier.  The                    grant continues REU support based on a plan of broad faculty                    involvement and problem selection.  Each student will be involved               in one of four possible research areas, with between one and                    three students working in each area.  Past experience at many REU               sites indicates that students are unsure of their own interests                 and profit from learning specifics from several faculty advisors.               The advisors will be joined by faculty from Florida A&M                         University.                                                                          Mathematical areas will include the study of fundamental                   groups and covering spaces.  Using algebraic and topological                    techniques efforts will be made to construct covering spaces of                 various manifolds.  Work will also be done using an interactive                 graph program to study mapping properties of complex functions as               representations of idealized flows.  Modern game theory will be                 employed to study conditions under which noncooperative games                   have cooperative solutions.  Studies on dynamical systems will                  focus on discretizations of the barotropic vorticity equation of                fluid dynamics.                                                                      There will be several other scholarly activities on the                    campus at the same time as this project.  The opportunities for                 mixing among students in different disciplines will create a                    stimulating environment.  Joint social events are planned.",
