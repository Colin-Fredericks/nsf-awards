Pilot work supports the view that syntactic processing is                       \"informationally encapsulated\" in that certain types of                         information fail to influence or guide syntactic processing, even               in contexts where such information may be useful.  Such                         encapsulation allows for a computationally efficient parse (in                  linear time).                                                                        Specifically there is a sharp contrast between the                         utilization of information such as category, subcategory, number,               and case specification and information such as animacy and                      abstractness features.                                                               The investigators will use four experimental tasks:  (i)                   lexical decision (Wright & Garrett 1984); (ii) Word-by-word                     syntactic decision (Stowe 1989); (iii) word-monitoring (Marslen-                Wilson & Tyler 1980), and (iv) the probe task.  Both the word-by-               word syntactic decision task and the word-monitoring task involve               problems which limit their usefulness in experiments attempting                 to shed light on the issue of encapsulation.                                         The issue of encapsulation is related to the issue of                      computational efficiency because the domains in which concord                   relations are established varies from feature to feature.  The                  probe task will be used to investigate the role of the c-command                domain in syntactic processing.                                                      In general, the aim is to conduct experiments which pilot                  work indicates will support a particular view of human sentence                 comprehension, i.e. the process of human sentence comprehension                 distinguishes the use of lexically-specified and general                        syntactic information from the use of semantic or pragmatic                     information, even when syntactic information is ambiguous.",
