 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is widespread consensus on the crises in science                          education.  Too few students, particularly minorities and                       women, are graduating with science degrees.  Furthermore,                       students who take science courses frequently find them                          unengaging and they fail to understand concepts and underlying                  principles that represent scientific phenomena. This project                    proposes to develop a prototype, interactive multimedia system                  for introductory college chemistry using state of the art                       technology.  With this prototype, we will develop an initial                    unit on chemical equilibrium that will allow the user to                        operate on chemical systems and observe the results in                          integrated, multiple, simultaneous representations, including:                  chemical symbols, video of the reaction, molecular-level                        animations, dynamic graphs, displays of absorption spectra, pH                  graphs, and tabular data. The software and supporting materials                 will be designed to make the large lecture more interactive and                 engaging and to help students develop multiple, integrated,                     mental models of chemical phenomena.  We will examine the                       impact of the system on student understanding of and interest                   in science.  A subsequent comprehensive proposal will extend                    this environment to the entire introductory chemistry course.",
