 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Michael E. Silver of the Chemistry Department, Hope                         College, is being supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                 Organometallic Program for work on the synthesis and                            characterization of early transition metal allyl compounds.                     Specifically, compounds containing the moiety Cp(allyl)M, where                 M=Zr or Hf, will be synthesized.  The allyl ligand will be                      methylated to improve stability of the product.  The compounds                  prepared will then be used to synthesize early-late transition                  metal bimetallic compounds.  In one attempt, the Grignard                       reagent prepared from the allyl species will be reacted with                    late transition metal carbonylates.  In another, late metal                     hydrides will be used.  The allyl species will also be used to                  study fluxionality of the allyl group.                                          %%%                                                                             The goal of the research is to enhance the catalytic reactivity                 of the early transition metal center by associating it with a                   late-transition metal.  Although this strategy has not                          successed previously, positive results would have implications                  for the development of useful industrial catalysts.  It is                      anticipated that the project will result in the synthesis of                    novel organometallic species and the work will be of                            considerable educational value to the undergraduate students                    who will participate in the program.",
