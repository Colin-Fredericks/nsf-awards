 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ratio of root length to root dry weight (specific root length               SRL) varies widely among plant species.  Since water and nutrient               uptake is influenced more by root length than mass, species of                  high SRL may appear to invest their root biomass more efficiently               than species of low SRL.  A more complete cost-analysis, however,               must include the life-span of the root.  Species that construct                 fine roots (high SRL) may tend to proliferate roots in favorable                volumes of soil and shed roots in unfavorable soil volumes more                 readily than species with coarse roots (low SRL).  Thus, the                    short-term efficiency of high SRL roots may be offset by higher                 costs associated with higher root turnover rates.  This proposal                tests the relationship of SRL to root plasticity and root life-                 span by using a microvideo camera inserted into transparent tubes               buried in the ground in the field.  A citrus rootstock trial,                   with genetically diverse root systems grafted to genetically                    identical shoots, will serve as the model plant system.                                                                                                         This study will provide information on factors that influence                   root death and turnover as well as insights into how                            interspecific differences in root characteristics may influence                 nutrient and water acquisition, root turnover, and, ultimately,                 plant productivity.  In plant breeding, selection based on                      specific root traits is seldom undertaken.  While the citrus                    rootstock trial serves as an excellent model system with which to               examine basic relationships between root characteristics and root               turnover rates, the information gained also has direct practical                applications, since the rootstocks in the study are all of                      economic importance.  Additionally, this information will be                    valuable for ecosystem models that are being used to help                       estimate global climate change, since root turnover is a major                  source of carbon dioxide efflux into the atmosphere.",
