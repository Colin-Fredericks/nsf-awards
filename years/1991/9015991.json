 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually every animal and plant species exhibits genetic                       variation for a variety of enzymes involved in the control of                   metabolism.  Only a few studies have clearly established the                    relationships among genetic variation for a specific enzyme                     (genotype), the mechanistic, biochemical expression of that                     variation, a nd its relevance to the physiology and phenotype of                the whole organism.  A more integrated approach to examine the                  biological significance of genetic variation for a single enzyme                involves detailing the effects of that variation on the overall                 rate of energy flow through the metabolic pathway in which the                  enzyme is embedded.  The proposed research will use this approach               to attempt to establish a causal explanation for observations for               a strong relationship between genetic variation for a specific                  enzyme and production-related traits in the bay scallop.  The                   proposed mechanism which explains these observations involves the               genotype-dependent inhibition of the energy flow through the                    specific enzyme step and its associated metabolic pathway caused                by demands for increased energy flow through a competing pathway.               The proposed research will examine the expression of genetic                    variation at this enzyme step by using radioisotopes to measure                 the rates of flow through this enzyme as well as through its                    overall pathway when the enzyme is artificially inhibited with a                product from the competing pathway.  The results will be                        significance in areas as diverse as evolutionary biology and                    biochemistry to those concerned with the significance of genetic                variation to economically important traits such as aquaculture                  and agriculture.",
