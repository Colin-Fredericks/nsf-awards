 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will conduct research in the field of polymer                  processing, composites and rheology, specifically modeling and                  simulating processes such as injection, compression and resin                   transfer molding.  The outcome of this research will aid the                    designer in controlling material properties and part quality                    through innovative modeling, analysis and process simulation.                   Research will be done on the thermomechanical behavior of                       composites.  A major problem that arises when designing plastic                 parts, especially those made of fiber reinforced composites, is                 the change of the part's shape and dimensions due to shrinkage                  and warpage.  A thermomechanical simulation of the molding                      process of fiber reinforced composites will result from this                    research. Another study will determine the inertial effects                     during flow of low viscosity polymers.  This is especially                      interesting for the reaction injection molding (RIM) process                    where cycle times of only fractions of a second are sought.  It                 is not possible to predict flow patterns and orientations for                   this mold filling process using current simulations, since they                 are all based on the assumption of negligible inertia terms.  The               project will also develop a simulation of the thermoforming                     process of sheet materials, specifically, fiber matt preforms                   used in the resin transfer molding process and wood flour filled                polypropylene sheets used for interior body panels. It is                       important to know the filler orientation after forming and to                   detect the formation of folds or rips in the sheet which would                  make it unacceptable for use.                                                        Understanding the thermomechanical behavior of plastics and                being able to predict filling patterns, filler orientation,                     shrinkage, warpage and surface waviness before a part is actually               molded leads to higher part quality and eliminates some of the                  expensive and time consuming tasks done in the early stages of                  part and mold design.",
