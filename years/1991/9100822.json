 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight undergraduate students from the Southwest Rocky Mountain Region           will participate in a ten-week, comprehensive research experience at the        University of New Mexico during the summer of 1991.  In accordance with         his/her interests, each student will do one of the following: 1)                participate in the design, construction and operation of a small-scale          permeable barrier for groundwater aquifer remediation; 2) investigate           fracture in rock and concrete using laser interferometry; 3) conduct            nondestructive test methods on small structural components; 4) join in          an exciting development of a new fast-scan Scanning Electron Microscope;        5) design a Lunar optical telescope using interactive graphical                 analysis; 6) assist in an experiment to understand microcracking of             solids using a UNM x-ray device; 7) assist in numerical simulations of          granular soil using a discrete element model involving 2D discs and 3D          quartz spheres; and 8) study idealized failure profiles of soil-                structure interactions through video imaging.  Over half of the students        will be selected from applicants at institutions other than UNM,                especially those without active research programs.  Women, minority and         handicapped applicants particularly will be recruited.  The students            will become familiar with their projects through early contact with the         research faculty.  Each student can expect to learn to work quite               independently over the course of the summer, will present a final               seminar on the research, and will assist in writing a publication               describing the work.",
