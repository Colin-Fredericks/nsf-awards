 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics teaching is being improved by focusing laboratory                       activities on exploring and applying fundamental concepts                       rather than verifying known results, and by improving the                       quality and increasing the quantity and variety of data                         collected.  High quality graphical representations of data are                  being used; more powerful analytical and computational tools                    are being employed; and appropriate topics in the curriculum                    are being covered through experiments, numerical analysis and                   simulation.  Students are being involved in the solution of                     more realistic problems and being provided with resources to do                 so.To achieve these goals, the physics department is acquiring                  80386 based computers, VGA monitors, general purpose and motion                 sensing interfaces and sensors, and a file server, and is                       equipping and networking a number of data acquisition stations.                 Faculty are computerizing a number of current experiments and                   exploring others for possible computerization. The project is                   impacting initially all the freshmen and sophomore courses for                  both physical and life science majors, and will expand                          subsequently to all the students served by the department.NSF                   grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal                       sources.",
