 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goals of this research program are to characterize                  fully the molecular and gene structures and binding properties of               lectins from selected model invertebrates in order to understand                their evolution as recognition molecules and elucidate the                      molecular mechanisms of their biological functions.  During the                 past three years, with NSF support, four distinct L-fucosyl-binding             lectins have been isolated from the plasma of the protochordate,                C.picta, and the biochemical properties and binding specificities,              in addition to L-fucose, have been characterized.   C. picta                    lectins bind phosphocholine, galactan, and sialic and muramic                   acids.  Furthermore, by the use of monoclonal antibodies and                    conventional antisera developed against the purified proteins and               synthetic peptides, it was shown that those lectins are cross-                  reactive with mammalian acute phase reactants, in particular with               c-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid P (SAP) and coagulation                 factor VIII (F VIII).  Partial amino acid sequences have been                   determined for two of the lectins, and a peptide form one of the                lectins (CPL-I) has been characterized that exhibits high homology              to human F VIII.  A poly(A)+ containing RNA from hemocytes has been             isolated, double stranded cDNA synthesized, a library constructed               using the expression vector, lambda gt11, and twelve positive                   recombinant phage clones have been isolated.  Goals for the next                three years are:  1) to complete the amino acid and nucleotide                  sequences of both lectins to determine the extent of homology to                the acute phase proteins, CRP, SAP, and F VIII; 2) to develop                   probes required to identify and isolate genomic clones in order to              characterize the structure of their genes; and 3) to carry out                  studies to identify and characterize the interactions of C. picta               lectins with their putative natural ligands (exogenous or                       endogenous), in particular the bacterial community associated with              C. picta colonies and the tunic sulphated galactans.                                                                                                            Prior research from this laboratory has shown that the                          protochordates, tunicates, have carbohydrate-binding proteins                   (lectins) in their blood that resemble certain proteins found in                the blood of higher vertebrates, the so-called \"acute phase                     proteins\", that are thought to be components of a primitive defense             response.   The continuation of these molecular-level studies of                tunicate lectins will increase our knowledge of the physiology of               these interesting marine organisms and expand our understanding of              the origins of host defense mechanisms.",
