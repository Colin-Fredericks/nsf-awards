 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   program is made to Dr. Terrence J. Collins in the Chemistry                     Department of Carnegie Mellon University to continue work on                    coordination complexes containing transition metals in high                     oxidation states.  Collins has developed macroamide ligands                     which are not susceptible to oxidation and can be used to                       maintain Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni in unusual high oxidation states.                   Synthesis of additional compounds of this type will be                          attempted.  Depending on the metal and structure of the                         respective compound, it may serve as a model for methane                        monooxygenase, as an electrocatalyst or chemical sensor, a                      catalytic O-atom transfer agent, or exhibit antiferromagnetic                   coupling at low temperatures.  The compounds will be                            characterized using a variety of techniques, including electron                 paramagnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectroscopies, and cyclic                 voltammetry.                                                                                                                                                    The investigation will focus on four square-planar complexes of                 Mn(V) that are known, as well as 5- and 6-coordinate systems.                   Synthesis of nitrido analogs of some known manganese and iron                   compounds will be attempted.  Oxygen atom transfer reactions of                 Fe(IV), Ni(III), and Co(III) will also be investigated. The                     reaction chemistry of a stable Fe(IV)-O-Fe(IV) species, which                   is known to undergo three reversible oxidations, will be                        explored in detail. A detailed magnetic study will be                           undertaken of a linear polymer of antiferromagnetically coupled                 S=2 Mn(III) centers that shows unusual ferromagnetic                            interactions at low temperatures.",
