 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major issue that has arisen time and time again in managing the               environment is how to regulate emissions where there are                        potentially important irreversible environmental consequence and                where there is great uncertainty about the magnitude of the                     consequences.  The tension is often between controlling pollution               now in order to avoid potential irreversible effects, versus                    waiting to learn more about the potential irreversibilities and                 better mitigation technologies.  Global warming is the most recent              in a long series of environmental issues characterized by the                   debate of whether to take immediate action or wait until there is               more information.  Other recent environmental issues would include              acid rain and the use of pesticides and herbicides.  The purpose                of this research is to analyze the effect of the rate of learning               about a global warming, or alternatively about the rate at which                uncertainties about the problem a resolved, on optimal decisions                regarding emissions of greenhouse gases.  Various theoretical                   models will be developed and tested to answer this question,                    focusing on different ways uncertainty and learning can be                      represented.  While this project focuses on theory and in advancing             our understanding of these learning processes, an ultimate                      application of the research is in allowing the development of                   better policy models to help shape U.S. and world options and                   strategies for managing global warming.",
