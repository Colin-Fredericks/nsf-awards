 "awd_abstract_narration": "The analysis of mitochondrial mutations has been informative in                 several organisms, including yeast, fungi and humans.  The genetic              analysis of plant mitochondrial genomes has been limited due to the             fact that only a few mutations with known progenitors have been                 described.  We have focused on a set of lethal maize mutations                  (Nonchromosomal stripe; NCS) that survive in heteroplasmic plants.              Different NCS mutants are associated with distinct phenotypes and               the mutations have been shown to be deletions affecting the                     expression of a least three different mitochondrial genes (cox2,                nad4 and the co-transcribed S3 and L16 ribosomal protein genes.)                The major goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by               which the NCS lesions cause altered gene expression.  We will                   analyze the mutant and normal transcripts in NCS2 and NCS3 plants               and generate antibodies to determine whether the transcripts                    affected by NCS mutations are translated within nonmutant plant                 mitochondria.                                                                                                                                                   The long-term objective of this project is to understand the                    effects of individual plant mitochondrial genes on organelle                    biogenesis and overall cellular function.  The proposed studies                 should clarify aspects of transcriptional and post-transcriptional              regulation in plant mitochondria.  A second goal of this proposal               is to attempt to develop a system for demonstrating maize                       mitochondrial transformation using the NCS6 mutant, which carries               a partial deletion of the well-characterized cox2 gene.  The                    availability of a transformation system should facilitate studies               of putative regulatory sequences in plant mitochondria.***                           //",
