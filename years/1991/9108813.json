 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visual measurement of surface reflectance properties is an                 important issue both in basic and in applied computer vision                    research.  Surface reflectance gives a reliable cue for image                   segmentation and object recognition.  The goal of the proposed                  research is to detect and separate specularity from Lambertian                  reflectance based on physical models.  In order to provide enough               information to extract various properties of reflectance, we                    generally need more than one frame of images.  One direction is                 to use color information and another is to use multiple images                  with different views.  An algorithm for color image segmentation                and detection of specularity and inter-reflection is proposed.                  In addition to the use of color, the use of different views to                  differentiate specularity from Lamertian reflectance and to                     obtain object structure is proposed.  the proposed algorithm is                 based on the fact that the appearance of specularity varies                     depending on viewing direction while that of Lambertian does not.               In order to build a more robust and reliable vision system,                     information by color and multiple views will be integrated.  For                efficient processing of a large amount of spectral (color),                     temporal (multiple views) and spatial (image) data, parallel                    algorithms using a Connection Machine of 4K processors will be                  designed and implemented.  The high degree of computational                     parallelism will bring the algorithms into practical reality.",
