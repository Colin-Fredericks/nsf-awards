 "awd_abstract_narration": "SIMD (Single Instruction stream, Multiple Data stream) and VLIW (Very           Long Instruction Word) architectures have been successful as targets            for parallelizing compilers in large part because they resolve                  synchronizations statically, at compile-time, yielding zero run-time            cost for synchronization between processes.  However, since SIMD and            VLIW machines support only a single control flow thread, they cannot            execute distinct loops, conditional statements, subroutine calls, nor           even variable-time-instructions in parallel.  Hence, much program               parallelism must be ignored, and the resulting serialization of code            can dramatically reduce speedup and efficiency.  Recently, a new                architecture called barrier MIMD (Multiple Instruction                          stream, Multiple Data stream) architectures has been introduced as a            new parallel MIMD architecture that can retain the static scheduling            advantages of SIMD and VLIW, but also execute in parallel almost any            programming language construct.  The result is that a far larger                amount of program parallelism can be exploited by a parallelizing               compiler and efficiently executed on a barrier MIMD.  The objective of          this project is to improve and advance the compiler technology                  capable of exploiting barrier MIMD hardware.  Instruction and data              memory hardware designs which exploit static, compile-time knowledge            to dramatically increase barrier MIMD performance will also be                  investigated.",
