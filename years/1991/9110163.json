 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop polymers which                     will selectively bind specific metal ions from aqueous                          solutions containing many ions, and may be reversibly                           regenerated without creating additional ionic wastes.  A                        potential application of these polymers would be removal of                     heavy metal ions from aqueous waste streams.  The use of                        macrocytic ligands for the design of such polymers is                           investigated.  Polymer-bound crown ethers, coronands, podands,                  and cryptands characterized.  A series of experimental studies                  are performed to establish the optimal polymer design.                          Polymer structural features are characterized using 13C NMR,                    while NMR relaxational studies provide information about the                    microenvironment of the polymer-bound ligand.  A novel                          synthetic technique for producing polymer-bound pseudocrown                     ethers in situ during free radical polymerizations is also                      investigated.  Theoretical analyses including Monte Carlo and                   molecular simulations are performed to provide insight into                     the underlying interactions among the macrocytic ligands, the                   polymer backbone, and the ions.",
