Unfortunately, many                                                 geometries cannot be accurately                                                 modeled in two dimensions.  The                                                 step from two the three dimensions                                              is both computationally expensive                                               and analytically complex.  A                                                    traditional finite element                                                      formulation results in spurious                                                 solutions in three dimensions.  In                                              addition, the vector nature of the                                              fields makes the task of grid                                                   truncation very difficult.  The                                                 \"bymoment\" method has shown itself                                              to be an efficient technique for                                                grid truncation in a two                                                        dimensional finite element                                                      solution.  It is believed that many                                             of its advantages can be translated                                             to three dimensions.  In this                                                   project the \"bymoment\" method will                                              be extended to solve the problem of                                             electromagnetic scattering from                                                 three dimensional complex objects.                                              The development of such a technique                                             will provide solutions for many                                                 problems which are currently solved                                             by approximate techniques.  In                                                  addition, the development of a                                                  three dimensional scheme can lead                                               to applications for guided wave                                                 structures.",
