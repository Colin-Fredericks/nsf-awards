The initial                        observations involve two kinds of phenomena.  The first is modal                subordination; it appears that in order to capture the mood-                    Reference Time interaction in discourses involving this                         phenomenon, we must treat instants and intervals in a model as                  non-primitive, defined in terms of events (themselves conceived                 as partial possible worlds).  The second is the semantics of                    utterances which involve reference to times as well as modality,                including conditionals and counterfactual conditionals.  Such                   examples suggest further restrictions on the modeling of temporal               phenomena, including new insights into the cross-world status of                the notion of present, reflected in the notion of Speech Time,                  which is central to the interpretation of tense in a                            Reichenbachian approach, and in the lexical semantics of now and                other temporal indexicals.  The main goal of the research is to                 consider how to articulate the various restrictions with other                  considerations in the semantics of modal and temporal elements in               English.  The research bears as well on several open questions                  regarding the semantics of events and aspectual classes, the use                of partiality in semantic modeling, and the role of context in                  interpretation.",
