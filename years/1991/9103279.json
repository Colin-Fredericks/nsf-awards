 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal Dr. McCarty explores the regulatory mechanism                  which controls and integrates expression of diverse developmental               responses related to seed maturation in maize. Mutations in the                 Viviparous-1 (Vp-1) gene block much or all of maturation related                gene expression in embryo and aleurone tissues of the developing                seed. Two seemingly unrelated groups of genes are regulated by                  Vp1: 1) An embryo maturation set including various late                         embryogenesis abundant genes (LEA's) and the 7s globulin genes.                 These genes are also regulated by the hormone, abscisic acid. 2)                The second set includes the genes of the anthocyanin pathway. Dr.               McCarty has shown that Vp1 activates the anthocyanin pathway by                 activating a second regulatory gene, C1. Thus, these genes                      function as a regulatory hierarchy. His results suggest that Vp1                is a novel transcription factor. By expressing the Vp1 gene in                  maize protoplasts, he is able to characterize regulatory                        sequences involved in regulation of C1 and Em, a LEA gene of                    wheat. This system also provides a functional assay for the Vp-1                protein. His objectives are to 1) Determine how Vp-1 regulates                  transcription of target genes, 2) Use mutagenesis to define                     functionally important sequences in the Vp1 protein, 3) Identify                factors that interact with Vp1, 4) Characterize Vp1's role in                   development using ectopic expression and 5) Characterize                        transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of Vp-1                     expression.",
