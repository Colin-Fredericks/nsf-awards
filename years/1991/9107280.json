The purposes of the symposium are (a) to                   assess current challenges to the research systems of the major                  industrialized nations, (b) to compare national strategies for                  meeting these challenges, and (c) to explore options for the                    research systems of the 21st century.  Symposium speakers are                   senior government science policy officials and leading scientists               from the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom,             and the Soviet Union.  The symposium is a component of the                      comprehensive Roundtable program of activities focused on the                   current status of and future options for the academic research                  enterprise.  The proceedings of this symposium are being published              by the Research Roundtable in June, 1991.",
