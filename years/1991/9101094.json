 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continuing support to The Institute of                      Ecosystem Studies' Research Experiences for Undergraduates (IES-                REU) SITE.  The program will immerse students in a highly                       interactive, research oriented environment.  The major tenet is                 that success in science depends on understanding the context of                 research, as well as the substance and procedures of a particular               discipline.  Program goals are:  (1) to provide intensive                       training in ecological research; (2) to broaden students'                       perspectives on the societal, ethical and theoretical contexts of               science; (3) to give students direct exposure to the life of a                  research scientist; and (4) to promote an understanding of                      ecology.  Eight students will be brought to the Institute for a                 twelve-week program in each of the next three summers, building                 upon the strengths of the highly successful 1988-1990 programs.                 The program will include the following components:  (1) Student                 Research Projects; (2) Research Strategies for the Undergraduate,               a series of intensive training sessions; (3) Research in Context,               a seminar series designed to broaden students' perspectives  on                 the various components and applications of science; (4) Forum on                Opportunities in Ecology, a full-day program with representatives               from a broad spectrum of ecological and related disciplines; (5)                Ecology Seminars; and (6) a variety of other supporting                         activities.  Under the guidance of a mentor scientist, each                     student will delineate a research question and associated                       hypotheses, select appropriate methods, and develop a research                  plan.  Students will then implement the project, finishing with                 analysis and report writing.  Presentations in a formal Research                Symposium will conclude the summer program.  Final papers will be               collated and published as an IES Occasional Publication.",
