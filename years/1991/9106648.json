 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted on solvable statistical mechanical and               quantum field theoretical models.  Particular emphasis will be                  placed on the chiral Potts model.  The chiral Potts model has                   recently been solved for its eigenvalues and displays a number of               novel effects.  The model exhibits a commensurate-incommensurate                phase, the magnetic analog of optical activity and a Pokrovsky-                 Talapov transition.  Further studies will be undertaken of this                 class of exact level crossing transitions which may impact strongly             interacting fermion systems.  Order parameters and correlation                  functions in the incommensurate phase will be computed.  The                    results of this solvable level crossing system will be used to                  study more general non-integrable models.  More general integrable              models will be examined.  Connections with the mathematics of                   monopoles, algebraic geometry and topological field theory will be              explored.                                                                       %%%                                                                             The study of complex, interacting, many-particle systems lies at                the foundation of condensed matter physics and materials physics.               Because of the complexity of these systems, radical approximations              frequently need to be made in order to obtain solutions.  However,              occasionally a physical model, such as the Ising model, is able to              be solved exactly.  These exact solutions provide invaluable                    guidance to understanding the underlying physics and the                        mathematical structure of the exact model and related models.  The              chiral Potts model has recently been solved exactly and the                     proposed research will investigate the application of this model to             various classes of physical phemonena and further explore the                   nature of the solutions.",
