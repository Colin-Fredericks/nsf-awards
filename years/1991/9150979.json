 "awd_abstract_narration": "Specialized upper-division laboratories in fields of                            contemporary interest are an important component of a vital                     physics curriculum.  This Occidental College Physics Department                 project is developing two such laboratories in the areas of                     solid state and plasma physics. These laboratories, to be taken                 concurrently with lecture courses already offered by the                        department, complement the lecture presentation of particular                   topics as well as broaden the scope of these courses by                         introducing students to experimental techniques of the type                     used in current scientific research.In the solid state                          laboratory, students investigate important condensed matter                     phenomena such as resistivity, the polarity of charge carriers,                 the crystalline bandgap, electron-hole recombination, impurity                  doping of a semiconductor, and semiconductor statistics.  The                   experiments familiarize students with cryogenic techniques and                  introduce state-of-the-art instrumentation such as a lock-in                    amplifier, scanning monochromator and digitizing oscilloscope.                  Many of the experiments involve computer-controlled data                        acquisition and sophisticated data analysis schemes (e.g.,                      boxcar correlator).The plasma laboratory, the first of its kind                 at a small liberal arts college, is based on two custom made                    plasma-containment machines: the double plasma and the pure                     electron plasma devices. Through seven experiments, students                    explore single particle drifts, plasma wave dispersion and                      damping, plasma stability, and transport. Additionally,                         students become acquainted with vacuum technology and computer-                 controlled data acquisition/analysis techniques.NSF grant funds                 are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
