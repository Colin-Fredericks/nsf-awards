 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue an investigation on the major                   interactions between planktonic community structure and nutrient                cycling in aquatic ecosystems.  Because community composition is                tightly coupled with nutrient dynamics in a number of complex                   cause-effect relationships, the relative importance of different                interactions in any particular habitat can be difficult to                      assess.  For example, phosphorus fertilization, water column N:P                and planktivorous fish abundance may each independently influence               (directly or indirectly) phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance                and species composition.  The latter variables may, in turn,                    influence nutrient cycling rates and routes (either directly                    through water-column effects, or indirectly through sedimentation               and benthic regeneration).                                                           Three major variables can be experimentally manipulated to                 identify circumstances under which particular processes are                     important: the abundance of zooplanktivorous fish, the ratio of                 nitrogen to phosphorus available for uptake by phytoplankton,                   and the absolute amount of phosphorus added to the environment.                 Using a set of 16 large experimental ponds, researchers will                    manipulate two variables at a time with 4 replicate ponds per                   treatment.  At present, N:P (high vs low) and fish (presence vs.                absence)  are being manipulated.  This increment will be a                      further 1-year experiment to manipulate the third variable, P-                  loading (high vs. low) again + fish.  Research will contribute to               basic ecological concepts and will provide data useful in lake                  management.",
