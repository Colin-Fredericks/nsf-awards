 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many known examples of exclusion of bacteriophages by                 resident plasmids and prophages but the mechanisms underlying                   these exclusions are not known.  Experiments are proposed to                    study three exclusions: the exclusion of T4 by the lit gene                     product of the cryptic DNA element, e14; the exclusion of T4                    polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase deficient mutants by the prr               gene product of another cryptic DNA element; and the exclusions                 promoted by the rex gene products of the prophage.  We shall use                gene fusions to determine the mechanisms of the local and global                inhibition of gene expression promoted by the interaction between               the Lit protein and a short sequence within the major head                      protein gene of T4.  To explain the local inhibition the gol                    region may become a transcriptional terminator or target the RNA                for degradation in the presence of Lit protein.  The global                     inhibition may be due to the cleavage of an RNA or                              phosphorylation of a protein which is part of the translation                   apparatus.  Alternatively, it may be due to generation of a small               RNA or other inhibitor of translation.  Other experiments will be               directed toward determining the role of the prr and stp gene                    products as well as other auxiliary factors in the cleavage of                  host tRNA, and in searching for introns removed by the                          polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase.  Finally, a system we've                  devised for inducing the rex inhibitions in the absence of phage                superinfection will by used to find the primary target of the rex               gene products leading to the global inhibition of cellular                      functions.",
