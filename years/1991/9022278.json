 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protein kinase C (PKC) is an enzyme involved in mediating and                   regulating the actions of many neurotransmitters, hormones and                  growth factors.  Ubiquitously located in the body and mainly                    concentrated in the brain, protein kinase C is activated by                     second messengers, Ca2+ and diacylglycerol.  The activity of                    protein kinase C has been implicated in a number of neurological                functions such as neurite extension, regulation of ionic                        conductances and neurotransmitter release.  PKC exerts its                      effects on neuronal activity by attaching phosphate groups to                   substrate proteins.  The goal of this research project is to                    examine the mechanisms by which the enzyme regulates cell                       activity at the molecular level.  Three in vivo substrates will                 be characterized and identified by studying the pathway of PKC                  activation.  Dr. Scholz will utilize glutamate receptors to                     stimulate PKC phosphorylation.  Results from this study will                    provide additional information on the function of PKC in neuronal               development.",
