 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors H. T. Banks, K. Ito and C. Wang                  of the University of Southern California to continue their                      collaboration in applied mathematics research with Professor F.                 Kappel and others of the University of Graz and K. Kunisch of                   the Technical University of Graz, Austria.  They share interests                in control theory that focus on the problems of estimating                      parameters in partial differential equations from known                         observation of a given process and also the approximation of                    functional and partial differential equations stressing                         applications to control and inverse problems.  The specific                     topics on which they will work include modeling and parameter                   estimation techniques in size/age structured population models,                 the identifiability of parameters in models of visco-elastic                    systems, and the development of an approximation framework for                  nonlinear dynamics in a Banach space setting.                                                                                                                   These U.S. and Austrian mathematicians have been among the                      leaders in the development of methods and applications in a                     wide variety of problems in optimization, approximation and                     parameter estimation for functional and partial differential                    equations.  Their productive collaboration has already resulted                 in numerous publications containing applications to meaningful                  physical and biological problems.  The proposed work promises                   to continue this contribution by focusing on technically                        interesting problems with relevance to mechanics and population                 dynamics.",
