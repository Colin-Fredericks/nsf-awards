 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a U.S./Brazil collaborative                                 effort in biophysics between Wayne Reed of the                                  Physics Department at Tulane University, and Mario                              Politi and Iolanda Cuccovia of the Chemistry                                    Department at the University of Sao Paulo and Dino                              Zanette of the Federal University of Santa Catarina,                            both in Brazil.  The project will use the                                       Brazilians' expertise in synthetic chemistry and the                            American expertise in physical chemical                                         experimentation and theory to carry out                                         fluorescence-based measurements on a family of                                  important biological macromolecules                                             (glycosaminoglycans).  These experiments should                                 provide data on the electrophoretic mobility, self-                             diffusion and local electrostatic potentials of                                 these molecules.                                                                                                                                                The ultimate goal of the project is to relate                                   aspects of connective tissue biofunctionality, such                             as swelling pressure and compressibility, to the                                molecular properties of glycosaminoglycans.  This                               interdisciplinary effort will utilize synthetic                                 chemical strategies to produce physical probes of                               macromolecular behavior.  Data on such behavior can                             then be correlated with modern theories of                                      diffusion, electrophoresis and electro-                                         thermodynamics in polymer physics, with                                         structure/functional theories in macromolecular                                 biophysics, and with compressibility data and models                            in biomechanics.  They will also provide the basis                              and stimulus for the development of new models and                              theories in these interdisciplinary areas.",
