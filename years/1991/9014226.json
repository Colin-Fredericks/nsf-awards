 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in genetics                      between Dr. Janet Stavnezer, University of Massachusetts                        Medical School, and Dr. Eva Severinson, Department of                           Immunology, University of Stockholm, Sweden. The objective of                   the proposed project is to study the molecular basis of                         expression of \"genomic\" or \"sterile\" transcripts of                             \u001aunrearranged im\u001amunoglobin constant region genes. Such                         transcription has been demonstrated to be a prelude to                          immunoglobin class switching.                                                                                                                                   The ability of B cells to switch from production of one class                   of im\u001amunoglobin (Ig) to another is essential to the immune                     system, since different classes of Ig perform different                         functions. This process of class switching is highly regulated,                 as different classes are expressed in response to different                     antigens and at different sites in the body.  In this                           project, the investigators propose to study the regulation of                   production of sterile transcripts.   After determining the                      initiation sites for germline transcription of certain                          constant region genes and determining their promoters, the                      investigators will attempt to identify and characterize the                     DNA.binding proteins that bind to the promoter and then to                      obtain evidence of the roles these protein play in the                          regulation of such transcription.   Drs. Stavnezer and                          Severinson are leaders in the field of the analysis of class                    switching, the former in the molecular analysis of                              \u001atranscription and expression of constant region genes, and the                 latter in the study of the biological mechanisms of switching.                  The results of this research will make an important                             \u001acontribution to the understanding of the immune system.",
