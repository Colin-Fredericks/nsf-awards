 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most organic matter synthesized in surface waters of the sea is                 returned to inorganic constituents within the upper 500 m, or                   \"regeneration zone.\"  Oceanographers attribute these chemical                   transformations mostly to living organisms. Yet surprisingly                    little is known about the biology of remineralization below the                 euphotic zone:  whether the responsible organisms are                           dominantly metazoan or microbial and whether or not they occur                  on the larger particles that deliver material to depth.  Dr.                    Silver will conduct a 2-year study in Monterey Bay, and                         accessible, Comparatively deep water site, to study the role of                 both microbes and deep water site, to study the role of both                    microbes and zooplankton in the remineralization of particles                   >1mm. Using a combination of in situ observations and                           laboratory measurements, she will study both the abundant                       marine snow particles and very large aggregates (m size) that                   can serve as model systems for such studies.  She plans to (1)                  measure the size and abundance of the aggregates, (2) determine                 their chemical properties and associated living communities.                    (3) measure regeneration-related activities of the communities                  on the particles, and (4) compare and particle-related                          remineralization rates to those measured by sediment traps in                   the area.  For these measurements, she will use field surveys                   with a Romotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and a Marine Snow                        Camera, a variety of sampling devices operated from the ROV,                    and a series of experiments on natural samples incubated on                     shipboard and in the laboratory.  In year 2, Dr. Silver                         transects the California Current to learn whether the very                      large aggregates, which are hypothesized to be regeneration                     centers to Monterey Bay, occur in significant numbers further                   offshore.  These results will increase the understanding of the                 biology of midwater remineralization and the role that                          particles can play in the process.",
