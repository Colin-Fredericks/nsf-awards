 "awd_abstract_narration": "Idaho Teachers Excited About Cruisin' The Heavens (I TEACH)                     is a three year project which will prepare educators to                         develop and present an exciting hands-on astronomy unit.                        Six educators teams - consisting of three teachers and one                      administrator - will be selected from six regions throughout                    Idaho.  These teams will gather for a two-week summer                           institute in Boise at The Discovery Center of Idaho (DCI).                      The center's goal is to enrich and supplement formal                            education through an interactive approach to learning basic                     and applied science.  While at DCI, participants will learn                     to teach basic astronomy using hands-on activities, a                           portable planetarium and Native American, Greek, Roman, and                     Old European sky myths.                                                                                                                                         The teams will return to their home district with one-                          month's use of a portable planetarium and the requirement                       that they use it in their classrooms and give presentations                     for fellow teachers and community members.  During years one                    and two of the project, team members working with 7th - 9th                     graders will be targeted for selection.  I TEACH will be                        opened to participants working with 4th - 6th graders in                        year three.                                                                                                                                                     Beginning in year two, six regional facilitators will be                        selected from the previous year's I TEACH participants to                       assist teams with unit development during the two-week                          summer institute.  Regional facilitators will also provide                      technical support for I TEACH graduates as they team-teach a                    hands-on astronomy continuing education workshop in their                       home region.                                                                                                                                                    The Principal Investigator is Dr. Gilford.  Ms. Lorette                         Williams Executive Director of DCI is Co-PI serving as                          liaison with other institutions in Idaho.
