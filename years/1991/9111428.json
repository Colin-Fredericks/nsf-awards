 "awd_abstract_narration": "The successful functioning of market based economies depends in                 large measure on the existence of widespread public understanding               of the operation of market mechanisms and belief in the fairness,               efficiency and effectiveness of markets.  Given the existence of                centrally planned economies throughout Eastern Europe for most of               the post World War II era, there are real questions about the                   nature and extent of public understanding and appreciation of                   market mechanisms anywhere in Eastern Europe.  These questions                  raise serious concerns about the ability of the emerging                        democracies of Eastern Europe to make successful transitions from               centrally planned to market economies.                                                                                                                          This project undertakes exploratory research in Eastern Europe                  designed both to describe and explain existing economic attitudes               and beliefs of citizens in the centrally planned economies and to               provide baseline data that will permit more dynamic assessments of              the relationships between economic attitudes and beliefs and                    economic structures as Eastern European nations attempt the                     difficult transition from centrally planned to market economies.                                                                                                The significance of this research lies not only in what it will                 tell us about the prospects for developing market economies in the              several formerly communist nations of Eastern Europe but also in                what it will help us learn more broadly about the interplay of                  economic structures, their functions, and the nature of public                  economic thinking.",
