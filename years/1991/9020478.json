 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past three years of NSF support, progress was made in                understanding the regulation of shape and size in virus assembly                using bacteriophage T4.  Studies on head length regulation have                 shown that the DNA inside the virus is selected for packaging at                specific lengths that can be interpreted by reference to                        icosahedral surface lattice theory.  DNA packaging in T4 is                     therefore dependent on the design principles used by the capsid in              setting its length parameters.  Use of pulsed-field electrophoresis             of DNA has provided the highest resolution yet for the separation               of T4 DNA molecules.                                                                                                                                            The new work proposed here will focus on how the measuring system               that determines DNA packaging operates.  The head of phage T4 is                elongated, not icosahedral as for most viruses.  Mutations in the               internal protein core or scaffold proteins all cause the head to                revert to its icosahedral form.  All mutations that caused                      elongated heads (called giants) are located in the gene coding for              the virus coat protein (gp 23).  We will test the idea that gp 23               alone controls head elongation using cloned genes for both the                  scaffold and the coat protein in expression vectors, site-directed              deletions and mutagenesis, and molecular structure determination.               Purified gp23 will be subjected to crystallization conditions for               x-ray structure determination.  Of the four models for T4 head                  length determination that have been proposed, it is believed two                can be eliminated (the simple template and the kinetic models).                 This will now extend and confirm preliminary data that suggest that             length is controlled by a combination of a two-component protein                vernier mechanism and stabilization of accumulated strain at the                icosahedral vertices.  Together, the proposed experiments will help             substantially in understanding of the mechanisms of shape and size              control, and DNA packaging, at the subcellular level.",
