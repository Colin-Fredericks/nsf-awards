 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the best documented empirical regularities in criminology is              the positive association between past and future criminality.  One              interpretation of this association (termed state dependence) is                 that prior criminal involvement actually increases future criminal              propensity.  Another (termed population heterogeneity) is that the              association is not a reflection of a causal relationship but rather             is attributable to persistent differences across individuals in                 their propensity to engage in crime.  One or the other of these                 interpretations is suggested by many competing general theories of              crime.  Yet there has been little research attempting to                        distinguish these two fundamentally different explanations.                                                                                                     This project will statistically distinguish the relative importance             of the two explanations for the observed positive correlation                   between past and future criminality.  Two widely known panel data               sets will be used for the research--the National Youth Survey of                U.S. youths and the Farrington and West longitudinal survey of                  English males.  Not only will this research address the relative                contributions of state dependence and heterogeneity in explaining               the positive association of past to future delinquency/criminality,             but also it will illuminate the nature of the association of a                  variety of individual, familial, and behavioral factors to criminal             involvement.  Thus, the research will make important contributions              to extant general theories of crime.",
