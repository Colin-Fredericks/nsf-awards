 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for a study of how oviposition                         preference and specificity evolve in phytophagous insects during                shifts onto new hosts.  Current theory for host choice in                       insects holds that ovipositing females exhibit a preference                     hierarchy among potential host plants and according to the rank                 order in the hierarchy.  Host shifts then begin either as (a)                   genetic shifts in the preference hierarchy, (b) genetic changes                 that decrease the degree of specificity to highly ranked hosts                  and thereby broaden the range of hosts, or (c) colonization of                  plants lower on the preference hierarchy in the absence of more                 highly ranked plants with little or no genetic change in                        preference.  Recent work on two closely-related swallowtail                     butterfly species, Papilio zelicaon and P. oregonius, that feed                 on different plant families showed that these species exhibit                   quite different preference hierarchies.  Preliminary studies of                 other populations within this species complex, however, indicate                that some host shifts may not involve complete rearrangements in                preference hierarchy but instead reflect changes in degree of                   specificity or behavioral responses to available hosts.  This                   variation provides an opportunity to ask how much rearrangement                 of the preference hierarchy has occurred as populations in the P.               machaon species complex have diversified onto different host                    plants.                                                                                 Therefore, the proposed work will ask if the conclusions                on the evolution of oviposition preference drawn from                           interspecific differences between P. zelicaon and P. oregonius                  apply to population differentiation and speciation throughout the               P. machaon species complex in North America.  Objective 1 will                  ask how umbellifer-feeding species of the P. machaon complex                    differ in their preference hierarchy for plant species.  That is,               has colonization of new hosts always involved a reordering of                   the preference hierarchy and, if not, which hosts have required                 such a reordering?  Objective 2 will ask if populations of P.                   zelicaon differ in their preference hierarchy.  Papilio zelicaon                populations differ geographically in their host plants.                         Consequently, it is possible to compare the interspecific results               from objective 1 with intraspecific results in this section.                    Finally, Objective 3 will ask whether differences in preference                 hierarchy among populations of P. zelicaon are inherited as X-                  linked loci as are the interspecific difference between P.                      zelicaon and P. oregonius.  The recent finding that the major                   interspecific differences are primarily X-linked provides for the               first time the opportunity to compare the mode of inheritance of                intraspecific divergence in host preference with that observed                  for interspecific divergence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Thompson                                                                                                                                                             Together, the results for the three objectives will aid in                 the development of the theory of insect/plant interactions by                   addressing the fundamental problem of how oviposition preference                diverges as insect populations colonize new host plants.  Since                 much of insect diversity appears to arise from divergence onto                  different host species, the proposed work therefore also                        addresses the problem of the origins of insect diversity.",
