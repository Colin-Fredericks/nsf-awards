 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to research how a new educational              software tool, the Geometer's Sketchpad, based on state-of-the-                 art computer technology and advanced programming techniques, can                best be used by students and teachers in secondary schools.  This               research will lay the basis for the development and publication of              a set of teacher support materials including both teacher training              materials an student activity guides.  These can be used to better              enable teachers to effectively use the dynamic geometric                        constructions and script saving feature in The Geometer's                       Sketchpad.                                                                                                                                                      This project will include: analysis of educational research that                used existing geometric modeling software, observations and                     interviews with the initial group of students and teachers using                the The Geometer's Sketchpad, assessment of the attitudes and                   performance of these same students, identification of teacher in                effectively employing the software technology, creation and testing             of prototype teaching materials, and identification of needs for                teacher training.  Special attention will be given to identifying               how The Geometer's Sketchpad can be used successfully by the                    broadest spectrum of students, especially those underrepresented                in advanced mathematics classes-women, members of minorities, and               disabled.",
