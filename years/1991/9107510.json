 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior work has documented a change in host-plant preference                over the last ten years in a population of an herbivorous                       butterfly.  This population has incorporated a European weed into               its diet.  Comparing the preference of insects for plants                       maintained in laboratory culture for ten years will test whether                the change is due to adaptation by the insect or to a change in                 the plant that has increased its acceptability.  Similarly, the                 fact that different populations of this insect exhibit different                preferences could be due to genetic variation in the insect                     (already shown) or variation in the plants, or both.  The                       potential contribution of variation in plant acceptability to                   this geographic variation will be quantified.  The results of                   this research will show how the complexity of insect diet in time               and space arises from past and present insect-plant interactions.               The information has implications for biological pest control as                 a model for insect invasions of agricultural habitats.",
