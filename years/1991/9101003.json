 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Marine Studies of the University of Delaware                     will receive support for shipboard technician activities                        associated with the R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a 115-foot research                      vessel that is owned and operated by the University.  A                         significant portion of the ship's operating schedule during                     1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The                     Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea                      component and an ashore component.                                                                                                                              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                         personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;                             maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific                              instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck                            operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming                     and off-going scientific parties.  On shore activities                          include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared                      use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in                    preparing for field work on the vessel.  Shipboard                              technicians funded by this award have broad responsibilities                    for providing the coordination and assistance needed for the                    successful completion of research projects at sea.  The level                   of activity and amount of support are closely related to the                    size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                    and capability.",
