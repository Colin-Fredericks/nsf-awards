 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of cold acclimation is not well understood, but                     evidence is accruing for a genetic role in this process.  This                  project will focus on one aspect of gene regulation during cold                 acclimation, and the relationship of increased protein expression               in the adjustment of metabolism to low temperature in plants. A                 member of a class of proteins that becomes more abundant in                     plants and is therefore upregulated in during exposure to low                   temperature will be characterized in terms of structural                        organization of the protein(s) and gene(s), and regulation in                   response to low temperature and other related environmental                     stresses.  Previous work has demonstrated that the synthesis of                 these proteins in leaf tissue is closely associated with cold                   acclimation (cold acclimation protein CAP).  Using preparative                  electrophoresis techniques, sufficient amounts of one of these                  proteins have been obtained (CAP79) to determine amino acid                     sequences of CNBr fragments using a gas-phase sequenator to                     separate phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid derivatives.  The amino                 acid sequences, show that CAP79 is a 70kDa heat shock cognate.                  The sequence information was also used in the synthesis of                      oligonucleotides to probe a lambda Zap II cDNA library and to                   amplify specific genomic sequences by polymerase chain reaction                 (PCR).  Polyclonal antisera to this group of proteins have been                 modified.  Using these antibodies inframe cDNAs will be isolated                the identity of clones selected by oligos from the expression                   library will be confirmed.  The cDNAs will be characterized, and                used to isolate additional genomic sequences, with the intent to                characterize their structure and regulation by environmental                    factors that influence cold tolerance levels.  Isolation of all                 parts of these genes including the regulatory regions is the                    goal.  Cell fractionation and immunocytochemical staining studies               are planned to determine the cellular localization of this low                  temperature upregulated protein(s).  Experiments are described                  that may suggest associative interactions of CAP79 with other                   cellular components, and potential for repair of cryoinjury to                  cold sensitive proteins.//",
