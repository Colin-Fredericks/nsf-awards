 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most animals and plants get their genetic material DNA from                two immediate parents, and proceeding to more distant ancestors,                from a very large number of contributors.  How long a stretch of                DNA typically survives this recombination process without itself                being broken up, over a given time?  Bacteria, too owe their                    genetic material to many sources, although the exchange of DNA                  fragments begins with small pieces (as opposed to the crossing                  over known in higher organisms) and takes place less frequently.                In any event, the same question arises.  A model has been                       developed to serve as a framework for the analysis of the                       transmission over many generation of pieces of DNA in both                      bacteria and higher organisms.  The model has worked well so far                in the analysis of genetic variation in bacteria using both                     direct and indirect assessment of nucleotide sequences.  It will,               hopefully, lead to clearer insight in to the dynamics of                        evolution in bacteria.  This has practical applications for the                 release of genetically engineered microorganisms:  how likely is                a form, designed to work within safe bounds, to pick up genes                   that permit it to \"escape\" and become virulent?  It should, in                  addition help solve ancient questions as to whether certain                     organisms persist without genetic recombination indefinitely.  It               should also help us interpret and make long-term predictions                    about the likely associations of alleles at two or more nearby                  loci in humans.  The present project is designed to get values                  for the following variables in the well known bacterium E. coli:                the initial size of DNA replacements, the frequency of                          replacements in relation to the frequency of individual time, and               the rate of selection of new favorable mutations that can cause a               strain of bacteria to spread all over the world.",
