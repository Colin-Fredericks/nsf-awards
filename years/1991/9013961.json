 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pressures of international economic competition and the                     changes in eastern Europe increase the importance of planning for               conversion of our defense economy to civilian work.  Engineers                  are among those who are most likely to be involved in conversion                issues and to affect the conversion process in a number of                      industries, such as electronics, aerospace, transportation                      equipment, and instruments.  This workshop project will address                 the range of issues -- ethical, social, economic, and technical -               - which engineers confront as they consider roles in the economic               conversion process.  A research team will guide this project.                   The approach is to examine these issues through discussion of                   prepared presentations by academic researchers and practicing                   engineers from the defense industry in a workshop which includes                representatives from a range of engineering societies.  The                     findings will be synthesized by means of discussion in the                      workshop and by the work of the research team immediately                       following the conference.  The research team plans four products                for dissemination: a synthesis of papers in the proceedings and                 three monographs, one on research needs, one on policy                          implications, and one on implications for engineering education.                Members of American Engineers for Social Responsibility and                     representatives of five other engineering professional societies                will play a leading role in disseminating these products to                     appropriate members of congressional committees and federal                     agencies, as well as to their members.                                                                                                                          This proposal is a reasonable request for support to enable                     leading scholars and practitioners to begin to address ethical                  issues as well as practical problems for engineers in the                       conversion process.  The principal investigator and research team               are well qualified; institutional support is very good; the                     workshop plans are careful and appropriately meshed with related                activities; dissemination is likely to be broad and to reach a                  variety of audiences.  Support is highly recommended.",
