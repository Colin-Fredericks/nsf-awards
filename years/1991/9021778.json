 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to West                Virginia University for the renovation and repair of the West                   Virginia University Geo-data Processing Laboratory which is a part              of the Department of Geology and Geography.  The West Virginia                  University Geo-data Processing Laboratory focuses on the                        integrated storage, processing, and analysis of spatial and                     geophysical data, and it supports research and research training                in the fields of geographic information systems (GIS), remote                   sensing, digital mapping, spatial statistics, and geophysics.                   The building which houses the Geo-data Processing Laboratory was                constructed in 1942 and last renovated in 1981.  The ARFMP grant                of $180,000 and $212,752 provided by the grantee as cost sharing                will be used to modernize these research and research training                  facilities.  This project will address significant deficiencies of              the current research infrastructure by providing (a) electrical                 circuitry sufficient to support all the equipment, (b) temperature              control and ventilation adequate to prevent computer shutdown, (c)              suitable lighting, (d) necessary conduit and computer cabling to                enable the full potential of the computer system to be used, and                (e) a reconfiguration of the individual laboratories into more                  suitable sizes.  Benefits accruing from this renovation will be the             improvement and expansion of system use.                                                                                                                        This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of undergraduate and graduate students.  Students              trained in these laboratories will have command of a technology                 which has great potential to facilitate advances in many fields of              science.",
