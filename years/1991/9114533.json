 "awd_abstract_narration": "An experimental/numeric study will be carried out for acquiring the             understanding of the basic mechanics of the generation and                      propagation of thermoelastically generated Lamb waves that is                   needed to exploit these waves for nondestructive evaluation of                  wafers, plates and panels.  Since Lamb waves propagate in the plane             of a plate and affect the whole thickness, they are excellent for               determining the extent and severity of defects such as surface                  cracks, delaminations and local changes in material properties.                 Broadband transient Lamb waves will be generated by irradiating a               small area on the surface of a plate with a short duration fiber                guided laser pulse.  The resultant thermal shock generates a wave               which is then sensed by a fiber-optic interferometer.  Data                     analysis will be in the frequency domain where the imprints that                defects leave on the wave are most clearly evident.  The numeric                and experimental methods will be combined to study the basic                    parameters involved in the generation and propagation of these                  waves and in the ways in which they are influenced by defects.  The             resultant knowledge will be used to design efficient means for                  generating waves with desirable characteristics and to optimize the             overall system for identifying and characterizing defects both for              quality control and safety assurance.",
