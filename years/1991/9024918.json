 "awd_abstract_narration": "After mating, female salamanders of many species can store                      spermatozoa for long periods of time before fertilizing their eggs.             The spermatozoa are stored in glands in the cloaca called                       spermathecae.  Little is known about the cytology of the processes              by which spermatozoa remain viable at ambient temperatures in these             glands.  In this research, the PI proposes to use transmission                  electron microscopy to study sperm storage in three species of                  salamanders.  Students from Saint Mary's College, an undergraduate              women's college, will be research assistants.  Female Ambystoma                 tigrinum fertilize eggs soon after mating, so sperm storage is                  brief.  Female Eurycea cirrigera may store sperm for 6 months, but              not between breeding seasons.  Female Notophthalmus viridescens may             store sperm from one breeding season to the next (10 months).                   Topics to be addressed include:  whether the spemathecae secrete                a substance during mating that attracts sperm to the glands; how                the sperms are nourished during storage in the spermathecae;                    whether the spermathecae secrete a substance that activates                     spermatozoa prior to fertilization; and the fate of spermatozoa                 left in the spermathecae after fertilization of an egg clutch.                  Knowledge of sperm storage mechanisms in salamanders may be useful              in studies of fertility in other vertebrates, including man.",
