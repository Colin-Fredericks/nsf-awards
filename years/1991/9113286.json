 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Waymouth                    will investigate the mechanism and stereochemistry of                           stereospecific catalysis and cyclopolymerization with Group IV                  metallocenes. Specific aims are as follows: (i) to develop                      detailed understanding of the mechanism and stereochemistry of                  cyclopolymerization with homogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts,                   (ii) to exploit the cyclopolymerization methodology to                          synthesize a variety of main-chain chiral polymers, and (iii)                   to apply mechanistic principles for the design of second                        generation metallocene catalysts for olefin hydrogenation,                      polymerization, and diolefin cyclization reactions.                             %%%                                                                             Although Ziegler and Natta announced their discovery of                         heterogeneous catalysis nearly 40 years ago, surprisingly                       little is known about the mechanism of these reactions. Dr.                     Waymouth has developed a new class of soluble catalysts that                    offer the potential for gaining new mechanistic insight into                    polymerization reactions. It is likely that an increased level                  of understanding of polymerization mechanisms will result from                  Dr. Waymouth's investigations. This, in turn, is expected to                    lead to the development of valuable new synthetic polymers.",
