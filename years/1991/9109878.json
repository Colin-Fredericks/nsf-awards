 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research describes the various Gif-type systems which                      oxidize selectively saturated hydrocarbons to ketones by                        non-radical mechanisms.  Modifications will enable the                          selective synthesis of secondary phenylthio-, phenylseleno-,                    chloro- and bromo-derivatives of saturated hydrocarbons and of                  secondary polysulfides.  In a variation of the GoAggII system                   (pyridine - acetic acid - ferric chloride + hydrogen peroxide),                 a system (GoAggIII) has been developed that oxidizes (30%                       conversion) saturated hydrocarbons to ketones nearly                            quantitatively.  Two intermediates in this system have been                     characterised which will be studied by physical techniques and                  by selective trapping. The former are dynamic C-13 NMR, 0-17                    NMR, ESCA spectroscopy, Mossbauer spectroscopy and resonance                    Raman spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                             The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting a continuation of                   the studies of the complex oxidation system developed by Dr.                    Barton to selectively functionalize saturated hydrocarbons.                     The chemistry has parallels in the reactions that are catalyzed                 by the enzyme methane monooxygenase.  This work should lead to                  a system that can perform this important reaction in a                          synthetically useful manner.",
