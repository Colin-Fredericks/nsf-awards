 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to increase access to science                 careers for student with disabilities.  The project staff is                    disseminating information in the Eastern North Carolina region                  to science teachers on the teaching of students with                            disabilities and about the career opportunities in science and                  technology for students with disabilities.  They are actively                   recruiting students in the area for careers in science and                      technology, and are providing science teachers in the region                    consultation on problems encountered by students with                           disabilities in science courses and laboratories.  A lending                    library of adaptive technologies is being established and will                  serve the region's junior and senior high schools as well                       Eastern North Carolina's community colleges.  The institution's                 track record speaks well for the success of this current                        project.  In the Fall of 1986, East Carolina University                         established the Science Institute for the Disabled, and has                     made extraordinary efforts to provide higher education for                      students with disabilities.",
