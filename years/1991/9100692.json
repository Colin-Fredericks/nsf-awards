 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal grant is in support of research in computational                   statistical mechanics.  A variety of projects will be studied which             are amenable to solution using advanced computational techniques.               Techniques will be developed and refined for the large scale                    simulation of phase transitions in systems with competing                       interactions.  Dynamical critical phenomena will be studied.  Other             research topics wil include capillary condensation, high resolution             Ising model simulations, finite size effects in the classical                   Heisenberg model, random systems, magnetic superlattices and                    surface phase transitions.  Various techniques will be used to                  implement these simulations including Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo                  renormalization group, molecular dynamics and spin dynamics.                    Computational simulations of systems composed of many particle                  represent an alternative to the usual theoretical calculations and              experimental investigation.  The principal investigator on this                 grant is an accomplished expert on simulations of physical                      phenomena.  The principal investigator will study a variety of                  current problems in statistical mechanics which are amenable to                 solution using computational simulation and will also develop                   associated algorithms to facilitate these simulations.  The                     research topics are of intrinsic interest in condensed matter                   physics in addition to having possible application to magnetic                  materials, surface behavior of materials and algorithm development.",
