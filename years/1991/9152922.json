 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to initiate teaching of nerve,                      muscle and cardiac physiology in animal physiology and                          introductory biology laboratories.  Computers are used with                     modern physiological instrumentation to acquire and analyze                     data from physiological events in nerves and muscle.  Computer                  simulations will reinforce principles of nerve and muscle                       function.  Students in Biology of Organisms are introduced to                   data acquisition systems to teach them principles of muscle                     physiology in a hands-on setting.  Force transducers and                        amplifiers are interfaced with computers equipped with data                     acquisition software to record and store data from contraction                  of frog muscle.  The oscilloscope of the new software will                      permit analysis of nerve action potentials.  Students will use                  these physiological work stations extensively when conducting                   experiments in nerve, muscle and cardiac function during the                    research-projects portion of Animal Physiology.  This project                   will significantly extend the instructional capability of our                   department into areas of physiology that currently cannot be                    taught because of a lack of modern instrumentation.                             Computerized data acquisition is the most cost-effective means                  of initiating these kinds of laboratory experiences.",
