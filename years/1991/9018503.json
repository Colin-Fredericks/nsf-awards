 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individual Antennapedia and Bithorax complex homeobox genes in                  Drosophila have the remarkable property  of speciying the                       identity of entire segments of the larva during development.                    Current evidence indicates that these genes encode transcription                factors.  Although a great deal is known about the structure and                regulation of the two homeobox genes complexes, the next tier of                genes, \"downstream\" genes, regulated by the homeotics have not                  been identified.                                                                     The PI's laboratory has characterized \"enhancer trap\"                      transposon insertions in Drosophila whose expression of LacZ is                 now regulated by the homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) in                       imaginal discs.  These newly acquired instances of regulation by                Antp are presumably due to adjacent enhancer sequences.  The                    isolation and characterization of these sequences which are                     normally regulated by Antp will allow for the generation of                     detailed patterns of expression of genes normally expressed later               in the developemnt of the imaginal discs and which are under the                control of Antp.  These studies should aid in understanding how                 the regulatory mechaninms for establishing patterns are connected               to cell differentiation as it occurs during morphogenesis.",
