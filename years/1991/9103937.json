 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on problems of multiple instance combinatorial          optimization, particularly two types of multiple instance network flow          and cut problems, and combinatorial problems that are solved by such            multiple instance computations.  Many non-trivial combinatorial                 problems are solved by solving a sequence of network flow or minimum            cut problems, where each successive problem instance differs from its           predecessor in a highly structured way.  The similarity of the problem          instances allows the sequence to be solved much more efficiently than           by solving each instance independently.  This project will                      concentrate on multiple instance network flow and minimum cut                   problems that are generated either by changing the choice of source             and sink nodes, or by systematically changing edge capacities.  An              important approach to these problems is to understand the structure of          the set of solutions to the space of all problem instances that might           be encountered in the sequence, and to use this structural                      understanding to efficiently represent, in some compact implicit form,          the set of solutions to all potential instances.  Then once a                   particular instance is specified, it can be expanded and retrieved              from the representation faster than by solving the instance from                scratch.  Hence a large part of the project is directed towards                 developing such structural understanding and compact representations.",
