 "awd_abstract_narration": "This laboratory has identified a gene that appears to encode a                  novel class of receptors in plants.  The molecular architecture of              this putative plant cell receptor is reminiscent of the receptor                tyrosine kinases (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin                and insulin-like receptors, and platelet-derived growth factor                  receptor) known in animals.  It consists of a cytoplasmic domain                that is homologous to the serine/threonine-specific protein                     kinases.  This kinase domain is linked, via a membrane-spanning                 stretch of amino acids, to an extracellular domain.  This                       extracellular domain is related to S-locus (self-incompatibility)               glycoproteins of Brassica, which are involved in pollen                         recognition.  The newly isolated gene may represent a prototype of              an entire class of plant cell receptors with protein kinase                     activity.  The proposed research will establish the biochemical                 properties of the maize putative protein kinase and obtain a clear              understanding of its tissue, cellular, and subcellular                          distribution.                                                                                                                                                   All cells bear on their surfaces molecular receptors that sense                 external information and relay this information into the cell.  The             subject of the proposed research is a newly identified receptor-                like molecule in plants.  The structure of this molecule resembles              that of some important growth factor receptors of animal cells.                 The goal of this project is to study the biochemistry and                       distribution of this molecule in plants.  Molecules of this type                could be of profound importance in developmental and environmental              responses and cell to cell signaling in higher plants.",
