 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the dramatic political, social and economic changes               currently underway in the Soviet Union and through out Eastern                  Europe is one of the most important challenges facing the social                sciences.  This award renews support for research designed to                   monitor public opinion in the Soviet Union and to study relations               between public opinion and political leaders as the Soviet Union                struggles with the process of democratization.                                                                                                                  Specifically this project builds on an 1990 survey of Soviet                    citizens by conducting a second set of interviews with Soviet                   citizens in three republics: the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and               Lithuania.  The interviews will measure the extent of public                    support or opposition to the institutional changes.  They also will             permit assessments of the nature and extent of ethnic and regional              divisions and other potential stumbling blocks to the establishment             of democratic processes.  In addition, interviews with members of               the Supreme Soviet in each of the three Republics and the elected               representatives to the USSR Congress of People's Deputies will                  provide the first systematic evidence of the leadership's personal              preferences and their perceptions of citizen needs and demands.                                                                                                 When completed this project will provide systematic evidence of the             relations developing between Soviet citizens and their                          representatives.  This evidence will be invaluable in understanding             the global processes by which centralized, authoritarian states                 evolve toward more decentralized, open, and democratic governments.",
