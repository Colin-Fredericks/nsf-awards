 "awd_abstract_narration": "An innovative science course for non-science majors will be                     developed in a collaborative effort involving Columbia College,                 Indiana University and Princeton University.  The course will                   use topics in environmental science to communicate basic                        scientific concepts in a relevant and meaningful way.  For                      example, the topic of nuclear power will provide a vehicle for                  teaching atomic structure, chemical bonds, radioactivity,                       fission and fusion. Environmental issues offer an excellent way                 to introduce the major scientific disciplines because so many                   of them have important physical, geological, chemical and                       biological dimensions as well as others involving engineering,                  economics, political science and psychology.  The course will                   have an interdisciplinary approach; learning will be                            facilitated by having the students incorporate the skills of                    their major field of study in course projects, such as video                    tapes, magazine articles, theater scripts, paintings, posters                   and sculptures.  Dissemination will be accomplished with                        workshops and video tapes as well as printed material and                       meeting presentations.  There is significant institutional                      support for this project.",
