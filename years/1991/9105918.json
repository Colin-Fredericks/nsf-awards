 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Weinberg is studying the transcriptional regulation of two                  histone H4 genes which are expressed with different temporal                    programs in the sea urchin embryo. The early H4 gene is                         transcribed in the cleavage and early blastula stages and is not                expressed at gastrula. The particular late H4 gene he is studying               is expressed at a low level until mid-blastula when transcription               markedly increases. The major goal is to understand the control                 network involved in the differential regulation of these two                    genes. These studies should provide a model for gene regulation                 at a very early embryonic stage. The sea urchin H4 histone genes                have a number of features similar to vertebrate H4 genes and                    information gained from the research proposed here should be                    relevant to H4 gene regulation in other organisms. Moveover,                    there are two aspects of sea urchin EH4 gene expression which are               particularly exciting. The first is that a major part of the                    developmental control of the gene is negative. Deletions which                  include a 10 bp sequence between -150 and -140 result in a                      failure to repress transcription at post-blastula stages. One of                the goals of the proposal is to understand this mode of EH4 gene                control. A second feature which is of special interest is that                  the TATA box is required for transcription only if the binding                  site for the positive acting factor UHF-1 is deleted. Moreover,                 in an in vivo expression assay, the LH4 TATA box cannot                         substitute for the early TATA sequence in a gene lacking the UHF-               1 site. One of the goals is to investigate how UHF-1, TFIID, and                an initiator element are involved in the initiation of                          transcription. The general strategy of these experiments is to                  identify sequence elements and test arrangements of the elements                by transcription in nuclear extracts or by using an in vivo                     expression assay in which genes are injected into fertilized eggs               of another sea urchin species.",
