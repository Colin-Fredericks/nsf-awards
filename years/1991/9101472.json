 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigators will analyze                   four problems involving nonlinear differential and integral                     equations.  The first problem is an integro-differential equation               that describes the entry of a wedge into a bath of water.  The                  second problem involves the use of homotopy methods to study the                existence of travelling wave solutions of integral and                          differential equations that arise in applications.  The third                   problem involves the use of shooting methods to study the                       behavior of chaotic orbits.  And finally the fourth problem                     concerns finding similarity solutions of some two-dimensional                   versions of the Navier-Stokes equations.                                             Many of the mathematical models that describe the behavior                 of everyday phenomena involve integral equations or differential                equations or combinations of these two types of equations.  Very                often it is easiest to study the solutions of such equations                    qualitatively, that is, instead of looking for exact analytical                 or numerical solutions that can be quite complicated, one looks                 for approximate representations of the solutions that contain,                  more or less, the essence of the exact solution.  In this project               the principal investigators will use qualitative methods to study               the solutions of integral and differential equations that arise                 in fluid dynamics, biology and mechanics.",
