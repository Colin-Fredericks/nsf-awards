 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low-intensity elective logging of tropical forests is a                    promising means of according tropical forests economic value,                   thus providing a financial incentive for their retention.                       Currently lacking, but vital, are good data on the demography of                timber species in order to make selective harvesting of tropical                timber species sustainable.                                                          This study will examine in detail the ecology and demography               of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), a valuable hardwood species                in the Neotropics.  Dr. Hubbell will study the demography of                    mahogany in (1) pristine forest, (ii) in recently logges forests,               and (iii) forest logged 20 years ago.  Demographic data from                    pristine forest will identify the factors responsible for                       controlling the abundance of mahogany in natural populations.                   Demographic data from the recently logged forest will provide                   data on immediate mortality of individuals during logging, and                  estimates of residual stocking after logging.  The demography of                mahogany in forest logging twenty year ago will provide data on                 the long-term response of natural populations to selective                      logging.  Information from this study will aid in assessing the                 sustainability of current logging operations, and through                       simulation models, developing better forest management practises.                    Dr. Hubbell will also assist in forming a long-term research               program by (i) training Bolivian nationals in data collection and               analysis techniques, and (ii) establishing permanent forest                     inventory plots, which will provide the basis for future research               on other potentially commercial species.",
