 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes the Philadelphia Elementary Science                     Teacher Leader Program which will establish 28 teacher-                         principal teams of 84 public and parochial educators in grades                  1-3 as leaders in the citywide implementation of a new                          activity-based program for elementary science study.  Two                       teachers and a principal will be selected as a team from each                   of twenty-eight schools. The three year project will increase                   the teachers' knowledge of elementary science content, promote                  peer leadership and support, and establish the teachers as                      experienced curriculum writers through a three-year agenda of                   Summer Science Institutes and six annual professional                           development colloquia. These teachers and principals will                       develop permanent roles as leaders of required in-service                       workshops on the effective use of elementary science kits for                   the city's public and parochial school teachers.                                                                                                                The three-week summer workshops will cover the content areas                    of physical, earth and life sciences.  The teachers will be                     provided with practical experiences in running in-service                       workshops for their peers. The workshops will also provide a                    framework for collegial evaluation in the development of                        interdisciplinary activities based on hands-on science                          lessons.  In addition, all participants will attend a one-                      week Institute during July of 1993 to further evaluate the                      impact of the Elementary Science Teacher Leader project and                     plan for the permanence and expansion of the Teacher                            Leadership roles.                                                                                                                                               The School Department of Philadelphia and the Office of                         Catholic Education are supporting the released time, the                        purchase of the elementary science kits in sufficient number                    to implement the program in all their elementary schools, the                   salaries of school district liaisons, school-based follow-up                    workshops and other materials necessary for the project.  The                   actual dollar cost-share from the schools and the Franklin                      Institute to implement this science kit, activity-based,                        leader teacher/principal approach to improve elementary                         science education is equivalent to 170% of the NSF request.",
