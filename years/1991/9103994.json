 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David VanVranken has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. VanVranken's doctoral degree was                  from Stanford University under the supervision of Professor                     Barry Trost. Dr. VanVranken intends to continue his research at                 the University of California at Berkeley under the sponsorship                  of Professor Peter Schultz. The postdoctoral experience will                    train him in antibody catalysis, protein modification via                       site-directed mutagenesis, and protein and antibody structure                   and modification. Longer term, he plans to develop antibody                     catalysts for the cleavage and transfer of phosphate esters.                    %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new PH.D.s and attract them into                    meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
