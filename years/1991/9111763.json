 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the 1980s, the majority of sub-Saharan African nations              were engulfed in an economic crisis.  Growth in poverty and                     unemployment escalated with the greatest increases occurring among              women heading households.  A small, strong informal sector might                assist in alleviating these problems.  This Minority Research                   Initiation Planning Grant examines entrepreneurship in small and                informal sector firms in two cities in Zimbabwe seeking to identify             the personal attributes of those who begin such firms, their                    educational and employment histories, the successes and problems                they have encountered in operating their businesses, and the                    existence of governmental or nongovernmental agencies to support                their endeavors to enhance our understanding of the composition,                contributions and articulation of the informal sector to formal                 activities and to the larger national and global economies.  In-                depth interviews with entrepreneurs who began small and informal                businesses in these cities and with civil serves and others                     involved in governmental and nongovernmental agencies providing                 support for these firms will be conducted and analyzed.                                                                                                              This preliminary research will provide valuable information                about the role the informal sector might play in generating                     employment, particularly for women, in Sub-Saharan Africa.  This                project also provides an excellent opportunity for a promising                  young scholar to lay the foundation for more extensive research on              gender and entrepreneurship.",
