 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to encourage more outstanding undergraduates        to pursue research careers.  Considerable experience has been gained in         the last four years with successful REU sites.  This year the program           is continued with the key aspects of the previous years including:  (1)         a successful recruitment program; (2) careful matching of student               interests with available research projects; (3) an effective management         structure; (4) research assignments the students can quickly grasp and          complete in the proposed time frame; and (5) follow-up procedures               designed to maintain student interest in research.  The four research           projects involve probabilistic methods, state-of-the-art soils testing,         scale modeling, structural testing, and soil-structure interaction.  Two        students are involved in each project to allow for student interaction.         Interaction is also fostered by group seminars and meetings.  Follow-           through strategies include a newsletter mailed after the REU student            leaves the University of Maine.  The students have full use of advanced         laboratories and computational facilities.",
