 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rise of modern science, especially modern biological science,               has been tied to a close observation of nature.  This is most                   closely associated with the brilliant observations of Andreas                   Vesalius whose anatomical drawings are as much works of art as they             are careful delineations of the human form.  Yet, if we have                    learned anything from the revolution in history and philosophy of               science of the 1960's and 70's, we have learned that \"observation\"              is \"theory-laden.\"  To a very large extent, what we see is                      predetermined by the theory to which we ascribe.  In anatomy and                physiology, this \"fact\" can be seen in the observations of the                  human body.  For centuries, for example, writers on anatomy and                 physiology wrote of the \"horns\" of the uterus and a five-lobbed                 liver; but it is \"apparent\" to us that the human uterus has no                  \"horns\" while the liver has only two lobes, not five.  Similar                  observational \"errors\" can be found in dealing with the heart--we               now believe that the blood \"circulates\" but for millennia, the                  arterial and venal systems were considered to be separate.                                                                                                      Because the relationship of theory with observation is central to               contemporary philosophy of science, it is important to understand               their relationship in this first great modern observer of the human             anatomy.  Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica, first                  published in 1543, is generally acknowledged to be one of the most              important books of the Renaissance.  Yet Vesalian scholarship has               mostly been concentrated on the illustrations, his minor works, and             his biography.  The lengthy text of the Fabrica--that is, the part              of the work that presents the theory which controlled in some sense             what he observed--has been much less studied.  With this grant,                 Professor Siraisi aims to elucidate Vesalius's understanding and                presentation of anatomy and physiology in his principal work in the             context of the scientific culture of the age.  Her objective is to              investigate the Fabrica as an example of Renaissance scientific                 writing, considering text and illustrations together as Vesalius                intended his readers to do.  The result will be a close reading of              the scientific and scholarly activities involved in Renaissance                 anatomy and their relationship to humanistic medical culture, as                well as a fuller picture of the scientific and cultural assumptions             of a leading figure in Renaissance science.  The study will address             several broad historical themes of current interest:  the role of               the life sciences in scientific developments of the 16th and 17th               centuries; 16th century humanistic medical learning and the culture             of the medical community; the development of early modern                       scientific methodology and values, including the role of physical               demonstration and methods of persuasion and proof.  Her results                 will be of interest to philosophers of science, especially of                   biology, of historians of science and medicine, and Renaissance                 cultural and intellectual historians.",
