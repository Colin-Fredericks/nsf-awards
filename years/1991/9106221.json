 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Deltocephalus-like genera of leafhoppers have posed a                  difficult problem for workers because of an absence of phylogenetic             information and definitive characters necessary for generic                     separation.  Towards obtaining a clearer picture of phylogenies in              this group, the investigators hope to perform cladistic and                     molecular analyses of a subset of 24 nearctic genera in which                   fusion of the connective and aedeagus appears to represent a                    synapomorphic character of the subset.  A current problem in the                field of molecular systematics is that there is no agreement as to              which DNA sequences can be used in insect taxonomic studies at the              generic level.  Almost all molecular systematic studies to date                 have compared species at higher taxonomic levels.  Most of the                  sequences which have been examined at these levels are monomorphic              at lower taxonomic levels.  At the other extreme there are                      sequences which demonstrate extensive intraspecific variation but               which may present no recognizable homology at higher taxonomic                  levels.                                                                              Funding is requested for one year to examine eight different               DNA sequences in leafhoppers selected at four taxonomic levels.                 Five candidate nuclear regions and three mtDNA regions have been                identified.  The nuclear DNA regions include: 1,2) two internal                 spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) in the rDNA cistron, 3) a hypervariable                 region of the 28s from the rDNA cistron, 4) an intron in the                    invariant histone H2A gene and 5) the ribosomal S14 protein gene                and its intron.  The mitochondrial genes are: 1) a region of the                12s rDNA 2) the 16s rDNA and 3) a region of the cytochrome oxidase              III gene.  All regions will be amplified with PCR and sequenced.                These regions will be initially compared among three species in                 three tribes in the leafhopper subfamily Deltocephalinae, if the                sequences show variation at this level, two additional species will             be compared within two of the three tribes.  If intergeneric                    variation is detected within tribes then two species within one                 genus will be examined.  If variation is detected at this level                 then an examination of intraspecific variation will take collection             from different geographic populations of one species.  With this                protocol the taxonomic level at which each of these sequences can               be used can be determined.  The goal is to identify 2-3 DNA                     sequences which can be used in an intensive survey of 24 genera of              the Deltocephalus-like genera of leafhoppers.",
