 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of design methodologies have generally been                associated with specific aspects of engineering design -- also                  known as DF (X) methodologies -- where DF (X) represents Design For             (x) and the X represents functions such as assembly, manufacturing,             quality, and even disassembly.  This project is directed at the                 development of a generalized definition of DF (X) principles and                methodologies.  It will also be an investigation of the relational              mapping of generalized principles and methodologies to problem                  specific principles and methodologies.                                               The operational tool is a relational data base linking DF (X)              applications and a general definition of this concept.  This effort             will assist in assessing if an effective translation exists between             abstract concepts of design and the application of design                       methodologies.",
