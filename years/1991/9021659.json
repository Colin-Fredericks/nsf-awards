 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work involves investigation of the social behavior of                 the acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus), a cooperatively                 breeding species, using a completely color-banded population                    intensively monitored since 1971. Based on behavioral                           observations, groups of this species appear to consist of                       multiple reproductive males and females along with apparently                   nonbreeding offspring from prior years. However, complete                       understanding of the behavior of this species has been                          compromised by previous inability to precisely determine                        parentage within groups. This study will initiate efforts to                    address this problem using new molecular techniques that are able               to resolve uncertainties of parentage.                                               Determination of parentage will contribute substantially to                the understanding of social behavior by clarifying the                          conflicting roles of competition and cooperation within the                     highly complex acorn woodpecker society. Such knowledge has                     potential applications to all fields involving the study of                     sociality including anthropology, sociology, and behavioral                     ecology.",
