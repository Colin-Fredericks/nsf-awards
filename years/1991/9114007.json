 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is intended to provide early research                    experience and other university associations to academically                    qualified African American, Hispanic, and Native American                       students to encourage their participation in professional                       careers in the physical and mathematical sciences, especially                   through attainment of advanced degrees.  The research                           experience will be provided in faculty laboratories where                       research in areas of astronomy, chemistry, geology,                             mathematics (including computer science), and physics is                        being performed.                                                                  The program is designed to provide continuous (academic                       year, ten hours per week; summer, 40 hours per week for eight                   weeks) research and faculty mentor exposure through the                         students' junior and senior year and possibly the first year                    of a graduate program.  This project design permits continued                   contact and reinforcement of degree and career objectives for                   the student.  Both summer and academic year (AY) activities                     will include weekly (summer) and biweekly (AY) interactive                      colloquia that will include student reports of their research                   activities to the group and discussions of topics of broad                      application, such as career objectives, ethics in science, and                  computer applications to science problem solving.  Career                       perspectives and student social interactions will be enhanced                   by including (AY colloquia) students of the \"Minority Access                    to Energy-Related Careers\" program, in which student summer                     research is conducted in DOE laboratories in the western                        states.",
