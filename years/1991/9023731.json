 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Graduate School of Oceanography at the University of                        Rhode Island will acquire several items of oceanographic                        instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use                            equipment.  This equipment is maintained for use on or in                       association with the R/V ENDEAVOR, a research vessel owned by                   the NSF and operated by the university.  A substantial part                     of the ship's operating schedule during 1991 is in support of                   NSF-sponsored research projects.  The instrumentation will                      also increase the capabilities of the ship and of the                           University to support research and engineering activities.                      The instrumentation includes:                                                   -Gyro repeater to display ship's heading in the main                             scientific laboratory,                                                         -High density computer tape drive for increasing shared-use,                     sea-going computing capabilities,                                              -Rosette sampler adapter plates to improve the existing                          system's ability for collecting discrete seawater samples at                    specific water depths,                                                         -Niskin bottles for collecting discrete seawater samples at                      various depths in the water column,                                            -Precision acoustic pingers for determining position of an                       instrument package relative to the surface or seafloor,                        -Upgrade for a precision salinometer used for the precision                      determination of seawater salinity, and                                        -Temperature, conductivity, and wind sensors to augment                          routine data collection capabilities, and                                      -Box Corer upgrade to allow collection of sediment and soil                      samples from the sea floor.                                                                                                                                    The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored                           research and engineering projects.",
