 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Patricia McAnany                  will conduct one season of fieldwork at the archaeological site                 of K'axob and analyze the materials collected.  The site, located               on a low rise in the lowland swamp and riverine country of                      northern Belize, covers about 84 hectares and includes                          approximately 90 structures with detectable surface elevation.                  The majority of these are low platforms.  Prior excavation has                  indicated that this Mayan site includes stratified Formative                    Period strata and therefore it documents the early phase of the                 rise of Mayan civilization.  In 1990, Dr. McAnany conducted test                excavations at a large mound - Structure 18 - and recovered a                   sequence of human burials which cover most of the Formative and                 succeeding Classic periods.  She will continue this work and                    expose a large horizontal area in this portion of the site.                     Excavation will also be conducted at other structures within this               complex as well as at other plaza groups.  While all classes of                 recovered remains will be studied, analysis will focus in three                 specific areas: 1. Domestic architecture will be analyzed to                    document chronological changes in the use of space within one                   location and to investigate differences in architectural                        elaboration among locations. 2. Burial practices.  Since the way                individuals are interred can yield information on social                        organization, and how this changes over time attention will be                  focussed on the predicted 170+ remains.  3. Flora and molluscs.                 These materials provide a basis for environmental reconstruction                and through their analysis it should be possible to trace                       changing land use and agricultural practices.                                                                                                                   Prior to European arrival, the Maya peoples built a civilization                in the inhospitable lowland jungles of Middle America.  During                  its height in the Classic Period, cities centered around large                  temples and a priestly elite, were established and considerable                 archaeological research has provided a good picture of this                     interval.  However, much less is known about the preceeding                     periods which set the groundwork for this achievement and Dr.                   McAnany's research should help to remedy this situation.  It                    focusses on the development of the social inequality which is                   manifest during the Classic Period and which, Dr. McAnany                       believes  provided a driving force for change.  By studying                     variation in architecture, land use and burial practices she                    hopes to study this process in detail.                                                                                                                          This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to many archaeologists.  It will increase our                  understanding of the emergence of Mayan civilization and provide                insight into how complex societies arise.",
