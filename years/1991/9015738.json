 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several technologies are in use for the safe treatment of                       hazardous wastes.  Some of these include adsorption,                            incineration, and biodegradation.  Aqueous waste streams with                   moderate organic concentrations (1-30%)  may be too dilute for                                                                                                  economical incineration and too concentrated for treatment by                   adsorption or biodegradation.  For such streams oxidation in                    supercritical water (SCW) is a potential alternative                            technology.  Hazardous organic chemicals present in aqueous                     waste streams can thus be converted to carbon dioxide and                       water.  This work is aimed at understanding the kinetics of                     the oxidation of hazardous organic wastes in SCW to be used in                                                                                                  the design and development of such processes.                                                                                                                   Phenol, naphthalene, chlorobenzene and acetic acid will be                      oxidized in SCW.  The oxidation reactions will be conducted in                                                                                                  a flow reactor and the products will be analyzed by high                        performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and gas                                                                                                  chromatography mass spectrometry.  Examining the variation of                   the products' yields and the reactant conversion with the                       reactor residence time will facilitate resolution of the                        reaction pathways and determination of the reaction kinetics.                                                                                                   The project will provide opportunities for practical                            engineering advances as well as fundamental advances in                         understanding chemical reaction processes in supercritical                      fluids.",
