 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent evidence suggests that the alpha-subunit of the Na-pump has              glycan moieties exposed to the cytosolic side of the plasma                     membrane of animal cells.  A novel aspect of these glycans is that              they are sensitive to peptide N-glycosidase F, a phenomenon not                 previously noted, and suggestive of a topology that can not be                  explained by current notions of glycoprotein biosynthesis and                   insertion into plasma membrane.  This project is aimed at                       elucidating this topology by describing the structure and                       composition of the glycans, determining where in the cell they are              synthesized and attached to protein, and establishing to which                  amino acid(s) of the Na-pump the sugar molecules are bound.  These              studies may be expected to lead to an understanding of how it is                that the carbohydrate moieties of the glycoproteins become                      positioned on the cytosolic side of the membrane.                                                                                                               The finding of an apparently novel topography of the Na-pump that               plays a key role in the functions of cell membranes raises                      fundamental questions about the chemical nature of this particular              membrane glycoprotein and the site and means by which the                       glycosylation occurs.  The research planned is aimed at enlarging               our understanding both of protein glycosylation and the role of                 oligosaccharides in membrane glycoprotein functions.                              //",
