 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feng         Hypercube and multistage interconnection network (MIN)-based  architectures are two promising classes of parallel computers  that have received considerable attention in recent years.  The  objective of this research is to develop analytical evaluation  techniques for predicting performance, dependability, and  performance-related dependability behavior of these two classes  of multiprocessors.  The performance model is based on a three-level approach -  network level, task (job) level, and system level.  The network  level analysis gives the average communication delay which can be  used in finding job completion time at the task level.  Using the  job completion time, system level parameters such as throughput  and response time could be computed from an appropriate queing  model.  Dependability analysis  would consider the degradation of  the computing elements and communication network for finding  task-based reliability or availability.  The dependability model  is aimed at finding a proper subcube for the execution of a task.   The analysis covers both unique-path and multi-path MINs.   Performance-related dependability models are being developed by  associating suitable performance measures with the structure  states of a multiprocessor.  This project will make available a  complete set of tools for analyzing these two classes of  multiprocessors that have a great promise for different  applications.",
