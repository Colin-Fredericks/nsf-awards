 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leading geographers from the Association of American                            Geographers together with secondary school teachers will                        produce a curriculum materials package for use in existing                      and emerging social science classes in the secondary                            schools.  The materials will focus on population, patterns,                     economic regionalization and political geography as factors                     that shape the pattern of human-environment interaction                         throughout the nation.  The aim is a broad contextual                           understanding of environmental issues with particular                           emphasis on the kinds of global problems that require                           coordinated action at the global, regional and local levels.                    The materials will consist of a concise geography text, a                       set of classroom and individual student activities, related                     readings, and a detailed teachers' manual.  Student                             assessment instruments will also be developed.  The                             materials will incorporate features that reflect trends in                      several aspects of the secondary curriculum as recommended                      by \"Guidelines for Geographic Education,\" the NCTM                              Standards, the report, \"Charting a Course:  Social Studies                      Curriculum for the 21st Century\" published by the National                      Commission on Social Studies in Schools.  Formative                             evaluation will be conducted by an outside expert and the                       network of Geographic Alliances will play a central role in                     materials dissemination and teacher enhancement.",
