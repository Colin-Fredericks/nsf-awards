Attendance of                these scientists at an interdisciplinary meeting dedicated to                   reporting the latest research accomplishments in this important                 area of photosynthesis will lead to enhancement of our                          understanding of pyrrole function in the photosynthetic process.                                                                                                The harvesting of radiant (light) energy and its conversion to                  chemical forms in the form of plant and bacterial biomass is the                primary and fundamentally important way by which energy for support             of life processes on this planet occurs.  Pyrroles are key chemical             components of the biological apparatus that brings about this                   conversion of radiant energy to that in chemical bonds.  The                    formation and function of these important chemicals is the focus                of this meeting experts dedicated to such studies.//",
