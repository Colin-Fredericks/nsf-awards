 "awd_abstract_narration": "The abundant deposits of Oligo-miocene amber from southern                 Mexico and Hispaniola have yielded a great diversity of exquisitely             preserved biological inclusions, the large majority being                       arthropods and especially Diptera.  The amber specimens afford an               unparalleled opportunity to address questions on the relationships              and origins of the Caribbean fauna, but critical information is                 lacking on the distributions of most extant Diptera in the                      caribbean, and the phylogenetic relationships of the amber fossil               taxa to living species.                                                              This research proposes to examine selected groups represented              in the amber collections the AMNH and the NMNH: Asteia (Asteiidae),             Aulacigaster (Aulacigastridae), Beckeriella (Ephydridae),                       Beebeomyia (Richardiidae), Carnus/Meoneura (Carnidae),                          Lygistorrhina and Proceroplatus (Mycetophilidae), Diathoneura and               selected Drosophila groups (Drosophilidae), Odinia (Odiniidae), and             a species group within Pholeomyia (Milichiidae).  Taxonomic                     revisions of each will be based on species-level treatments using               adult morphology and cladistic methodology to examine phylogenetic              relationships.  Study will resort to pinned museum specimens but                requires extensive sampling using several general and specific                  collecting techniques in lowland tropical forests, which is                     proposed for Hispa ola, Cuba, and Costa Rica.  Gas                              chromatography/mass spectroscopy will be done by a collaborator on              selected amber specimens to more accurately determine their                     geological provenance.  Aims of the research are the following:                 define species and their distributions for the above groups in the              Netropics; test for repeated, congruent patterns of distributions;              and place the fossils among the phylogenetic system of extant                   species.  Implications of these results are that distributions can              be examined for correspondence to island origins (vicariance), and              the minimum, fossil age of a clade may provide permissive evidence              for or refute a particular geological explanation.  Also, the role              of geographical extinctions in modifying distributions can be                   assessed, which is directly applicable to vicariance methodology.",
