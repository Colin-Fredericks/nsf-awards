 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted on properties of flux lines in                       superconductors and on localization, multiple scattering and                    interference of waves in disordered media.  For the first topic,                investigations will be undertaken on the nature of the                          quasiparticle excitations in the mixed state of a type II                       superconductor with a view to determining whether de Haas van                   Alphen oscillations can be observed and thus provide information on             the Fermi surface of high temperature superconductors.  Research                will also be undertaken on the properties of disordered flux line               arrays near the upper critical field using an appropriate                       variational order parameter.  The properties of flux lines in thin              films with applied field parallel to the surface will also be                   studied with the objective of understanding recent vibrating reed               experiments.  For the second topic, localization of light, the                  scattering of light by a disordered medium will be studied when the             scattering is predominately small angle scattering.  This approach              leads to some interesting simplifications.  The behavior appears to             be dominated by interference effects.  Understanding and                        calculating these effects is one objective of the proposed                      research.                                                                       %%%                                                                             The research conducted on this grant focusses on two areas of                   current interest in condensed matter and materials physics.  In the             first area, the fundamental properties of magnetic flux lines in                type II superconductors, such as the recently discovered high                   temperature superconductors, will be studied.  While the properties             of flux lines and the structures which they form are of basic                   importance to the underlying physics of these superconductors, they             are also of great importance to the production of real                          superconducting materials which have high current densities.  The               second area of research is the localization of waves by disorder.               It has long been known that electrons travelling in disordered                  media, such as an amorphous semiconductor, can be localized due to              the intrinsic disorder in the material.  Of more recent interest is             the discovery of the localization of electromagnetic waves (light)              by disordered materials.  This opens up the possibility of                      designing materials which treats light in the same way as                       semiconductors, say, deal with electrons.  Basic research in this               area can have a large impact on the design and use of photonic                  materials.",
