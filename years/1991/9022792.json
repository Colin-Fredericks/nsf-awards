 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an accomplishment-based renewal of the research of one of               the most creative, influential and productive scholars in the                   modern economic theory of industrial organizations.  The primary                emphasis in this project will be on studying the interactions                   between the co-evolution of manufacturing firms, their suppliers,               technologies, and organization forms and on the problems of                     coordination and strategy in the presence of returns to scale,                  complementarities, and \"design dependence.\"  A second emphasis                  will be on the incentives at work in firms and how compensation                 contracts, jobs, authority relations and decision processes are                 designed in light of these problems.  A third emphasis will be on               the evolution of modern institutions for supporting exchanges and               how these affected the evolution of the modern firm.                                                                                                            The first part of the project represents a major new direction of               research that should develop into a fruitful and exciting area of               economic theory.  Research completed under the previous NSF grant               on individual firms provides a new theory of discrete                           organizational design with the extent of communications with                    customers as the major design variable.  Profit maximizing firms                are shown to choose one of two different and complementary                      organizational structures: a low inventory, extensive                           communication organization or a high inventory, low communication               system.  The low inventory firms differ from high inventory firms               in the same environment in that they have higher rates of new                   product introduction, more flexible production technologies                     (e.g., robotics), greater reliance on subcontractors, and more                  general training for workers.  The next phase of the research                   will be to expand this theory to study the evolution of                         manufacturing systems and other activities across firms and                     eventually to develop a rigorous economic theory of the role of                 management.",
