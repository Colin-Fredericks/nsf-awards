 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a collaborative program of research with                    Helio Dias of the University of Sao Paulo and Laercio Losano                    of the Federal University of Paraiba in Brazil and Francisco                    Krmpotic of the University of La Plata in Argentina collab-                     orating with G. E. Brown and T. T. S. Kuo of the State                          University of New York at Stony Brook.  This program will                       calculate and estimate rates of weak interaction relevant to                    the evolution of stars, also rates of two-neutrino and                          neutrinoless double beta decays.  The best available two-body                   matrix elements of the nucleon-nucleaon interaction will be                     used in various large shell model calculations.   In the case                   of stellar evolution, one of the objectives is to obtain                        rates for transitions between excited states of the relevant                    nuclei.                                                                                                                                                         This project will bring the Brazilian and Argentinian work                      into contact with the best effective nuclear interactions and                   provide an improved calculation of electron capture rates                       and beta decays in stellar evolution, as well as double beta                    decay.  The principal investigators in Brazil and Argentina                     are well experienced in shell-model and number-projected                        calculations while the Stony Brook side has had considerable                    experience in stellar evolution, electron capture and single                    and double beta decays.  On the U.S. side, Stony Brook                          graduate students M. Aufderheide and D. B. Stout are already                    involved in this work.  Other graduate students will be                         brought in.  Besides the Brazilian and Argentinean principals,                  a successful research program will certainly influence                          postdoctoral and postgraduate research in the Universities of                   Sao Paulo, Paraiba and La Plata.",
