Project funding will enable the co-investigator from               the University of Ilorin to work for three months time in the                   laboratory of Dr. Rachel Pinker at the University of Maryland.                  The collaborative research will analyze data used to derive                     information on the seasonal variation of sub-Saharan aerosol                    optical depths. Additionally, the co-investigator will visit the                NOAA Environmental Research Laboratories in Boulder, Colorado in                order to become acquainted with the World Climate Research                      Program plans to establish global baseline radiation networks for               monitoring global climate change, and for validating satellite                  retrieval methods.                                                                                                                                              This project in aerosol climatology fulfills the program                        objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Nigeria to combine                     complementary talents and pool research resources in areas                      of strong mutual interest and competence.",
