 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates how information processing within firms               influences their internal organization and their economies of                   scale.  Information processing in a firm takes time; delay is                   costly because old information is not as valuable as new                        information.  It is possible, up to a point, to reduce the delay                in information processing by using more resources.  This project                will determine what delay is attainable for given resources.  It                will be done by modelling the managers of a firm as processing                  elements in a parallel processing computer.                                                                                                                     The investigators have obtained results for non-stochastic arrivals             of data, and these indicate that the hierarchial organization of                information processing is effective.  They will consider explicitly             the firm's decision problems in which the processed information is              used, in order to calculate the cost of delay.  The researchers                 will next determine how the need to process information affects                 returns to scale, given that the amount of information that must                be processed in a firm increases with the size of the firm.  Then               they will study information processing when data arrives                        stochastically, as is most commonly the case except for periodic                accounting data.                                                                                                                                                This pioneering research promises to provide new insights                       concerning the role of information in the organization of firms.                It will also fill an important void in our understanding of                     organizations and markets.",
