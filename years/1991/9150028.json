 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California, Berkeley, seeks funding for a                     five-year program:  A Model Program for the Preparation of                      Mathematics and Science Teachers at the Secondary Level.  The                   project will serve a model Credential-Plus-Master Degree                        program for preservice teachers in mathematics and science                      with research and program development components.                                                                                                               The program for teachers is based on the following premises:                    a solid preparation in mathematics and/or science; knowledge                    of and participation in state-of-the-art research on teaching                   and learning; and extensive experience in the use of                            instructional technology.  The certificate program normally                     takes a year to complete at UC-Berkeley; however, this program                  will include the master level work and a total design change                    from traditional teacher preparation programs.  For example,                    instead of a one-semester student teaching experience, the                      students will work in schools throughout the project.  Senior                   faculty members will be involved in teaching the courses and                    the unifying seminar.  Faculty, graduate students, and                          inservice mentor teachers will work with all aspects of the                     school-based experiences and seminars.  There is an important                   component of professional development and preparation for                       graduate students to become future leaders in mathematics and                   science education.                                                                                                                                              The research component is intended to help mathematics and                      science educators learn more about the preparation of teachers                  in the disciplines and how such a program might be implemented                  elsewhere.  In particular, the research will focus on:  the                     role of videoportfolios in teacher development; how teacher                     beliefs affect their classroom practices, and how those                         beliefs evolve; the effects of the teacher preparation on the                   research and teaching of the graduate faculty; and how the                      \"school cultures\" in the schools where students are placed                      interact with what they study in the program.                                                                                                                   The amount of non-NSF cost-sharing by the University of                         California at Berkeley is 45% of the total budget requested                     from NSF.",
