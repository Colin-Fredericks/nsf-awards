 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of                 the Chemistry Division studies the fundamentals of solvation,                   the interaction of additives with liquids.  Solvation                           properties affect reaction rates and the course of reactions.                   When two or more solvents interact, separation of components is                 based on competitive solvation properties.  Prof. Carr has been                 developing general descriptions of solvation, and this work                     extends his earlier explorations.                                                                                                                               Solvation properties are organized based on Kamlet-Taft scales                  of dipolarity, hydrogen bond acidity, and basicity.  Gas and                    liquid chromatography will be used to measure solvation                         parameters, and then new chromatography columns will be                         evaluated based on knowledge of the previously measured                         parameters.  Extension to characterization of reversed phase                    liquid chromatography will be made.  Free energy scales for                     solvation as a function of acidity and basicity parameters will                 be established.",
