 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frogs are vertebrates with two distinct auditory organs,                   rather than the single cochlea of mammals.  A great deal is known               about frog calling communication behavior, and about the                        physiology of frog auditory systems.  However, unlike the case in               mammals, the anatomical details and ultrastructure of how the                   sensory hair cells are innervated is poorly known.  Such details                are important in forming hypotheses about mechanisms for the                    observed frequency selectivity and physiology of frog hearing.                       This work will use light and electron microscopy to assess                 how the receptor cells are innervated by the auditory nerve in                  both these organs, and then to study the detailed architecture                  of the functional contancts, the synapses, of single nerve fibers               in selected regions where function is known.  The results will be               important not only to comparative aspects of auditory function                  including physiology and behavior among species, but also to                    general principles of frequency coding mechanisms which are                     crucial to auditory neuroscience.",
