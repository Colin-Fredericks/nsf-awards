 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze the effects on market                 prices and market efficiency of learning on the part of individuals             participating in that market.  There is good evidence that                      suppliers and demanders eventually learn enough about the market                to form rational expectations about the market they participant in,             in the sense that they do not persist in making predictable errors              that reduces market efficiency.  The way in which market                        participants learn about a market can affect its efficiency; first              by affecting how quickly participants learn about the market, and               second by affecting equilibrium prices and quantities.  An                      important part of learning about a market is learning about other               suppliers and demanders in the market.  This project will analyze               learning by the use of experimental markets in which suppliers                  determine output before any trades occur.  This production before               sale situation mimics agricultural markets as well as many other                markets in which supplies' forecasts of market prices have an                   important effect on market prices.  The most precise learning                   models are the statistically-based models of Bayesian learning and              regression learning.  In this study the implications of both types              of learning are examined.  This research is important because it                will give us a better understanding of how learning affects the                 efficient functioning of markets.",
