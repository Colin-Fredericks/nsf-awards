 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will convert an extremely complicated problem                      into two more tractable problems and provide initial results                    which point the way for future developments.  The major                         complexity which develops when considering ways that                            associating chains interact with themselves and solvents is                     the coupling between the ways that atoms on the same chain                      screen each other vs. the ways association sites seek to                        overcome this screening.  Screening by itself is complicated                    by considerations of chain length, position on the chain, and                   flexibility of the chain.  Hydrogen bonding is complicated by                   its short-range nature, orientational dependence, the need to                   match donors with acceptors, and the possibilities of forming                   rings or multiple branches.  When these phenomena occur                         together as in many systems of interest to chemical engineers,                  polymer scientists, and molecular biologists, approaches to a                   molecular-based description can become either too cumbersome                    too limited.  To resolve this coupling into the two separate                    components, molecular dynamics computer simulations of hard                     chain molecules with square-well hydrogen bonding sites are                     proposed in conjunction with an integral equation theory of                     chain molecules.  Coordinating these two complementary methods                  will provide a firm basis for making predictions of properties                  like solution viscosity, chain conformation, polymer blending                   miscibility, and solubilities of organic contaminants in                        groundwater.",
