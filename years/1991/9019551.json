 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently a need exists for accurate,                                           dependable microsensors which can                                               communicate to the observer data                                                associated with processes which may be at                                       the molecular level or the parts per billion                                    to trillion range.  Surface acoustic wave                                       (SAW) technology offers one of the most                                         attractive methods to realize the                                               microsensor. The SAW gas microsensor                                            basically consists of twin SAW delay lines.                                     Each line is configured as an oscillator and                                    the propagation path of one contains a                                          selectively sorbent film while the other is                                     the uncoated reference. Phase delay changes                                     induced by the gas sorbed on the film                                           results in frequency shifts which are directly                                  proportional to the gas concentration.                                          An interdisciplinary effort which includes                                      the theory, design, fabrication and testing of                                  SAW devices and the physics and chemistry                                       of surfaces is ongoing at the University of                                     Maine to realize the potential of this sensor.                                  The purpose of the present renewal project                                      is to continue the ongoing experimental and                                     theoretical study of the SAW gas                                                microsensor. The sensing film being used is                                     tungsten trioxide (WO3) and the gas being                                       sensed is hydrogen sulfide (H2S).                                               Microscopic and macroscopic experimental                                        tools are being used in order to study and                                      optimize sensor properties such as                                              selectivity, sensitivity, operating range sensor                                signature, response time, recovery time,                                        reproducibility and aging.",
