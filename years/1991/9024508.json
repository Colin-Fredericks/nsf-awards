 "awd_abstract_narration": "The surface science techniques of Auger electron spectroscopy,                  low energy electron diffraction, ultraviolet photoelectron                      spectroscopy, alkali ion scattering spectroscopy and forward                    focusing angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy will                   be used to examine ultrathin films and monolayers.  The systems                 to be studied include palladium films.   Studies will be                        carried out of the effect of various gases, including carbon                    monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ethylene and                          acetylene, on the film properties using primarily high                          resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and temperature                    programmed desorption.   Kinetic studies will be performed and                  some catalytic reactions will be examined.   The analytical                     probes used have the ability to probe subtle changes in the                     geometric and electronic structure of the materials studied,                    and should enable a better understanding of chemisorption and                   reactivity to be obtained.                                                                                                                                      %%%                                                                             The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                     Chemistry, focuses on surface science studies of monolayers and                 ultrathin films of palladium on early transition metal single                   crystal substrates.  The study aims to correlate these studies                  with the chemisorption and reaction properties of the films.                    The work promises to lead to a greater understanding of the                     properties of thin metal films which will have a wide range of                  important applications in materials science and catalysis.",
