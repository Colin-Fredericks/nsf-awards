 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies have revealed many interesting structural                   properties of kanban controlled serial systems.  These properties               suggest procedures for efficient card allocation, estimation of                 throughput and other inventory related measures.  The efficacy of               kanban control policies for systems with stage failures and limited             repairs has not, however, yet been studied.                                          Stage failures, limited repair and schedule of repair may                  affect the system throughput via unavailability of the stages along             with adverse bowl and variance effects.  Investigation of such                  systems is already under way resulting in a robust probability                  model that yields an expression of throughput.  This research                   extends current frontiers by focusing on the following topics:  (a)             effect of repair schedule on system performance, (b) throughput                 estimation of decomposition, and (c) kanban allocation limit.  The              outcomes of this research will provide tools for more efficient                 design and control of serial production systems.",
