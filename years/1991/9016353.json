 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in physical                      chemistry between Dr. Daniel Kivelson, University of California                 at Los Angeles and Dr. Gilles Tarjus, University of Pierre                      and Marie Curie, Paris, France.  The objective of the project                   is to develop a microscopic description of friction in                          liquids.                                                                                                                                                        The investigators are studying the motions of molecules in                      liquids, with particular emphasis on the motion of a reacting                   group traversing an activation barrier during a chemical                        reaction.  In liquids the surrounding fluid plays an important                  role, not only in altering the activation energy, but also as                   a source of friction in determining all molecular motions.                      The project will focus on this frictional effect.  Since                        friction is a macroscopic concept, they will seek to understand                 under what conditions it can validly and usefully be applied                    in describing dynamics at the molecular level.  They will                       also explore how the frictional concept, extended if needed,                    to give a better microscopic description, can yield insights                    into chemical kinetics in liquid solution.  Their approach                      will be both theoretical and computational.  The results of                     this research should contribute to the understanding of                         frictional effects in liquids, particularly those connected                     with chemical reactions.  Understanding chemical kinetics on                    a molecular level is one of the most fundamental problems in                    chemistry.  Dr. Kivelson has been a leader in the area of                       studying molecular motions in liquids, particularly rotational                  motions, for many years, and he will benefit from the                           complementary expertise of Dr. Tarjus in the proposed research.",
