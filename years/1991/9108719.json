 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Fantino will carry out experiments to investigate choice                    behavior.  All are relevant to his delay-reduction theory of                    choice, which states that performance for a stimulus may be                     predicted most accurately by calculating the reduction in the                   length of time to reinforcement correlated with the onset of the                stimulus in question relative to the length of time to                          reinforcement measured from the onset of the trial.  In other                   words, the greater the improvement in terms of temporal proximity               or waiting time to reinforcement, correlated with the onset of a                stimulus, the more preferred that stimulus will be.  The                        experiments are to assess potentially important modifications of                this theory.  For example, it has never been ascertained whether                the effectiveness of a stimulus in delay-reduction terms is                     predicted most accurately by calculating the reduction in the                   time to reinforcement measured from the onset of the preceding                  stimulus or by calculating the reduction in the time to                         reinforcement measured relative to the average time to primary                  reinforcement in the situation.  These experiments will assess                  those questions which are central to an appreciation of response                strength.  The second set of experiments will explore the                       adequacy of delay-reduction in accounting for choice in                         situations where the theory predicts nonoptimal behavior.  The                  third set of experiments includes a novel extension of the theory               to conditional discrimination problems, in which Dr. Fantino will               asses the effectiveness of two conflicting sources of information               on choice.  This section also should help illuminate the factors                governing base-rate errors reported in judgment tasks.  Topics                  such as reinforcement and choice--including nonoptimal decision-                making--have relevance for health concerns.",
