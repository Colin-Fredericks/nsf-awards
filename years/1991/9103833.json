 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on partial differ-                     ential equations and complex variables between Dr. Francois                     Treves of Rutgers University and Dr. P. D. Cordaro of the                       University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.  The work will                      investigate the existence of local solutions in the differ-                     ential complexes originating from commuting systems of                          complex vector fields (on a smooth real manifold).  Recently                    Cordaro and Treves have obtained general necessary conditions,                  at least when the rank of the characteristic set is . 1.                        Cordaro & Treves are currently  investigating the possibility                   of proving sufficient conditions, in particular in the                          important case of Cauchy-Riemann structures.  There is a                        natural conjecture that awaits proof, in the case of top-degree                 forms:  local solvability ought to hold if the Levi form is                     not definite (positive or negative) at any point.                                                                                                               This type of result is an essential part of the completion of                   the theory of hypo-analytic structures that has been building                   for the last ten years, through the efforts of Treves and his                   collaborators.  The award will allow Cordaro & Treves to get                    together at regular intervals to work on this project.                          Cordaro has funds from CNPq NSF's corresponding agency in                       Brazil to visit Rutgers University.  Treves and a graduate                      student will visit Sao Paulo in return.",
