 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) will carry out               an evaluation study of the calculus reform movement in the United               States.  This evaluation study will include current efforts in                  colleges and universities to generate a reform movement and, in                 particular, will consider the NSF calculus initiative as a model                for future curriculum initiatives.                                                   Information collected will include factual data on a wide                  variety of projects including all NSF funded projects.  An in-depth             study of a carefully selected sample of projects will include site              visits and on-site data gathering.                                                   Key issues to be addressed will include outcomes of individual             projects, long term continuation of projects, dissemination and                 integration of results and future directions.  Simultaneously, the              effectiveness of NSF's program, as a factor in the reform movement,             will be studied as a model for promoting curricular reform.                          Regular reports will be made to the mathematics community and              to other science disciplines.  Since the NSF initiative in calculus             is a large factor in the reform movement, and since this study is               of interest to NSF staff, NSF will be included as a recipient of                these regular reports.                                                               Cost sharing on this award is $17,000 or 9%.//",
