 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies stability of solutions of some                    reaction-diffusion equations that lck compactness or Liapunov                   functionals.  Here specific issues include optimal conditions on                the initial value for global existence of a solution, limiting                  sets of global solutions, and topologies in which equilibria or                 traveling waves are stable.  He also studies point-concentration                phenomena of solutions of elliptic equations in unbounded                       domains.  The rates and locations of concentration are among the                main questions.                                                                      All the equations studied are model equations from                         biology, chemistry, or mathematical physics.  Better                            understanding of these important equations provides insight into                the underlying scientific questions.  But a thorough study of the               equations is difficult because of a lack of general tools to deal               with nonlinear equations. Hence the problems and techniques for                 solving them are of intrinsic mathematical interest also.",
