 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will consider problems in the theory of partial               differential equations related to quasiregular mappings in                      Euclidean space of dimension at least 3, in an attempt to extend                to higher dimensions some aspects of classical function theory.                 The underlying potential theory in Euclidean space is nonlinear                 and harmonic functions are replaced by solutions of certain                     quasilinear equations which are invariant in a certain sense                    under quasiregular mappings.  Quasiconformal mappings are well                  suited to be studied with analytic methods via these quasilinear                elliptic equations. They are closed under composition, making                   them very useful in Topology and Geometry.  These studies are                   important in the mathematical modelling of non-newtonian fluids                 and creep of metals.  Further connections to benefit applied                    science as well as pure mathematics will be sought.",
