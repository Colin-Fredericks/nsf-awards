 "awd_abstract_narration": "Until now species concept in lichens has necessarily been                  based solely upon morphology and secondary-product chemistry.  No               parent/progeny information for the lichens existed prior to our                 recent demonstration of reproductive isolation and gene flow.                   Using the methodology developed in that study, we are examining                 five chemotypes of the Ramalina siliquosa complex that are starkly              zoned in bands on seashore cliffs in western Europe.  This group                epitomizes a form of variation widespread among the lichens:                    Chemical races with little or no morphological differentiation have             different ecologies where their geographic ranges overlap.  Are                 such chemotypes sibling species or polymorphisms within                         morphological species?  Since hybridization cannot yet be tested                in lichen by artificial crossing, we are culturing the progeny of               different chemotypes that grew side by side where zones overlap.                If chemotypes are conspecific and freely interbreed, then the                   progeny of these haploid organisms will often match a chemotype                 different from the maternal one.  The results of this study will                offer a guide to the interpretation of many hundreds of similar                 chemotypes of lichens already will documented.  Additionally, the               methodologies developed here will make possible a new dimension of              experimental research in the systematics of the lichen-forming                  fungi.",
