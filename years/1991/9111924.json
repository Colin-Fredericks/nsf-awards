 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies models where variations in the markup of                   price over marginal cost is a central component of the                          explanation of business cycles.  The theoretical rigor and the                  empirical validity of imperfect competition models of business                  cycles will be determined.  This research should provide valuable               insights into the relationship between macroeconomic activity and               microeconomic industry structure.                                                                                                                               More specifically, time series for markup variation will be                     constructed for both the private sector as a whole and for 4-                   digit manufacturing industries.  Various procedures are proposed                to check the plausibility of the theoretical models.  For                       instance, if markup variations as a result of imperfect                         competition explain business cycles, such markup variation should               be more pronounced in relatively concentrated sectors.  In                      addition, different models of markup variation have different                   implications for how the current level of sales and the expected                future level of profits affect markups.  Both aggregate and                     disaggregated data contain information about the way these                      variables affect markups.  The extent to which aggregate demand                 influences output through the variables that determine markups in               the models (current sales and the present value of future                       profitability) will also be ascertained.  Finally, the output                   volatility that changes in these variables induce through changes               in the markup will be measured.",
