 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, Mr. Yonathan                 Mizrachi will collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  He                   will conduct archaeological excavations at the site of Rujm el-                 Hiri, a megalithic monument located in northern Israel.  The site               consists of a massive carefully constructed central cairn ca 20                 m. in diameter encircled by several concentric stone circles.                   These concentric walls have two monumental entryways and are                    connected in some spots by radial walls.  The area immediately                  surrounding the site is dotted with hundreds of smaller cairns,                 dolmens (free standing stones) and stone walls.  The complex,                   which is unique, probably dates to the Bronze Age, ca. the 3rd                  millenium B.C.  With National Science Foundation support, Mr.                   Mizrachi will continue his excavation of the site.  His goals are               to reconstruct the chronology, stratigraphy and overall cultural                sequence and to identify the primary and secondary functions of                 the complex.  He also hopes to clarify the relationship between                 the core of the complex and features in its immediate periphery.                                                                                                In last season's work, Mr. Mizrachi conducted a radar survey of                 the central cairn and located several burial chambers, the first                of which he excavated.  He will direct a more detailed radar                    survey and excavate additional chambers.  He will also conduct                  excavations in selected areas around the cairn in an attempt to                 determine how different portions of the site were used and to                   learn whether they were occupied simultaneously.                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  The Near East                  marks one of the cradles of civilization.  Within this region,                  one can trace the origins of plant and animal domestication and                 the development of increasing social complexity.  The Bronze Age                marks a stage of this process. Using archaeological data and                    adopting a dichronic perspective one can gain insight into how                  complex societies function.  Excavation at Rujm el-Hiri will                    provide unique information relevant to this goal.  The project                  will also assist in the training of an extremely promising young                scientist.",
