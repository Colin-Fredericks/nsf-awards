 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Joseph L. Katz of Johns Hopkins University                  for collaborative research in chemical engineering with                         Professor Friedrich Hensel of Phillips University in Marburg,                   Germany.  They are cooperating in a study that involves the                     use of upward thermal diffusion chambers to measure the                         homogeneous nucleation of cesium and other metal vapors.                        Their research plan exploits the complementary strengths of                     the two research groups.  The German group led by Dr. Hensel                    is well known for their research on the metal-insulator                         transition and other properties of metal vapors.  They have                     state-of-the-art facilities where they are actively studying                    supersaturated mercury vapor.  Dr. Katz and his group are                       expert in the use of the diffusion cloud chamber and in                         nucleation theory.  They have a very active program using                       upward thermal diffusion cloud chambers for the study of                        homogeneous and other nucleations.  Most of the experimental                    work will be done in Marburg, with some data analysis and                       other support going on in Maryland.  Reciprocal visits of                       members of the two research groups will facilitate this joint                   work.                                                                                                                                                           Nucleation processes are extremely widespread in the natural                    world as well as in the laboratory.  However, our ability to                    predict the conditions that cause nucleation and the rate at                    which it occurs in typical processes is almost non-existent.                    Homogeneous nucleation of a liquid from its supersaturated                      vapor is particularly amenable to theoretical and experimental                  study.  The nucleation properties of metals are quite                           different from those of non-metals, and they are of growing                     importance as technologies develop to produce and use novel                     alloys or to use known metals in novel ways.",
