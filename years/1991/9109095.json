 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will study                      systematically the zeros of orthogonal Laurent polynomials (L-                  polynomials) related to strongly positive-definite moment                       functionals.  This study will parallel the study of the zeros of                classical orthogonal polynomials.  In particular, the principal                 investigator will look at the separation properties of the zeros                and establish the connection between the zeros and the spectrum of              a natural representative of the polynomials.  She will also study               the relationship between the zeros and the true interval of                     orthogonality of the L-polynomials.                                                  The theory of classical orthogonal polynomials is rich in                  mathematical content and in applications' value to a host of                    problems in approximation theory, numerical analysis and                        differential equations.  In this the project the principal                      investigator will attempt to construct an analogous theory for a                class of generalized orthogonal polynomials called Laurent                      polynomials.  In particular, she will study the properties of the               zeros of such polynomials, in order to broaden the mathematical                 theory of these objects and to explore exciting applications of                 Laurent polynomials in approximation theory.//",
