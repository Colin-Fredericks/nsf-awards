 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Lee Cassanelli, Ms Kathleen Ryan will                collect ethnographic data for her doctoral dissertation.  She                   will conduct two seasons of field research with Massai                          pastoralists in southern Kenya to study herd management                         strategies. The Massai depend on cattle for subsistence and                     maintain large herds of animals.  Ms Ryan wishes to know what, at               a traditional level of subsistence, are the constraints which                   such herds impose and what constitute the most successful                       management strategies.  During a preliminary field season, she                  has obtained permission to work with traditional Massai groups.                 She plans to examine herd compositions in terms of animal age and               sex distribution.  She will also look at culling strategies which               are employed, labor requirements for care of animals, how cattle                are redistributed and exchanged through bridewealth, inheritance                and other practices.  The redistributive effect of cattle raiding               will also be studied.  Finally, Ms Ryan will examine Massai                     strategies to deal with cattle disease and other disasters.                                                                                                     While the data collected will be ethnographic, the goals of this                research are archaeological in nature.  Cattle were first                       domesticated ca. 10,000-12,000 years ago and they formed the                    subsistence base for prehistoric societies in many parts of the                 Old World.  During some time periods in areas such as Ireland,                  cattle played a major role in shaping social organization and Ms                Ryan believes that one can begin with cattle themselves,                        determine the requirements for a successful management strategy,                and on this basis gain insight into human social practices.                     Since the Maasai rely so heavily on cattle they provide an ideal                context to examine relationships of this type.                                                                                                                  This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data which may be generalizable to many contexts and therefore be               of interest to many archaeologists.  It will yield insights into                present day African subsistence practices and will assist in the                training of a promising young scientist.",
