 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support field collaboration between Frederick                   Frey of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and D.                        Delpino of the Servicio Geologico Nacional in Argentina.  The                   project aims to sample recent lavas erupted east of the                         active Andean volcanic front from 35 degrees to 37 degrees S                    in Argentina, in order to understand volcanism in the southern                  Andes and the pertinent volcanic rocks erupted in Chile and                     Argentina.                                                                                                                                                      The fieldwork and sampling are located in regions that have                     been mapped by Delpino and colleagues, but the recent                           volcanic features have not been sampled for detailed                            geochemical studies.  There are two principal reasons for                       studying these lavas erupted 500-200 km east of the active                      Andean volcanic front:  (1) it is likely that the MgO-rich                      alkaline basalts erupted in Argentina east of the front more                    directly reflect their mantle source composition than the                       relatively evolved lavas which form the stratovolcanoes on                      the front; (2) by studying lavas erupted at varying distances                   across the strike of the front, researchers can define                          geochemical trends as a function of distance from the Chile                     trench.  With this information, they expect to develop new                      constraints on the sources and processes involved in creating                   this portion of the Andean volcanic arc.  The U.S. side has                     geochemical analytical and interpretive expertise in                            understanding the origin and evolution of volcanic rocks.                       The Argentines have expertise in field volcanology and in                       local geology and logistics.",
