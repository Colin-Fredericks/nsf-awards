 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Visualizations for Teaching Mathematics project                    is a three-year effort initiated by the California State                        University at Northridge to help secondary school teachers                      incorporate a visual emphasis in the teaching of pre-algebra                    through precalculus. The project will serve teachers from the                   Los Angeles area. Two cadres of 40 teachers will participate                    in a two-year project, with overlap in the second summer and                    the second and third academic years. Teachers will be involved                  in a three-week summer institute and a series of academic year                  followup activities, including monthly meetings and a winter                    institute; a week-long followup is included in the second                       summer. The project will introduce teachers to three different                  experimental programs ( the Alhambra High School IBM Network                    for Mathematics and Science Project, the W.M. Keck Curriculum                   Project, and the Ohio State Enhancing Mathematics Through                       Technology program.) Participants' administrators will attend                   a portion of the program. Schools will contribute released                      time and calculators for their participants. Other cost                         sharing is provided by the University, the Los Angeles Unified                  School District, the Keck Foundation, IBM, and Texas                            Instruments.                                                                                                                                                    Cost sharing is provided as approximately 40% of the NSF                        award.",
