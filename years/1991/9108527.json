 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Rhode Island and Johns Hopkins University                     will undertake a collaborative, multidisciplinary instru-                       mentation development project to develop and implement a                        means of increasing capabilities to resolve interactions                        betweenparticles and small scale physical processes in the                      ocean by simultaneously measuring particle properties and                       small scale motions of the fluid surrounding it.                                                                                                                The project involves laser optic holography and fluid                           mechanics methods to derive information about plankton                          dynamics and particle characterization.  A pulsed ruby laser                    holocamera will be modified for use in the ocean and will                       use recent advances in holography and digital image                             processing. Design criteria call for in situ measurement of                     particle number, size, distribution, type, and orientation                      and inter-particle distances over a size range of 10 microns                    to 5 cm. Instantaneous velocity of all particles within a                       sample volume would also be measured by adapting triple-                        pulse techniques used for motion sensing within laser                           sheets.  The proposed instrument will be usable in the                          laboratory or in the field, when attached to a submersible.                                                                                                     The development of a motion sensing holocamera is driven by                     a growing recognition that a new class of instruments is                        required to address a series of critical questions in ocean                     science and marine fluid mechanics.  Presently available                        instrumentation is inadequate to address and test hypotheses                    concerning complex physical-particle interactions of                            plankton dynamics and boundary layer fluid dynamics.",
