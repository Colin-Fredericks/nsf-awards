 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theoretical study of how stars form from collapsing stellar gas             clouds is fraught with difficulties because of the array of                     physical processes that affect the collapse.  One such process is               the interaction of rapidly infalling gas onto the star and its                  surrounding circumstellar disk.  The Principal Investigator (PI)                will compute hydrodynamic models of this infall, and the reaction               of the disk to it.  The expected results are that the infall energy             will be converted to reradiation disk heating.  Ultimately, this                heating will stop the infall entirely.  These results will be used              to determine how massive a collapsing star can be.  The PI also                 will determine the effects of the nuclear detonation of deuterium               (heavy hydrogen) within the proto-star, which will lead to revised              estimates of the luminosity distribution of protostars.  Finally,               the PI will determine the distribution of masses of young stars,                working backwards from the observed distribution of luminosities                of stars in young clusters.  All these computations will aid in the             interpretation of the rapidly growing core of data on young stars               and will clarify the physical processes involved as young                       \"protostars\" collapse into visible stars.",
