The proposed research will examine how families were affected by                the separation and subsequent reunion in connection with Operation              Desert Shield.  The investigators propose to use attachment theory              to predict individual differences in patterns of reacting to the                stresses of separation and in the ways of handling the experience               of reunion.  The investigators have secured access to the South                 Carolina National Guard and Reserve Units allowing them to examine              systematically how deployment and subsequent reunion affects                    families.  The research design includes a baseline survey completed             during the period of separation as wells as two measurements during             the reunion period. The investigators have completed the baseline               survey of the spouses of 600 deployed and 290 non-deployed members              of the National Guard and Reserve Unites.  The follow up studies                are planned to take place 2-4 weeks after re-union, and                         approximately 6 months after reunion.                                                                                                                                The proposed research provides a unique opportunity for                    examining the effects of war duty on the families that are left                 behind.  In addition, the research promises to enhance our                      understanding of the ways in which different styles of attachment               influence the ways in which men and women deal with the absence of              their spouse and with the subsequent reunion.",
