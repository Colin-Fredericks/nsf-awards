 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Arkansas                  at Fayetteville, is using a differential scanning calorimeter                   to establish the first material science experiments in two                      undergraduate lab courses and to create a laboratory component                  in a polymers lecture course.  Currently, the curriculum is                     deficient in materials science offerings relative to the                        importance of this area and the establishment of these                          experiments is an integral part of the department's current                     plans for expansion into material science education.  It is                     intended to introduce students to this pervasive area so that                   they may be aware of their opportunities in related fields such                 as polymers, microelectronics, catalysis and other solid-state                  subdisciplines.  The differential scanning calorimeter was                      selected because it provides the largest number of useful                       experiments in the general area of materials science available                  in a single, expandable system.  All undergraduates are exposed                 to it in the sophomore and senior level lab courses, and it is                  also used in a polymers course.",
