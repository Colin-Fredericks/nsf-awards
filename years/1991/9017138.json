 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquid-liquid extraction is an important separation process                     and a key step in recently emerging technologies such as                        hydrometallurgical production of non-ferrous metals, treatment                  of dilute waste streams for metal recovery and hazardous waste                  elimination, refining and reprocessing uranium and plutonium                    in the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear waste management, and                     biochemical separations.  It all plays a major role in                          traditional separation such as hydrodesulfurization in the                      petroleum industry.  Industrial scale equipment for                             liquid-liquid extraction include column contactors and                          continuous flow stirred tanks.  There is a lack of measuring                    techniques for column contactors which has been one of the                      reasons for the limited number of control studies for this                      process.  The development of a noninvasive ultrasonic                           technique in the PI's laboratory provides the opportunity of a                  new initiative in the control of the extraction process.                        Also, in situ miniature                                                         phase-separation devices developed at Syracuse University can                   be used in combination with concentration measuring probes                      (e.g., fiber optic, conductivity, refraction probes, etc.) and                  introduce a new possibility for multivariable control and                       on-line optimization.  This work is an attempt to utilize the                   above techniques for a safe, multivariable control of the                       extractors at optimal conditions.  Further, these techniques                    are the impetus for the second objective, to develop a                          multivariable non-linear predictive control algorithm for                       optimal operation.                                                                                                                                              An optimizing control strategy for liquid-liquid extraction                     columns is planned with the objectives of (i) controlling the                   dispersed phase holdup inside the extractor, (ii) ensuring                      safe operation with respect to flooding or phase inversion,                     and (iii) controlling the solute concentration to provide                       optimum extraction efficiency.  The process will be modelled                    by (i) linear models of first order transfer functions with                     dead time, and (ii) nonlinear models of population balance                      equations which include droplet interactions of breakage and                    coalescence.  Both models will be applied for the control of                    the process in the following sequence:                                             - Adaptive gain-scheduling control of the dispersed phase                    holdup  by using linear models, with the objective of showing                   the application of the ultrasonic technique in the control of                   the extraction process.                                                           -  Nonlinear predictive control of the dispersed phase                        holdup without mass transfer by applying the population                         balance equations, to demonstrate the usefulness of physical                    models.                                                                           -  Nonlinear predictive control of the dispersed phase                        holdup    during mass transfer.                                                    -  Multivariable nonlinear predictive control of holdup and                    concentration using the population balance equations in an                    extended formulation to include mass transfer and                               concentrations.",
