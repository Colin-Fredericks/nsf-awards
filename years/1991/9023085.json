 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is widespread agreement among health economists that there                is a persistent empirical association across samples and over time              between years of schooling and health. However, there are several               explanations about why this association occurs. One explanation is              that there is a direct effect with schooling endowing people with               greater knowledge and skills to practice preventive medicine or use             medical care more widely. Another is that schooling enhances health             through allowing access to safe jobs, discouraging smoking and                  encouraging seat belt use and exercise. Others point to the                     possibility that poor health in childhood or adolescence results                in less investment in schooling. Finally, it is suggested that                  unobserved variables such as the rate of time discount is the                   \"true\" cause of both high levels of schooling and good health and               that increased schooling does not lead to better health or slower               deterioration of existing health. This project will develop models              which will allow for testing of many of these hypotheses in                     addition to comparing rates of health returns to schooling across               gender and race.                                                                                                                                                Four large national data sets are used in the project: National                 Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANESI) I and II,                   Epidemiological Followup Survey to NHANESI, and the Panel Study of              Income Dynamics. Several dependent variables relating to health                 will be used: blood pressures, smoking, body mass and early death.              The estimation techniques will take into account self selection                 models, where appropriate. This study will be the first to focus                on the race and gender differences in the correlations between                  schooling and health in the same way that the classic studies                   focused on the gender and race differences in the financial returns             to schooling.",
