 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the 1940s, there has been considerable scholarly interest                 and research on the behavior and decisionmaking processes of the                Supreme Court.  Although scholars disagree on numerous aspects of               Court decisionmaking, almost all operate under some basic                       assumptions about the very nature of the judicial process.  One of              these involves Court behavior in times of external crisis, periods              during which the United States or its nationals are threatened by               the military forces of another state such as wars or other foreign              confrontations and disputes.  The view of most Court scholars is                that the Court is less tolerant of rights and liberties during                  periods of turmoil.  This view has become entrenched in the                     scholarly literature so as to make it part of the \"conventional                 wisdom.\"  Yet, there has been no systematic research to determine               whether the hypothesized impact of crises is a valid portrayal.                                                                                                 This study will test the \"crisis\" thesis which asserts that the                 Court is more intolerant toward issues of individual rights and                 liberties during times of external security crises.  Using a data               base consisting of all cases involving individual rights and                    liberties resolved by the Court since the early 1800s, a number of              known predictors of macro-level behavior will be explored to assess             the relative effect of international crises on decisionmaking.                  Independent variables include measures of current partisan control              of the Court, the presidency, and the Congress; characteristics of              the litigants; and characteristics of the external security crises.                                                                                             This project not only will determine the validity of the crisis                 thesis, but also it will map the contours of this phenomenon and                develop the theoretical propositions upon which it rests.  The                  research imbeds the Supreme Court in a general theory of conflict               and the state and in doing so blends theoretical and methodological             insights about how the state responds internally to conditions of               actual or threatened conflict imposed from beyond its borders.                  Relatedly, the creation of a longitudinal database on the Supreme               Court over approximately seventy-five years will provide the                    opportunity for other scholars to make inroads into understanding               the Court's institutional role and its place within the political               regime as it has evolved and developed over time.  Finally, viewing             governmental processes and behavior through this macro-level                    approach will provide valuable insights into the development of                 legal and political institutions and, in particular, the influence              of transnational conditions.",
