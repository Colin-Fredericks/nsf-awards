 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Novak will                  investigate the design, preparation, and implementation of                      organometallic catalysts for the \"living\" polymerization of                     monomers known to yield stable, helical polymers. Specifically,                 new Ni(I) and Ni(II) catalysts for the polymerization of                        isonitriles will be investigated. Detailed mechanistic studies                  will be performed in an effort to provide the information                       necessary to modify these new catalysts for specific                            applications. The basic premise of Dr. Novak's study is that                    organometallic complexes, which possess versatile coordination                  spheres and oxidation states, can be used to alter the                          reactivity of polymer endgoups in a predictable manner and with                 a high degree of precision. Depending upon the requirements of                  the particular reaction, the organometallic species may be                      called upon to either activate or deactivate the polymer                        endgroup. Dr. Novak's study is designed to provide a means by                   which endgroups can be rendered unreactive toward all processes                 other than the desired initiation and propagation steps that                    lead to polymer formation.                                                      %%%                                                                             The ultimate polymerization catalysts for the controlled                        synthesis of well-defined macromolecules are \"living\". Living                   polymerizations can be used to synthesize macromolecules with                   pre-determined molecular weights, narrow chain-length                           distributions, and defined endgroups. In addition, living                       systems allow the precise synthesis of \"block copolymers\",                      which offer a combination of properties unobtainable from                       simple polymer blends or random copolymers. Dr. Novak will                      utilize this approach for controlled synthesis of polyiso-                      nitriles, an important class of soluble polymers. In addition,                  the living nature of his approach will be exploited in the                      preparation of novel di- and tri-block copolymers, which are of                 interest as a new class of thermoplastic elastomers.",
