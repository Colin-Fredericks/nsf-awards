The               phenomenon is to be studied in intensive detail from a variety of               disciplines, aiming at a unified theory and database of how the                 system works computationally, how it is learned, how it varies                  represented in the brain.  A key hypothesis is that regular                     inflection (walk-walks) is computed by a very general mental rule               (\"add -ed\") whereas irregular inflection (come-came) involves                   memorization of two separate words in an associative memory,                    allowing limited generalization only to similar-sounding words.                 This hypothesis, which bears on current study of connectionist                  and symbol-processing models of cognition, predicts that regular                and irregular inflection should dissociate in a variety of ways.                The project include tests of how speakers of English and other                  languages apply inflectional patterns to existing and new words,                experiments where subjects produce and recognize inflected forms                in real time, crosslinguistic surveys of universals and variation               in inflectional systems, and model construction.",
