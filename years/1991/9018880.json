 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phloem sieve elements differentiate in tissue cultures of                       Streptanthus tortuosus (Brassicaceae).  The cell walls of the                   callus sieve elements are thicker than the walls of the surrounding             parenchyma cells.  When treated with a solution of cell wall-                   digesting enzymes, the callus parenmchyma cells form wall-less                  protoplasts.  The sieve elements, however, retain their walls                   during this procedure, especially the walls which form sieve plates             between the sieve elements.  As a result, it has been possible to               separate sieve elements from parenchyma cells in these cultures.                Using the sieve element fractions as immunogens, monoclonal                     antibodies directed against the antigens present in sieve elements              have been produced.  The monoclonal antibodies were screened for                reactivity with phloem cells in frozen sections of S. tortuosus                 callus tissue.  These antibodies will be used to identify phloem-               specific proteins using immunoblotting techniques and to identify               specific sieve element organelles and membranes that contain the                identified proteins.  Since the antibodies are also able to cross-              react with sections of Arabidopsis plant tissues, the antibodies                will be used to screen an Arabidopsis expression library in order               to identify phloem-specific genes.                                                                                                                              Specialized cells known as phloem sieve elements play a vital role              in the biology of higher plants.  These conducting elements are                 responsible for passage of nutrients from leaves to non-                        photosynthetic organs such as roots and meristems.  In addition,                long-distance transport of assimilates is a key step in the                     movement of nutrients into the harvestable grains, fruits, and                  tubers that form the basis of agriculture.  Despite the critical                role that these cells play in higher plants, many key aspects of                phloem development, structure and function remain to be determined.             The proposed research will address the basic cell biology of phloem             sieve elements.  The phloem-specific antibodies that will be                    produced in this study should allow new approaches to determining               the genetic basis of phloem development and function.",
