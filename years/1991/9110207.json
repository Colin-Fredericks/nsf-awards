 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on elections has concentrated on the behavior and choices              of individual voters.  However, questions about the roles played                by candidates and their campaigns as influences on voters typically             have been ignored.  Yet voter choice can only be understood within              the context of a campaign and is properly conceived as a result at              least in part of a contest between competing candidates.  This                  innovative research attempts to measure the impact of campaign                  strategies on voter choice in U.S. Senate elections.                                                                                                            Specifically, this research will collect data on the campaign                   behavior of US Senate candidates in the 1988, 1990 and 1992                     elections.  Candidate activities and positions will be determined               based on newspaper coverage of the campaigns.  These data will be               merged with data on voter attitudes in these campaigns thus                     permitting assessments of the extent to which candidate positions               are perceived by voters and influence their decisions.                                                                                                          When completed this study will greatly enhance our understanding                of the impact of campaigns on voter choice including the impact of              negative campaigning and of campaigns in which candidates offer                 choices, not echoes.",
