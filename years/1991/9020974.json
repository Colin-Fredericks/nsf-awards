 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to clarify the relationship of                dental development patterns to the life histories of anthropoid                 primates as well as increasing our knowledge of growth and                      development in human and non-human primates.                                                                                                                    There has been a long-standing discussion as to the maturation                  rates in human ancestors.  Some feel that their maturation                      resembled tht of modern humans; thus indicating a long period of                childhood dependency in our ancestors.  Others have argued                      against this perspective; holding that their maturation was                     neither human-like, nor ape-like.  The proposed research will                   help to resolve this debate and paint a clearer picture of the                  maturation pattern of earlier humans.                                                                                                                           Four specific projects will be undertaken:                                           1) a comparative study of tooth emergence sequence in                                anthropoids                                                                2) a comparative study of tooth formation patterns in                                anthropoids                                                                3) development of standards for the determination of non-                            human anthropoid age from dental data                                      4) a survey of the literature on the development of                                  mammalian dentition.                                                                                                                                  This basic data is of central to the ability to compare                         development between species.",
