 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new avenue of opportunity in the field of intense,                            ultrashort laser pulse technology and its applications                          has opened as a result of the development of the                                laser materials Cr-doped LiSAF and Cr-doped                                     LiCAF.  These materials, like no others yet                                     developed, display the most attractive characteristics                          of a solid state laser material required for the                                generation of ultra-intense, ultrashort laser pulses.                           They have high gain and energy storage properties,                              good optical properties, a high damage threshold and                            can be grown in large sizes.  Moreover, they uniquely                           combine long fluorescence lifetimes (  70 us for                                LiSAF and 130 us for LiCAF) and the broadest                                    spectral emission bandwith known (220nm for                                     LiSAF), making possible, for the first time, the                                amplification with high gain, of ultrashort (< 100fs)                           pulses with flashlamp-pumped, large diameter, solid                             state laser modules.  The implications will be                                  considerable for future applications of ultrashort, high                        intensity laser technology, in the development of                               laboratory x-ray lasers, sub-picosecond x-ray studies,                          and particle acceleration.                                                                                                                                      We will make a comprehensive investigation of all the                           physical properties of these two materials associated                           with their use as high gain amplifiers of ultrashort                            laser pulses.  This will include a full examination of                          the basic spectral and atomic properties of Cr-doped                            LiSAF and LiCAF pertaining to broadband pulse                                   amplification, their capacity to amplify short pulses,                          the effectiveness with which chirped pulse                                      amplification (CPA) can extract energy, and those                               material properties affecting their use in wide                                 aperture, multi-segmented array (MSA) amplifiers.                               This study will therefore address all the issues                                necessary to incorporate these new materials as a                               major laser amplifier medium.  Armed with data                                  produced by this study, we will then be able, in future                         work, to move forward towards the construction of                               lasers capable of emitting tens, perhaps hundreds of                            joules in times of less than 100fs, focusable to                                intensities greater than 1020W/cm2.",
