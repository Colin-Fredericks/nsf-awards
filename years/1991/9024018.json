 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to                Dr. Marcia J. Rieke of the Steward Observatory, University of                   Arizona.  The NSF Faculty Award for Women Scientists and                        Engineers recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in                teaching and scholarship as well as the potential for continued                 significant contributions to scientific research, the academic                  profession, and the education of future scientists.                                                                                                             A period of rapid technological growth in infrared detectors for                use in astronomy is allowing astronomers to address problems that               could only be dreamed about five years ago.  Dr. Rieke will be                  carrying out studies aimed at understanding the formation and                   evolution of galaxies.  This is now possible because of the                     availability of infrared (IR) cameras which operate at                          sensitivity levels far beyond the simple photometry of the past                 decade.                                                                                                                                                         The utility of studying high-redshift galaxies at infrared                      wavelengths stems from the fact that the energy distribution of                 the electromagnetic emissions from galaxies peaks in the infrared               part of the spectrum and hence galaxies appear brightest in the                 infrared at all redshifts.  The infrared emission is sensitive to               the bulk of the stellar population.  Early infrared data on high                redshift galaxies confirms expectations about the nature of the                 stars in these galaxies which of necessity were selected mainly                 from lists of radio galaxies.                                                                                                                                   A new, more sensitive IR camera is being prepared for use, and                  will allow many issues associated with high redshift galaxies to                be addressed.  The long-standing question of whether radio                      galaxies are typical elliptical galaxies and hence suitable for                 use in cosmological work will be the primary study.  Other                      research centering on understanding the nature of galaxies                      observed in deep infrared surveys will be carried out.//",
