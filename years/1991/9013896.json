 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present proposal is directed toward the acquisition of                      virtually continuous, concurrent biogeochemical-physical-                       optical data at a site (0, 140W) in the equatorial Pacific as                   part of the JGOFS program.  Presently, meteorological, current,                 and temperature data are being collected from a mooring at the                  site by Dr. Michael McPhaden of PMEL/NOAA.  Dr. McPhaden's                      measurements at that site will be complemented in this effort                   by placing Multi-Variable Moored Systems (MVMS) at 4 depths                     within the upper 120m on this mooring.  The data collected from                 the MVMS units will include:  currents, temperature,                            conductivity, beam attenuation coefficient, stimulated and                      natural fluorescence, dissolved oxygen, photosynthetically                      available radiation (PAR), spectral upwelling radiance, and                     spectral downwelling irradiance.  Derived variable products                     from the MVMS units and the PMEL current meters and temperature                 recorders will include:  stratification, mixed layer depth,                     mixing time scales, and current shears.  Additional MVMS                        products will include:  the spectral diffuse attenuation of                     light which can be used for computation of the penetrative                      component of solar radiation as well as for bio-optical models,                 particle concentrations, pigment biomass, primary production                    (using several methods), integrated pigment biomass and primary                 production, oxygen respiration and utilization, the flux of                     oxygen across the air-sea interface, and the advection and flux                 of particles and pigments.  The MVMS units would provide                        virtually continuous time series for about 6 months per                         deployment, thus complementing and spanning the planned                         JGOFS/NOAA shipboard studies.",
