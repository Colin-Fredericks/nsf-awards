 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, the Logan Museum of                   Anthropology at Beloit College will conserve its important Old                  World archaeology collection.  It will renovate existing space to               create a clean, secure and environmentally stable storage and                   research area.  The collection will be inventoried and                          reorganized to make it accessible for modern research methods.                  New conservationally sound storage cabinets will be purchased to                house the collections and the extensive original documentation                  will be preserved through archival processing and duplication.  A               guide to documentation will be prepared to enable researchers to                make full use of the resource.                                                                                                                                  The collection consists of Old World archaeological material                    systematically assembled as instructional material for the                      teaching of archaeology to students of Beloit College.  It                      includes over 90,000 individual specimens of stone and bone tools               and faunal remains representing 152 sites in 10 European and                    North African countries. A wide range of time - in excess of one                million years - is represented and it constitutes a valuable                    scientific resource.  Of special significance are European Upper                Paleolithic materials for these include art objects which                       document the emergence of modern human culture.                                                                                                                 Because of the way they have been curated, these specimens are in               danger of deterioration and it is difficult for scientists to                   study them.  With NSF funds the materials will be securely housed               and made maximally available for research.",
