 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to establish a Laboratory School                   for the Study of Human Development on the UCSD campus. The                      Laboratory School is intended to fill the pressing need at UCSD                 for laboratory training of students of Human Development. The                   need for an undergraduate developmental laboratory facility has                 been recognized for many years by both the UCSD administration                  and by the members of the UCSD developmental community.                         However, establishment of a such a facility has been hampered                   by a number of factors, the most serious being the limited                      facilities and resources available at the existing campus day                   care center.  Last year funding was approved by the Chancellor                  for the construction of a new day care facility.  The                           construction of the day care center has provided the                            opportunity for us to build one essential component of the                      Laboratory School, that is, a first-rate observational and                      experimental testing facility.  The Psychology and                              Communication Departments have agreed to provide the additional                 laboratory space needed for activities associated with                          experimental design and analyses.  The Laboratory School has                    been designed around a balanced, well-integrated core                           curriculum of undergraduate courses which will provide students                 with direct exposure to a range of approaches for studying                      human development.  The curriculum offers both laboratory                       courses and opportunities for individual students to                            participate in independent research studies or honors thesis                    projects.  In the initial phase, the Laboratory School will                     focus on development in the preschool and early school-age                      period.  This is the logical starting point both because of                     UCSD faculty expertise in this age period, and because of the                   recent acquisition of resources which will make available an                    excellent facility for testing children in this age range.",
