 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program is made to Dr. M. Frederick Hawthorne of the Chemistry                  Department, University of California at Los Angeles.  The                       research will focus primarily on the synthesis, structural                      characterization, and reactivity of metallacarboranes of                        main-group and lanthanide elements.  Included will be studies                   of metallacarboranes incorporating Mg, Sc, Y, La, Ce, Nd, Gd,                   Lu, Th, and U.  These compounds are expected to exhibit unusual                 structures and high reactivity.  Difficulities in synthesizing                  and characterizing lanthanacarboranes will be overcome by                       complexing the lanthanide to porphyrins or macrocycles.  Alkyl,                 hydride, and polyhydride complexes of the lanthanacarboranes                    will also be synthesized.  New carborane sandwich complexes of                  In, Ge, Sn, Pb, P, As, and Sb will be prepared as will                          low-valent sigma-bonded carborane complexes of Si, Ge, Sn, P,                   and As.  Finally, carborane anions will be used as supports for                 dialkylaluminum cations.                                                        %%%                                                                             The new carborane and metallacarborane species synthesized are                  expected to exhibit new types of bonding and reactivity.  Not                   only will the results increase fundamental understanding of                     main group and cluster compounds, but materials useful for the                  synthesis of additional complexes of this type will be                          developed.  Such compounds gain importance when their potential                 utility for development of electronic or polymeric materials is                 considered.  In addition, the hydride species may be effective                  catalysts for C-H bond activation.",
