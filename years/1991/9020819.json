 "awd_abstract_narration": "BB1 is a software system (knowledge representation, interpreter,                and system-building tools) for building artificial intelligence                 (AI) systems. It embodies a model called the \"dynamic control                   architecture,\" in which an AI system incrementally constructs                   explicit solutions to problems, integrates diverse sources of                   knowledge, and dynamically constructs and modifies explicit                     control plans to guide its reasoning. Previous versions of BB1                  have been licensed to over 100 academic, government, and                        industrial organizations. BB1 version 2.5 introduces new                        featuresthat allow an AI system to: integrate asynchronous                      perception, reasoning, and action processes; dynamically control                perception; reason about temporal phenomena; and guarantee                      response times. These innovations are especially useful for                     research and applications involving dynamic task environments and               real-time constraints, for example, intelligent agents, medical                 monitoring, intelligent tutoring, control of manufacturing                      processes, and control of autonomous vehicles.  This project                    supports distribution of BB1 version 2.5 to others in the                       research community. Activities include: software upgrading,                     testing, and debugging; development of demonstration systems;                   preparation of installation instructions and a user manual;                     distribution of software; and documentation of users and                        applications.",
