 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to apply combined                     biomarker molecular.structural/compound.specific isotopic                       analyses to study of a suite of particulate samples and surface                 sediments from the Black Sea and the Sargasso Sea.  This                        project is aimed at demonstrating that compound.specific carbon                 isotope compositions of particulate organic matter provide                      substantially more information on the sources and processing of                 particulate matter in the water column that can be obtained by                  bulk carbon isotopic measurements and lipid biomarker                           distributions alone.  New insight will be gained into the                       behavior of particulate organic matter in two markedly                          different oceanic regimes:  an oxygenated oligotrophic water                    column (the Sargasso Sea) and a marine anoxic basin (the Black                  Sea).  These two sites are chosen because sample suites for                     lipid biomarker and isotopic analyses are presently on hand.                    Particles from these two locations will also have very                          different lipid distributions and should likewise have                          different isotopic compositions.  Thus, this study will not                     only be determining the biomarker/isotope signatures of                         particles in a depth profile from some location in the ocean                    but will also be comparing organism matter processing in the                    very different environments.",
