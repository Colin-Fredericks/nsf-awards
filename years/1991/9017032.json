 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research             project in polymer chemistry between B. Milosavljevic of the Boris              Kidrich Institute for Nuclear Science and J. Kerry Thomas of the                University of Notre Dame is to investigate the effects of high                  energy radiation on polymer materials.  The researchers propose to              develop a theory on the nature of the products formed by high energy            radiation.  The high energy radiation work will be carried out at               the Boris Kidrich Institute and polymer characterization will be                handled by the University of Notre Dame on their pulsed laser                   facility.   The results of this research on the use of radiation to             create miniature circuits on polymer materials will have an                     important impact in the microelectronics area.                                                                                                                  This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The award,                except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav             institution.",
