 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Phokion Kolaitis, University of                   California, Santa Cruz, to collaborate in applied mathematics with              Professor Jouko Vaananen, Department of Mathematics, University of              Helsinki, Finland.  They propose to undertake a systematic                      investigation of finite model theory from the perspective of                    abstract model theory.  The combination of their complementary                  expertise in  these areas should produce significant conceptual and             theoretical contributions to finite model theory..                                                                                                              Finite model theory is the study of first-order logic and its                   extensions on finite structures.  It is an area of research within              logic in computer science that has had numerous interactions with               mathematical logic, database theory, and computational complexity.              Logicians have developed such a theory of extended logics on                    arbitrary structures, known as abstract model theory.  So far no                general theory of extended logics on finite structures exists.                  The proposed collaborative research will expand the current                     framework of this important area of logic.",
