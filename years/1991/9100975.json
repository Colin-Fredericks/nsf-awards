This                 study investigates habitat-specific factors that potentially                    affect the demographic patterns of recruitment, early growth, and               survivorship of two species of opportunistic corals, Pocillopora                verrucosa and P. eydouxi, that are recolonizing a disturbed coral               reef environment.  The importance of competition with filamentous               and fleshy algae and protection from grazers on the distribution                and survivorship of coral spat and young corals will be assessed                with field surveys and manipulative experiments.  Habitat-                      specific demographic parameters will be determined for three                    patch types (areas of high cover of filamentous algae, areas with               high density of fleshy algae, and areas of heavy grazing and high               cover of crustose algae) in both back-reef and fore-reef                        habitats.                                                                            Coral reefs are extremely important habitats in the world's                oceans.  This is the first study of recolonization of a disturbed               reef to emphasize the role of the mosaic nature of the landscape                on establishment and growth of young corals.  Algal cover is an                 important variable on disturbed or degraded reefs that may affect               recovery of the hard coral community.  Understanding this                       interaction and the underlying processes in community recovery is               essential for management and conservation of coral reef systems.",
