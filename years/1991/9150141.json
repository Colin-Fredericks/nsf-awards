 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1988 and 1989, ASTC offered a seven-day institute                       for founders of new science centers, funded by the National                     Science Foundation.  The impact of these institutes was                         profound, making the difference between success and failure                     for several, and helping many others clarify and strengthen                     their plans.  Since then demand for technical assistance to                     new science centers has increased rather than decreased.                        Building on its experience, ASTC proposes a 3-1/2 year                          multiple-strategy program to provide knowledgeable,                             supportive guidance to the founders of new science centers.                     The elements are:                                                                                                                                                         (1)  a 4-day workshop on how to start a science                                      center;                                                                    (2)  a resource book on starting and operating                                       science centers;                                                           (3)  a network for new science centers which meets                                   at the ASTC annual conference for mutual                                        support and information sharing;                                           (4)  one-day workshops held in Conjunction with                                      the ASTC conference and planned by the                                          steering committee of the New Science Center                                    Network;                                                                   (5)  increased coverage in the ASTC Newsletter;                                 (6)  an annual progress report on new science                                        centers; and                                                               (7)  on-going, individualized technical                                              assistance.",
