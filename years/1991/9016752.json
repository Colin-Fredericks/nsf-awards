 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two year cooperative research                         project between Professor Charles M Falco, Department of                        Physics, University of Arizona and Professor Teruya Shinjo,                     Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, Japan.                       The project will involve the experimental study of several                      interesting physical properties of artificial multilayers                       consisting of metallic elements. Artificial multilayers are                     new materials which do not exist in nature.  As such there                      are a number of unusual, and potentially useful, physical                       phenomena exhibited by these materials including, for                           example, magnetic excitations, perpendicular magnetic                           anisotropy, dimensionality crossover effects, and unusual                       magneto-optic properties.  The particular physical properties                   to be studied include perpendicular magnetization in ultrathin                  magnetic layers, giant magnetoresistance of ferromagnetic                       multilayers, and lattice dynamics and elastic properties of                     epitaxial multilayers.  A variety of techniques available in                    Arizona and Kyoto will be used to characterize these materials                  including x-ray diffraction, Brillouin light scattering,                        superconducting measurements and a variety of surface science                   probes. The materials themselves will be prepared by                            alternately depositing two elements using vacuum deposition                     and sputtering techniques.                                                                                                                                      The expertise of the US and Japanese scientists is complemen-                   tary.  Professor Falco is an expert in the structural and                       electronic properties of thin films and superlattices, while                    Professor Shinjo is an expert on the magnetic properties,                       particularly the Mossbauer spectroscopy, of these systems.                      The study of artificially prepared multilayers is considered                    to be among the frontier topics in solid state physics                          research and the results of this collaboration will be of                       great scientific interest.  It is expected that the collabor-                   ation will generate new data that will improve our under-                       standing of the magnetic properties of metallic superlattices                   which may lead to new systems for magnetic storage applicat-                    tions.",
