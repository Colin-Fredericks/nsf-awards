 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is an investigation of the fundamentals of heat and                                                                                                  mass transfer occurring during the steam cleaning of                            contaminants adsorbed in soil.  The heat transfer and the                       condensate and gas flow are analyzed assuming local thermal                     equilibrium, convection, dispersion, gravity, capillarity and                   diffuso- and thermo-capillarity.  The mass transfer among the                   phases (solid, liquid, and gas) are analyzed based on local                     non-equilibrium assumptions.  The interfacial mass transfer                     coefficients and the specific surface areas are obtained by a                   direct simulation of two-phase flow in a phenomenological                       unit-cell.                                                                                                                                                      Experiments are performed in soil columns using contaminant                     simulants with a controlled initial equilibrium (solid-gas)                     condition prior to injection of steam.  Transient local                         temperature, capillary pressure, and contaminant concentration                                                                                                  (in liquid and gaseous phases) measurements are made.  The                      results of the experiments will be compared to those predicted                                                                                                  in order to examine the validity of the phenomenological unit-                                                                                                  cell based kinetic model.                                                                                                                                       The proposed research will allow for the development and                        critical verification of the pore-level analysis of heat and                    mass transfer in soil during steam cleaning.  For the first                     time, the local velocity and local saturation dependence of                     the mass transfer rates among the three phases will be                          determined by a direct simulation and will be verified                          experimentally.   The results will also be valuable for                         analysis/prediction of the isothermal remediation processes.",
