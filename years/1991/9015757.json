 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research focuses on developing queueing theories of                      multi-media traffic integration in high speed networks.                         Multi-media traffic has great diversity of traffic characteristics              and service requirements.  Because of the lack of analytical tools              for the evaluation of multi-media traffic queues, most analytical               issues of network control and service management are basically                  untouched. This research addresses these issues and includes:                     o  characterizing the diversity of multi-media traffic                          o  formulating a multi-dimensional discrete Markov queueing                        process                                                                      o  developing analytical solution techniques                                    o  analyzing and decoupling the interconnected multi-media queues             The research also involves finding simple effective tools for                   analysis of network resource allocation and call management issues.             The researcher will first concentrate on developing a simple closed             form solution for the approximate average delay of multi-media                  traffic queues.  The tail distribution of the queues will also be               characterized in a simple geometric form, to capture  the packet                loss behavior of finite buffer systems.  Finally the researcher                 will study the feasibility of decomposing the analysis of                       interconnected multi-media traffic queues.",
