 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research project jointly funded by the Electric                       Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the National Science                        Foundation (NSF).  Since the 1960's, polyethylene-insulated                     cable rated for 15 to 35 KV service has been used extensively                   to provide underground service to residences.  Polyethylene is                  inexpensive, is easily spliced and terminated and has very                      good dielectric properties.  Such polyethylene-insulated                        cables often fail before the expected 40 year lifetime.                         Examination of insulation from failed underground cables                        frequently reveals the presence of diffuse bush- or fan-like                    structures which develop only in the presence of water.  These                  structures, know as \"water trees\", are usually in the 0.1 to                    1.0 mm size range, consist of a collection of voids and                         originate at the interface between the insulation and another                   material.  Plasma polymerization refers to the formation of                     polymeric materials from the plasma state of a gas or monomer                   at low pressure (vacuum).  The resulting materials are                          significantly different from most conventional polymers.                        Plasma polymerization is system dependent and a variety of                      polymeric materials including diamond, graphite, carbonaceous                   films, to polystyrene-like films can be prepared using plasma                   polymerization of styrene.  The key factor which determines                     the properties of the material which results is the design of                   the plasma polymerization reactor.                                                                                                                              This research project is a fundamental investigation of the                     potential use of plasma polymerized films (plasma polymers)                     for the optimization of metal-polymer interfaces which are                      relevant to application in electric power cables.  The study                    is focussed on three major objectives: (1) improvement of the                   moisture barrier characteristics of jackets and primary                         insulators, (2) improved corrosion protection of the center                     conductor and neutral, and (3) development of a                                 triboelectrically graded interface to minimize breakdown due                    to charge injection.  The work involves studies of the basic                    phenomena associated with the metal-polymer interface, such as                  adhesion, and water and/or electrical-treeing.",
