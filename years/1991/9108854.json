Nonwovens are a class of fabrics which are bonded fiber webs and                                                                                                which are not woven, knitted or paper structures.  This new                     industry has spawned new consumer, health care and industrial                   products.  The value of nonwoven goods exceeds $2.4 B annually.                                                                                                 The base for this Center is an existing Industrial Consortium for                                                                                               Nonwovens Research.  This Center will serve the nonwovens industry                                                                                              in the State of North Carolina (about 100 small, medium, and large                                                                                              companies) and the U.S. through its programs of generic fundamental                                                                                             and applied research in the technologies of the industry, as well                                                                                               as through an active program of technology transfer.  The Center                                                                                                will be supported by funds from NSF, the State of North Carolina,                                                                                               and from the dues paid by member companies.                                          The Center will be housed in the College of Textiles.  Its                 faculty will be drawn, primarily, from the departments of the                   College, although members from other departments of the university                                                                                              (e.g., wood and paper science, mechanical engineering, computer                 science, etc.) will also play a role as the Center grows in its                 activities.  The structure of the Center includes an Industrial                 Advisory Board and special activities to promote technology                     transfer to this industry.
