 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous NSF-funded research has successfully developed                         intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) applying ideas from artificial               intelligence (AI). This work has also uncovered important                       limitations of intelligent tutoring systems. ITS are generally                  limited to teaching relatively well-defined, algorithmic skills                 that they can be programmed to fully understand. This excludes                  many interesting areas of mathematics for which expert systems                  cannot yet be built. In addition, ITS are generally limited to                  teaching through didactic instruction. This excludes learning by                construction, or through inquiry - an alternate model of learning               that is poorly understood, yet increasingly regarded as                         important.                                                                                                                                                      The goal is to develop and evaluate computer-based environments                 that support the learning of mathematical skills which are not                  highly algorithmical and that support learning by methods other                 than instruction. The AI approach will be applied in new ways.                  The main research questions are: Can intelligent AI-based                       software tools be developed that support learning by inquiry? And               can inquiry skills themselves - for example problem posing and                  productive guess-and-test technique - be learned by students in a               supportive environment? In the past, inquiry strategies have not                been demonstrated to be teachable, nor has inquiry been shown to                be a cost-effective way to learn mathematical concepts. However,                it is conjectured that in developing instructionist tools, ITS                  have provided a foundation for designing similar tools to support               inquiry. New tools will be built to help computer environments                  guide students' explorations, productively manage \"thrashing\",                  and organize students' conjectures and explanations.                            \"Microworlds\" will be constructed for various mathematical                      content areas, and evaluate software products.",
