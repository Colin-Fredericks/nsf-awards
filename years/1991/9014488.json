 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Gellman                     will evaluate the contribution made by hydrogen bonds that                      involve amide groups toward determining the overall                             conformational stability of globular proteins. The project                      utilizes small, flexible molecules that contain a limited                       number of amide groups to dissect the contribution of this one                  particular class of non-covalent interaction. Results obtained                  from this work are expected to afford increased understanding                   of the factors that determine three-dimensional protein                         structure and, accordingly, that direct the biological function                 (enzymatic, regulatory or structural) of a globular protein.                                                                                                    Conformational preferences in the various model systems will be                 studied spectroscopically under conditions in which internal                    hydrogen bonds are energetically significant. Conformational                    preferences observed in a series of closely related oligoamides                 should provide information about the manner in which hydrogen                   bond strength is affected by the spatial orientation of the                     bonding partners. This analysis also should reveal the manner                   in which hydrogen bonds are affected by other internal                          non-covalent interactions, and also how they are affected by                    the environment (e.g., solvent).",
