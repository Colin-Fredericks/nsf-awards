 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal studies the problem arising when countries disagree               over their beliefs about how fast global warming is occurring.  The             objective is to understand how this divergence of beliefs affects               the kinds of international agreements that are likely to be adopted             and to explore formats or mechanisms that might lead to better                  international solutions even if no consensus on probabilities                   exists.  The study also aims to pinpoint the kinds of agreements                that might be possible given the current range of beliefs and                   mitigation costs.  The major part of the project is a decision                  theory model of international environmental policies when                       probability beliefs differ.  We study this in the context of a                  particular set of international environmental policies that are                 likely to be considered.  The second part of the project is a                   beginning empirical analysis of the distribution of beliefs and                 mitigation costs across countries.  Most of these estimates should              be available from other sources, and this project hopes to uncover              some straightforward empirical relationships among countries'                   environmental policies with respect to global warming.",
