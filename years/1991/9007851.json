 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in science is shifting from its traditional focus on the               discovery of new information toward the computationally intensive task          of processing it.  This proposal aims at developing new algorithmic             techniques to support the large-scale computing requirements of high-           performance applications.  This project will focus on incremental,              parallel, and input/output (I/O) algorithms.                                    For each of these three computational models, several problems will             be studied, with particular emphasis on data structures, graphs, and            computational geometry.  These problems include such key                        high-performance applications as sorting, FFT, matrix operations,               neural nets, caching, VLSI layout, robotics, network optimization,              computer-aided design, and graphics display.  All three computational           models are motivated by the extreme demands placed by  large-scale              applications, and thus it makes sense to consider hybrid                        computational models in order to get even better performance.                   Examples include solving dynamic problems in parallel and analyzing             the I/O efficiency of parallel and incremental algorithms.  Finally, a          new framework for incremental complexity and its relation to                    sequential and parallel complexity will be studied.",
