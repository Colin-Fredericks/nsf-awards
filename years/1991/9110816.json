 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at obtaining a better understanding of how to            design expert systems for real-time applications.  A metric for a               real-time expert system is defined as the probability that the system           successfully formulates and executes strategies under real-time                 constraints.  The objectives of the proposed research are to propose a          formal theory for quantifying the estimation of this metric and to              investigate the validity of the theory by applying it to develop a              real-time expert system embedded within a control system with varying           degrees of timing requirements.  It is expected that the proposed               theory can serve as a basis for designing and verifying the                     functional and timing requirements of future real-time expert systems.",
