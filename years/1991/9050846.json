 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is requested for improvements to the Environmental                      simulation Laboratory.  Established with a major NSF grant in                   1972, the laboratory setting.  Students can simulate the visual                 quality of full scale real world physical environments using                    small scale three dimensional models.  A computer-aided periscope               lens and video camera records at eye level in motion what a                     person would see walking or driving in proximity to a proposed                  design.                                                                                                                                                         Recent advances in computer simulation techniques make it                       possible to update and improve the laboratory equipment.  These                 advances, including new color display technology, digital memory                and microprocessor quality images a reality even on desktop                     computers.                                                                                                                                                      Three of our personal computer workstations are equipped with                   raster graphics adapter cards capable of converting images to                   digital format.  Using application software, these images are                   then manipulated and combined with other images.  For example, a                view of the real side can be combined with a view of a scale                    model to explain the visual effects of a proposed design on the                 environment.  For the  simulation of movement, one of the three                 workstations is equipped with an animation module and application               software to render sequential views of a computer generated                     model.",
