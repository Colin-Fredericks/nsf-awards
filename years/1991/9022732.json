 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to understand the economic factors                 producing different policy outcomes in open economies, and to                   evaluate in a quantitative fashion the implications for global                  welfare of the increasing integration of world financial markets.               To further the first component of this plan, the project studies                game-theoretic models of discretionary policymaking, assuming that              the private sector has rational expectations.  Central issues                   include the possibility of default on public debt and the role of               currency devaluation in financial crises.  The second component of              the work calculates measures of the gains to countries from the                 ability to pool country-specific risks internationally, and to                  borrow and lend.  Linkages between international capital mobility               and long-run economic growth rates will also be studied.                                                                                                        This project has the potential to explain certain empirical                     features of international capital markets.  In addition, the                    findings are relevant for judging the likely benefits of measure                to integrate capital markets further - such as the current                      initiatives within the European Community - or the costs of                     measures to restrict capital movements, which sometimes are                     proposed on macroeconomic grounds.",
