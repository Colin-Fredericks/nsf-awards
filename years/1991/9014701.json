Chief                                 among these devices are photoreceivers which                                    combine a photodetection element, such as a                                     photodiode or photoconductor, with a preamplifier.                              Success with such \"building-block\" circuits is                                  essential if more sophisticated, more highly                                    functional monolithic integrated optoelectronic                                 circuits are to be realized.  In this award a program                           will be aimed at systematically addressing several of                           the most fundamental issues involved in fabricating                             high-performance, monolithic photoreceivers and                                 receiver arrays based on InP and related materials.                             High bandwidth, highly functional monolithic                                    photoreceivers will be designed, fabricated, and                                tested for use in both high density and wide                                    bandwidth system architectures.  Several transistor                             and circuit configurations will be optimized for                                these applications using both a theoretical and                                 empirical approach.  The completed monolithic                                   receivers will be utilized in optical system                                    experiments.  This project is a renewal of a                                    previous three year NSF funded program, and                                     significantly extends prior results toward the                                  understanding of the limits of receiver performance.",
