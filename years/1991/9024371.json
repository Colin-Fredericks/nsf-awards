Problem IV:  Which processes are responsible for the transport                  and regeneration of particulate and dissolved nutrients?                                                                                                        The work is designed to fill that gap in knowledge by making                    high resolution profiles of small particles using                               transmissometers and of aggregates using Large Aggregate                        Profiling Systems (LAPS).  LAPS profiling is proposed during                    the two transect cruises and the two times-series in EQPAC to                   contribute to the solution of the above problems.  LAPS also                    has a transmissometer and CTD to obtain simultaneous profiles                   of beam attenuation (proportional to small particle                             concentration), temperature and salinity to compare particle                    distributions with water structure.",
