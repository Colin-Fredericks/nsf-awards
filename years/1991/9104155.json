 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is focused on a new computational                    method developed for solving variational problems with a large,                 possibly infinite, set of constraints.  An investigation of                     various aspects of this method is proposed, with emphasis on the                error analysis, discretization techniques, generalizations and                  convergence acceleration.  On the basis of this method                          computational algorithms are expected to be developed for a class               of equilibrium and slow evolution problems and for evolution                    problems with a large number of conservation laws.  A large class               of applications in physics and engineering is proposed for the                  investigation with the help of these computational                              algorithms. Applied problems include problems in ideal                          magnetohydrodynamics (tokamak design, analysis of the                           experimental data), fluid dynamics (design of efficient                         computational algorithms with improved convergence and stability                properties) and astrophysics.                                                        The variational approach is also proposed for developing                   numerical methods for finding periodic solutions of nonlinear                   wave equation and quasi-periodic solutions of second order                      dynamical systems.",
