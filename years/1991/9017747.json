 "awd_abstract_narration": "The history of life is recorded in the fossil record.  Because             significant episodes of global-level environmental change have                  recurred in the earth's history, it is feasible to predict the                  effect of current levels of change on the earth's biota, by                     studying the fossil record before and after those important                     episodes.  Three types of information are necessary to interpret                this record effectively:  (1) a sound systematic framework (that                is, a consistent and biologically meaningful set of names and                   categories that are based on phylogenetic relationships) for                    discussing the fossils; (2) reliable stratigraphic placement (that              is, a framework for ordering fossil occurrences in space and time);             and (3) an independent record of environmental change that allows               placement of the biological record in the context of a dynamic                  planet (lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere).                   Although such data are routinely available for fossils deposited                during the past 540 million years, there is at present no                       comparable framework for interpreting older fossils, which                      constitute about 90% of life's history.  In this project, the PI                proposes to provide detailed systematic, stratigraphic, and                     environmental data for the fossils of organisms that lived 900-540              million years before the present.  This will almost double the                  period for which the life history of the planet can be studied in               detail.  More importantly, it is clear that the interval under                  consideration was a time of profound environmental change that had              a major influence on the subsequent course of evolution and, hence,             the diversity of life.  The derived data will help refine our                   understanding of a critical period in the Earth's environmental                 and biological development.  The research is also of practical                  value in that the establishment of a reliable stratigraphic and                 environmental framework will facilitate resource exploration in                 rocks containing under exploited petroleum and ore deposits.",
