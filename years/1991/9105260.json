 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arabidopsis thaliana floral homeotic gene, AGAMOUS (AG), and                six additional genes, AGL1-AGL6, have been isolated. Their                      sequences share striking similarity with the DNA binding domain                 of transcription factors from humans (SRF) and yeast (MCM1),                    which regulate the expression of the human proto-oncogene c-fos                 and yeast mating type specific genes, respectively. AG and five                 of the AGLs are expressed preferentially in flowers, while AGL3                 is expressed both in flowers and in vegetative tissues. Dr. Ma                  proposes to dissect the functional domains of AG using mutational               analysis, promoter fusions, and domain switching. Furthermore, he               proposes to characterize the structure and expression of the AGL3               gene, which has a unique expression pattern among these seven                   genes, and may play a more fundamental role in both reproductive                and vegetative tissues. Finally, because the yeast MCM1 gene has                the same type of DNA binding domain, and because powerful genetic               and molecular tools are available in yeast, he proposes to study                some functional aspects of the AG protein in yeast. The                         combination of these methods in both plant and yeast will lead to               a better understanding of the function of these plant genes.",
