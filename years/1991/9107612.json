 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator undertakes the analysis and                     implementation of numerical methods for the computation of                      invariant manifolds of dynamical systems and of invariant curves                of maps.  A feature of this work is to implement certain                        coordinate changes that will greatly extend the applicability of                the algorithms.  In most applications, the dynamical systems                    depend on one or more parameters; then the determination of                     suitable coordinates will be combined with the idea of path                     following.  As long as the manifolds deform smoothly when system                parameters change, the proposed methods will permit following the               manifolds computationally.  A longer-term goal is to study                      bifurcations of invariant manifolds numerically, in particular                  the breakdown of tori.  It is expected that the region of                       breakdown will be characterized numerically by several turning                  points of the discrete solution branch, and that the number of                  turning points increases as the meshsize is refined.  The                       proposed research will point the way towards the development of                 efficient algorithms for the computations of invariant manifolds,               and will provide a valuable tool for the study of dynamical                     systems.                                                                             Nonlinear dynamical systems play an important role in many                 areas of the applied sciences and of engineering and technology.                For example, they are used to model flows around airplanes and                  submarines, vibrations of engines, currents in electrical                       networks, and blood flow in the heart.  All these systems                       depend on parameters, which can partially be controlled or                      monitored.  A practical problem of main importance is to predict                the critical values of parameters, for which qualitative changes                of the dynamical systems occur.  These changes are called                       bifurcations.  For example, a long-outstanding problem is                       to predict the transition from laminar to turbulent flow.                       Similarly, a vibrating structure can bifurcate from quasiperiodic               to chaotic motion; the latter is unpredictable and might lead to                the breakdown of the structure.  The behavior of a dynamical                    system is often characterized by its properties on an                           invariant manifold.  This project will develop numerical software               to compute invariant manifolds and to follow them computationally               as system parameters change. Important cases are given by                       invariant tori, which correspond to quasiperiodic (predictable)                 motion;  breakdown of the tori corresponds to the transition                    to chaotic (unpredictable) motion.  With algorithms developed in                this work, one will be able to compute values for bifurcation                   parameters, i.e., one can predict parameter values for which                    major qualitative changes of the dynamical system will occur.                   The algorithms will be tested on systems of coupled                             oscillators and vibrating mechanical structures, but they will                  apply to other areas of the applied sciences where dynamical                    systems are used for modelling.",
