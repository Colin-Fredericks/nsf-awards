 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ohio State University is offering a two-week intensive workshop             for undergraduate mathematics faculty, concentrating on the use of              new technology in mathematics instruction.  The workshop addresses              the use of graphing calculators and software in precalculus                     instruction, the use of symbolic computer algebra systems in                    calculus instruction, and the use of numerical linear algebra                   software in basic matrix theory courses.  The workshop introduces               the tools to participants, provides opportunities for extensive                 hands-on experience in a laboratory setting, and encourages each                participant to develop an extensive project which blends                        technological tools with relevant mathematics and curriculum                    development issues.  The workshop is being offered twice during the             summer of 1991 and twice during the summer of 1992 to 25                        participants each session (50 each summer).  Follow-up meetings                 will be held at the O.S.U. Technology Conferences scheduled for                 November 1991 and November 1992, as well as brief weekend meetings              in spring 1991 and 1992.  An extensive effort is being made to                  recruit participants from underrepresented groups and participants              from colleges whose student population includes a large proportion              of members of underrepresented groups.//",
