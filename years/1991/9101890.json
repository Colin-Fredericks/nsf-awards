 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow continuation of a scientific collabo-                     ration between the Biochemistry Departments of the University                   of Maryland at Baltimore and the Federal University of Rio de                   Janeiro.  The investigators are Guiseppi Inesi (U.S.) and                       Leopoldo deMeis (Brazil).  The research is aimed at a                           clarification of the mechanism of ATP dependent calcium                         transport across biological membranes.  The experimental                        system will consist of membrane vesicles derived from                           sarcoplasmic reticulum, and obtained by homogenization and                      differential centrifugation of muscle tissue.  CA2+ -ATPase                     expressed in transfected cell cultures will be also used.                       The chemical derivatization experiments will be complemented                    by expression of mutated cDNA in cell cultures.  Microsomes                     prepared from transfected cells display a very active                           transport activity, and constitute a highly favorable system                    for studies of specific mutations.                                                                                                                              The collaborators have a long standing record of productive                     collaboration.  The biological significance of this research                    is related to control of contractile activation and relaxation                  in muscle fibers.  Its chemical significance is related to                      enzyme kinetics and catalysis, coupling of catalytic and                        transport activities, channels and transmembrane fluxes of                      electrolytes, and structure of proteins.",
