 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                   anthropologist in highland Bolivia.  The research will examine                  Andean land-use focusing on the field fallowing choices of                      households and local resource management institutions.  The study               examines sectoral fallowing systems, which balance community                    control over agricultural decisions with individual farmer's                    decisions.  The project will examine the soil on a sample of                    farms to relate decisions about fallow strategies to soil                       quality.  Methods include participant observation, a sample                     survey of 130 farm families, and soil samples and analysis from                 the interviewed farms and a sample of 30 fields in different                    agro-ecological zones.                                                                                                                                          This research is important because this area of the world has                   well-defined traditional community resource management                          institutions.  Understanding how specific institutions succeed or               fail in managing fundamental resources like soil is important to                help design conservation policies for other areas.",
