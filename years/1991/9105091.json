 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to characterize the mechanism of                     retroviral integration.  Retroviruses efficiently and stably                    introduce foreign genes into the host genome.  Defining the pathway             and requirements for integration is significant both for the                    understanding of the viral life-cycle, but also as a means of                   introduction of DNA, in general, into mammalian cells.  Two known               viral components are needed for an integration event:  the IN                   protein and the inverted repeat sequences found at the termini of               the Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs).  Experiments are aimed at                     defining the functional domains of the Moloney-Murine Leukemia                  Virus (M-MuLV) IN protein.  A second objective is to define the                 specific sequences recognized by the IN protein and possibly other              proteins with the LTR terminal inverted repeats.  A third objective             is to see if the virus could be directed to integrate into a known              site in the host DNA.                                                                                                                                           The information resulting from this work will give greater insight              into the molecular mechanisms utilized by viruses.  Such insights               will obviously affect the practical concerns in using viruses as                vectors.***",
