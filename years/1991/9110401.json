 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental question in neurobiology is how the brain forms and               maintains memories.  One possibility is that neurochemical                      changes are involved.  To test this idea, Dr. Dluzen has designed               a clever series of studies that uses in vivo push-pull cannula                  system combined with state-of-the-art methods of detecting and                  identifying relevant neurochemicals.  He will measure specific                  neurotransmitters or their metabolites within discretely                        localized brain regions in freely behaving animals.  The animals                will perform a series of novel behavioral tasks that allow                      evaluation of the behavioral responses within the context of                    memory/recognition processes.  Moreover, Dr. Dluzen will examine                how hormones and previous social experiences modulate the                       behaviors and neurotransmitters.  Thus, his work will lead to a                 better understanding of how neurochemical responses within                      specific brain regions are involved in the formation and                        maintenance of memories and recognition processes and how                       hormones and experience alter these memories.",
