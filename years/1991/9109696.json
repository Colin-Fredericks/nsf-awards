 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic reform in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union has                      attracted great attention in the past year.  Reforming governments              have sought advice about how to lay the foundations for the                     operation of capitalist market economies.  A necessary precondition             for the proper functioning of capital markets is implementation of              clear and enforceable definitions of property rights, of which                  bankruptcy laws are an important component.  It is precisely these              rights and laws that are currently lacking in Eastern Europe.                   Although previous researchers have produced legal or historical                 comparative studies of bankruptcy laws or financial institutions,               no modern analysis or theory exists for the transition from                     socialism to capitalism.                                                                                                                                        This research examines the problems of design and implementation                of bankruptcy laws and the link between bankruptcy statutes and                 capital markets during the transition from centrally planning and               largely state-owned economies to market-oriented economies with                 private ownership.  The study is comparative, not only among the                several East European states themselves, but also regarding                     capitalist economies with longstanding bankruptcy systems.  The                 research methodology employs a combination of formal, mathematical              modeling, economic analysis of legal and financial developments,                and gathering of data regarding design and enforcement of                       bankruptcy laws in these two sets of economies.                                                                                                                 This research should enhance our understanding of the role and                  functions of law and of economic behavior under conditions of rapid             social transformation.  It will contribute to the development of                aspects of the theory of financial reform necessary for the move                from nonmarket to market economic systems.  Also, it is likely to               advance knowledge about the economics of law and the optimal                    strategies and policy options for legislative reform regarding key              economic laws such as bankruptcy.",
