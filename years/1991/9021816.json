 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Rocky               Mountain Biological Laboratory, an independent nonprofit field                  station, for replacement of Barclay Teaching Laboratory which                   houses experimentally-oriented, high-altitude field biological                  research and research training activities.  This building was                   constructed in 1967 and has never been previously renovated.  Its               replacement is fully justified and cost-effective.  The ARFMP                   grant of $100,000 and $115,137 provided by the grantee as cost                  sharing will be used to modernize these research and research                   training facilities which will enhance the laboratory component of              field projects carried out at Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory              and remove some of the seasonal constraints on the conduct of                   research.  This project will address the need to improve the                    current research infrastructure by utilizing the foundation of the              original building for the construction of another building of                   better design.                                                                                                                                                  This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality students and faculty.  The large                    number of students from many institutions who are currently                     trained in field biology by outstanding biologists at Rocky                     Mountain Biological Laboratory, in spite of the adverse conditions              that prevail, is exemplary.  The proposed improvements will ensure              that continued growth in the already successful faculty research                program will proceed and that additional emphasis will be placed on             student research and research training.",
