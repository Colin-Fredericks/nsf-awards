 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Point               Reyes Bird Observatory for the renovation and repair of the                     Palomarin Field Research Station which houses the Program of                    Terrestrial and Theoretical Ecology's research and research                     training activities on terrestrial birds and their habitats in                  the areas of population dynamics, evolutionary ecology, and                     behavioral and physiological ecology of resident and migrant                    species.  This building was constructed in 1950 and has not been                renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $151,000 and                     $151,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to                modernize these research and research training facilities.  This                project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure by correcting deficiencies in the current                        facility's foundation, roof, furnace, septic system, and                        plumbing; by upgrading the electrical system and weather                        equipment; reducing the danger of fire, water damage, and rodent                damage to the buildings; and by installing an advanced research                 laboratory.  In this laboratory, it will be possible to obtain                  and process blood samples as well as to analyze avian behavior                  and energy budgets.                                                                                                                                             This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of the Point                  Reyes Bird Observatory's internationally-recognized, productive,                long-term interdisciplinary research studies and for the training               of graduate students from universities all over the nation with                 needs to collaborate in terrestrial and theoretical ecology.                    Student interns trained in these laboratories have an excellent                 record of professional placement nationally and internationally,                and, as a result of this project, they will have access to more                 sophisticated field and laboratory techniques than are currently                available.  Students trained in these laboratories are in demand                in both basic and applied fields.  The importance of the applied                research conducted at Point Reyes will increase as more national                and international attention is paid to the ecological                           consequences of global warming, the biological diversity crisis,                and the impact of the destruction of tropical and subtropical                   forests on northern hemisphere migrants.",
