 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  four-year project will develop a program for                              kindergarten through sixth grades that fosters the                              development of number sense concepts through a problem-                         solving approach.l  The program will provide conceptual                         edperiences to promote students' understanding of number,                       quantity, and operations.  It will model new teaching                           strategies and content for elementary mathematic                                instruction.                                                                                                                                                    The projecat will develo;p, pilot, and evaluate three units                     per grade level.  Each unit will be two tothree weeks long                      and have a dual focus:  to deepen students' understanding of                    mathematical concepts and to develop their interpersonal                        skills and commitment to values of caring, fairness, and                        responsibility.  The units will provide opportunities for                       students to explore number concepts as they cooperatively                       investigate problems and communicate about their thinking                       and learning.  The units will be devel;oped through a                           process that includes repeated trials in classrooms by                          teachers and CMP staff.  The units will be published by                         Addison-Wesley.                                                                                                                                                 An evaluation will assess:  (1) how teachers use the                            materials in their classrooms; (2) how participation in a                       staff development program influences teacher implementation;                    and (3) the impact of the program on student concept                            attainment and teachers' and students' attitudes about                          mathematics.",
