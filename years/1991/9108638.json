 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a Planning Grant in the Research Opportunities                 for Women program.  The primary goal of this research is to                     develop a pattern recognition system for detection of desired                   groups of linear/curvilinear features in remote-sensing imagery.                The experimental portion of the proposed preliminary research                   will focus on the detection of lineaments (noncultural linear or                curvilinear features in imagery) which represent zones of                       structural weakness using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data sets                of the Canadian Shield.  The desired set of linear features must                be distinguished from cultural and other non-cultural linear                    features.  For the proposed preliminary research, a neural                      network approach will be investigated.  Neural networks can                     conceivably be used for feature extraction, for classification,                 and for grouping extracted linear elements.                                        The proposed research planning activities are: (1) a                         comprehensive literature review, (2) development of image                       representation schemes, (3) construction of training sets for                   neural networks, and (4) design and preliminary assessment of                   neural networks for feature extraction, for recognition of                      desired pattern elements, and for grouping pattern elements into                desired linear/curvilinear features.  In parallel with the                      literature review, image representation schemes will be developed               to encode information for neural networks.  Candidate                           representation schemes for neural network classifiers include                   pixel representations (feature vectors associated with each                     pixel), edge/line representations (obtained as a result of neural               network feature extraction (such as boundary contour system                     representations).  Training sets will be constructed and                        preliminary experiments conducted using, as appropriate, computer               resources awarded by the Cornell National Supercomputer Facility                (CNSF).",
