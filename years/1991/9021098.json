 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Alan Kolata, a professor of                          Anthropology at the University of Chicago, Mr. John Janusek will                collect and analyze data for his doctoral dissertation.                         Continuing on his previous work, he will conduct archaeological                 excavation in the Tiwanaku region in the highlands of Bolivia. He               will focus on domestic areas which served as foci not only for                  habitation but also production and excavate at both the core site               of Tiwanaku itself as well as the nearby regional center of                     Lukurmata. His goal is to compare the two and thereby gain                      insight into the Tiwanakian social, political and economic                      organization. Through the analysis of artifactual, faunal and                   floral remains he will attempt to determine: 1. the extent to                   which occupational specialization is present at either site; 2.                 the role the state played in the redistribution of materials; 3.                whether status differential is evident between sites; and 4. the                local variability in lifestyle and status among residential units               in each site.                                                                                                                                                   Tiwanaku marks one of the pinnacles in the development of pre-                  Columbian social achievements. In a relatively inhospitable high                Andean environment, an empire was established which incorporated                large portions of present day Bolivia and Peru. At Tiwanaku                     itself elaborate monuments were constructed and the population is               estimated at between 60,000 - 80,000 individuals. It is unclear                 however how, in the absence of a system of writing and such                     elements as wheeled vehicles, such an empire developed and was                  maintained. The goal of Mr. Janusek's work is to shed light on                  the social, economic and political factors responsible.                                                                                                         This research is important for several reasons. First, it will                  increase our understanding of how complex societies emerge. It                  will also provide data on an extremely important and little known               site and this will be of interest to a wide archaeological                      audience. Finally it will assist in the training of an extremely                promising scientist.",
