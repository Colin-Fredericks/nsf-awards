 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns theoretical and practical aspects of the             Homeomorphism Problem for 3-manifolds (to algorithmically recognize             the topological type of a given 3-manifold).  In its full                       generality, the solvability of this problem is still an open                    question, but for a large class of 3-manifolds, the corresponding               problem has been solved.  Typically, those algorithms which                     completely solve a Recognition Problem are slow (i.e., of                       exponential time-demand), while the fast (polynomial-time)                      algorithms give only partial results.  Recently, the investigator               found a complete algorithm for recognizing the \"unknot\" which is                also fast; however, the proof that the worst-case time-demand is,               indeed, polynomially bounded, is not yet complete.  The                         investigator intends to complete the work on the fast recognition               of the unknot, and to extend the result to some related recognition             problems.  He also intends to simplify the older theory by means of             recently discovered results.",
