 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial funding of a workshop in professional               communications skills to be held just prior to the national meeting             of the American Society for Microbiology, 5 May, 1991.  This                    workshop will provide basic training in effective communications                skills appropriate for academic science faculty.  These exercises               in which the attendees will participate are based on the strategies             of neurolinguistic programming (NLP) developed at the University of             California by John Grinder and others.  NLP training has been                   widely used in professional and organizational development since                the late 1970's.  The workshop is especially appropriate for                    academic scientists who have little opportunity (compared to their              colleagues in the business world) for training in the \"people                   skills\" so important for mentoring, running a research team,                    negotiating the steps to promotion and tenure, etc.  Since                      effective communication and the ability to manage/motivate others               are fundamental prerequisites for professional advancement in every             field, this workshop is especially appropriate for women and                    minority scientists.",
