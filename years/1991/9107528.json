 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobilization of the tom transposable element in Drosophila                      ananassae results in high incidence of spontaneous mutations.                   Most of these mutations show dominant eye-specific phenotypes,                  suggesting a high selectivity in the type of genes that can be                  mutated by the tom element, or alternatively, a specificity in                  the mechanism by which this transposable element causes mutant                  phenotypes. Preliminary results suggest that tom-induced dominant               phenotypes result from over-expression of genes located adjacent                to the tom insertion site. One of these genes, called Om(1D), has               been isolated and found to encode a homeobox containing protein.                In addition to 25 different optic morphology (Om) mutants,                      mobilization of the tom element has allowed the identification of               suppressors and enhancers of Om mutations. One of these                         suppressors, Om(1K)Su, reverses the mutant phenotype caused by                  insertion of tom in all 25 Om genes. This suggests that the                     suppressor gene may encode a function that is common to mutations               in all Om loci. Dr. Corces hypothesizes that this function may be               related to the ability of the tom element to induce over                        expression of the mutant gene, and therefore the Om(1K)Su gene                  may encode an eye specific transcription factor that interacts                  with the tom element. He proposes here to study the mechanisms by               which the tom element causes eye specific phenotypes and                        determine the role in eye development of genes affected by Om                   mutations. The tissue specific expression of the Om(1D) gene at                 different developmental stages will be determined and a genetic                 analyses of the recessive phenotype of the Om(1D) gene will be                  carried out. The suppressor Om(1K)Su gene will be cloned and                    characterized as will its pattern of expression. Its protein will               be expressed in E. coli and isolated and biochemical assays will                be used to determine putative interactions between this protein                 and the Om(1D) gene and/or the tom element. Finally, the                        mechanism of mutagenesis by the tom element will be investigated.               Sequences of the tom element responsible for its mutagenic effect               will be identified by a combination of molecular and genetic                    approaches.",
