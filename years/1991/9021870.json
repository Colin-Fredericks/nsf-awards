 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Ithaca              College for the replacement of obsolete plant growth facilities by              a new Controlled Environment Laboratory Complex for plant and                   invertebrate research.  This complex will be a part of a new                    science building which will house Ithaca College's biological                   research and research training activities.  This building to be                 replaced was constructed in 1964 and has not been renovated since               that time and its replacement is fully justified and cost-                      effective.  The ARFMP grant of $375,000 and $378,220 provided by                the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these                     research and research training facilities.  This project will                   address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by              providing modern facilities essential to continued research                     productivity and the training of undergraduates for advanced work.              The replacement will provide a new greenhouse, plant growth rooms,              plant growth and insect chambers, and space for tissue culture                  work.                                                                                                                                                           This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate students many of whom                 continue on for advanced training.  Students trained in these                   laboratories will be able to participate in crucial areas of plant              research including environmental protection, evolutionary                       genetics, plant development, and plant molecular genetics as well               as in research on insects and other invertebrates.",
