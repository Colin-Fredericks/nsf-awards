The Indian organizer is Dr. Ashok                           Misra, professor at the Indian Institute of Technology                          (IIT) in New Delhi.  Three areas of polymer research                            considered to be at the forefront will be covered.  These                       are: polymers for  photonics, where nonlinear optical                           properties of polymers show great promise; polymers for                         electronics, where new conduction mechanisms and                                photophysics have generated considerable enthusiasm; and                        high performance polymers which exhibit exceptionally high                      mechanical strength coupled with lightweight.  The                              conference will include a workshop to identify research                         opportunties, especially where collaboration can be                             effected.  The program committee include scientists from                        India, the U.S., Japan, FRG, Austria, Netherlands, Italy                        and Switzerland, thus a broad international participation                       is expected.  Conference proceedings is expected to be                          published as well as recommendations on research needs.                                                                                                         Scope:  The topics of the conference are quite timely,                          because of recent discovery in the physics and                                  photophysical properties of new polymers, and the new                           research approaches to understanding and synthesizing their                     materials.  The U.S. and India both are conducting                              extensive research in academic and industrial                                   laboratories.  The two cooperating scientists are well                          known and active researchers in the field.  The conference                      is quite likely to have a positive impact on U.S.-India                         cooperation in scientific research in chemistry and                             polymerscience.",
