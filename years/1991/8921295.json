The material chosen for emphasis is                           quartz which is of great tectonic importance in the                             earth's crust.  Its textures also vary greatly in                               geological conditions.  Together, the researchers plan                          to measure pole figures on deformed quartzites from                             different classical localities and prepare a catalog of                         ODFs with the PP method.  Results should provide a more                         quantitative interpretation of quartz textures in terms                         of their geophysical deformation history.                                                                                                                       This project in geophysics fulfills the program objective                       of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                           researchers in the United States and Poland to combine                          complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of                              strong mutual interest and competence in the field of                           basic scientific research on the basis of equality,                             reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
