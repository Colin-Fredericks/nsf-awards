 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global forces are underway that result in opportunities for visibly             different ethnic groups to interact in public contexts on an                    increasingly equal basis.  The effects of increased social                      interaction and of changing social and legal contexts on                        perceptions of and memory for individuals of other groups is a                  topic of perennial scholarly interest.  The accuracy of cross-                  racial eyewitness identification is an important area of concern;               yet, there is no consensus in the scholarly community about the                 psychological mechanisms which affect these judgments.  This is an              area in which there are interesting theoretical developments that               have implications for both formal and informal interactions among               people of different groups.                                                                                                                                     This project is for a planning grant to facilitate development of               a research project that will assess factors associated with global              changes in racism, discrimination, and ethnic conflict.  The                    project being planned will focus, in particular, on the effects of              social structure, social experience, and attitudes on cross-racial              identification in the Republic of South Africa as the legal system              of apartheid or \"separateness\" is dismantled. At the core of the                approach is the notion that the relative heterogeneity of the                   social resources afforded by a particular group will determine the              ability of individuals to differentiate on the basis of facial and              other appearance.  The more homogeneously another race is viewed                in social terms, the less likelihood of individual recognition.                 During this planning period the investigators will (1) establish                a multi-national, multi-discipline, multi-racial research team that             will participate in the research; (2) travel to South Africa to                 discuss research plans and study materials; and (3) develop a                   comprehensive plan for the subsequent research.                                                                                                                 This research addresses an important dimension of racial and social             conflict and has specific implications for cross-racial eyewitness              identification and reliability.  The results of the study will                  enable revising existing theory to accommodate multicultural                    dimensions of racial bias.  The research will also contribute to                our understanding of broader issues of social perception.",
