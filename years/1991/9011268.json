 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern bimolecular research in the time domain requires a broad                 range of reliable laser based instruments to cover the                          wavelengths, pulse energies and time scales necessary for a                     comprehensive study.  Typically, these instruments are scattered                or not routinely available.  Thus, a means of enhancing and                     facilitating such biophysical studies is to bring together the                  needed instruments into a central facility where researchers can                address research problems in a comprehensive and coherent                       fashion.  We are in the process of creating such a facility in                  the Chemistry Department at NYU.                                                                                                                                Partial support is requested for instrumentation to help create a               state-of-the-art laser spectroscopy facility, designed for and                  dedicated to optical studies of biological macromolecules --                    their structures, dynamics and functions.  This instrumentation                 will be used to investigate a number of problems of current                     importance, including:  the role of conformational disorder in                  the control of protein function; energy and electron transfer                   mechanisms; protein folding and denaturation pathways; the                      structure and dynamics of metal binding sites and hydration                     layers in proteins and nucleic acids; nucleic acid dynamics; and                photophysical and photochemical and photochemical processes in                  molecules of biological significance.                                                                                                                           The requested instrumentation includes three laser systems to                   provide time resolution from .15 ps to CW and tunability from 200               to 900nm.  Spectrometers, multichannel detection, instrumentation               for rapid mixing and cryogenic trapping of samples, will make                   available a wide range of experimental options for time resolved                and steady state Raman, absorption and fluorescence using these                 laser sources.  A recent grant from the Kresge Foundation ($250K)               will be used to purchase additional equipment to enhance the                    versatility and usefulness of the facility.  A condition of this                award is that NYU raise a one million dollar endowment to provide               for the maintenance of the facility, a campaign that is just                    getting under way.                                                                                                                                              The location and design of the facility are specifically geared                 to facilitate biological studies.  The facility, which will be                  jointly maintained by three of the ten major users, is to be made               available for both collaborative and independent projects,                      including provision for use by academic and industrial external                 users.",
