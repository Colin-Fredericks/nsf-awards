 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major thrust of the Drexel University program focusses on the               recruitment and retention of the target groups which are currently              underrepresented in the graduate engineering fields.  A multi-                  pronged approach is utilized to inform and attract the target                   groups into the PhD program through media advertising in                        appropriate journals, presentations at engineering education                    conferences, and through personal contacts with faculty and                     professional staff in engineering education across the U.S.  To                 assure the continued success of the program, contacts will also be              established and maintained with the undergraduate engineering                   programs and regional high schools through existing outreach                    programs at Drexel.  There is a mentor system to create an                      educational, social and emotional environment conducive to                      fostering successful acclimation and advancement of the recruited               students.  The object is to oversee and assist the progress of the              students from enrollment to employment.  An optional Industrial                 Internship Program will be developed to encourage industrial                    participation, and to increase the financial resources available                to the students.  The NSF funds are viewed as seed money, namely                for establishing the program and for leveraging external funds                  through industrial, private, state and University sources to                    sustain the program on a regular basis.",
