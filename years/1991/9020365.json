 "awd_abstract_narration": "A graphical workstation for use of the UNIDATA system to                   receive and process meteorological data at the University of                    Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography will be acquired.                  UNIDATA is the NSF-subsidized system allowing university                        departments access to real-time weather data, forecasts and                     specialized satellite images.  Data transmitted via satellite are               ingested and decoded by networked computers; they may be stored                 or used in displays, in diagnostic calculations or perhaps in                   experimental forecasts.  At URI the required satellite receiving                gear is in place and has been in stable operation for four years.               The workstation acquired would augment the Educational Computer                 Laboratory, which presently has microcomputers and workstations                 on a local area network.  The UNIDATA software will be installed                and used in display analysis and archive meteorological data for                the purpose of teaching and research for strongly                               interdisciplinary programs.  Those studying atmospheric                         chemistry, physical oceanography and paleoclimatology are likely                to benefit most from the augmented laboratory facilities.                       Dedicated computers in laboratories across campus can access the                local network, and the system will also be used in these research               environments.  An example of such use is control or monitoring of               conditions for the planning or conduct of field experiments.",
