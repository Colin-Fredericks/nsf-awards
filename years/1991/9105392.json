 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nodulin genes are plant genes which are specifically induced                    during the formation of nitrogen-fixing root- stem nodules on                   leguminous plants.  Early nodulin (Enod) genes are expressed                    within 10 days after inoculation and play a role in the rhizobial               infection process and nodule ontogeny.  Enod genes are not only                 symbiotically induced and developmentally controlled, but are                   also expressed in a tissue specific manner.  The Enod2 gene is                  symbiotically activated in the nodule parenchyma cells and                      encodes a hydroxyproline rich protein, which probably is targeted               to the plant cell wall, where it may be involved in creating an                 oxygen diffusion barrier.  The focus of this proposal is to                     elucidate the signal transduction pathway involved in the                       expression of the Enod2 gene from the tropical stem-nodulated                   legume, Sesbania rostrata (SrEnod2).  The SrEnod2 gene can be                   induced rapidly and specifically by physiologically significant                 concentrations of cytokinins.  This gene is therefore not only an               ideal candidate to study nodule-specific plant gene expression,                 but also serves as a unique model to study plant gene induction                 be cytokinin.  The ability to manipulate the bacterial \"inducer\"                offers a powerful experimental approach to study the process of                 plant cell division and differentiation.",
