 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on three major efforts.  First, a                           mechanistic study on Co-Rh mixed metal catalyst systems will be                 carried out to probe catalysis by Co-Rh bimetallic di- and                      tetranuclear complexes with regard to the highly regio- and                     stereoselective silylformylation and hydrosilylation of                         1-alkynes.  Second, applications of the silylformylation                        reaction to the silylformylation-annulation of alkynyl amines                   and silylformylation-carbocyclization will be examined as a                     route to functionalized heterocycles.  Third, approaches to                     effective asymmetric induction will be studied by the use of                    chelation-directed regio- and stereocontrol in carbonylations.                  %%%                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program renews support of                 the research of Dr. Iwao Ojima of the Department of Chemistry                   at the State University of New York, Stonybrook.  The ultimate                  goal of the work is to design and develop multi-functional                      multi-catalyst systems that will enable the chemist to carry                    out multi-step synthesis in one reaction vessel in a highly                     organized manner.  The research wiil provide new and efficient                  synthetic methods, and an improved understanding of both                        bimetallic catalysis and regio- and stereocontrol mediated by                   transition metal complexes.",
