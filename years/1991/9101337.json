 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports collaborative research on algebraic                         geometry.  Robert Lax of Louisiana State University is an                       expert on Weierstrass points on complex Gorenstein curves,                      while Arnaldo Garcia of IMPA (Rio de Janeiro) is an expert on                   curves in positive characteristic.  The notions of classical and non            classical curves will be extended to singular curves.                           Questions concerning classicality of curves and normalization                   and classicality of curves and degenerations will be                            considered.                                                                                                                                                     On smooth curves in characteristic zero, the investigators                      will study possible weights and gap sequences of Weierstrass                    points on curves that are two-sheeted covers of other curves.                   On smooth curves in positive characteristic, the investigators                  will study relation between the defining equation and the                       classicality of the curve.  Finally, on curves over finite                      fields, the investigators will study relations between the                      Weierstrass gap sequence at a point and geometric Goppa codes                   defined using a multiple of that point.  The question of the                    number of rational points on curves with certain types of                       Weierstrass points will also be considered.  While this                         research is sure mathematics, there exists the potential for                    important application in coding theory due to the connections                   with Goppa codes.",
