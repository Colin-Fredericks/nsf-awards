 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computer-aided test station, including bust test equipment                    (power supplies, signal generator, digital oscilloscope,                        multimeters, switching unit), a microcomputer controller and                    appropriate software will be established for the testing of thick               and thin film hybrid circuits.  The computer and test equipment                 will add major capabilities not now available in the senior-level               hybrid circuit program.                                                                                                                                         The thick film technology program at Drexel serves approximately                60 students per year.  The Thick Film Laboratory serves as a                    circuit prototyping facility where students work in design groups               of 4 to 6 to fabricate circuits of their own design.  All                       fabrication processes are done in-house by the students. The                    principal purpose of the equipment in this proposal will be the                 automatically test the functionality of the designed circuits,                  with the capability of handling circuits will serve as teaching                 examples for learning test programming techniques as well as                    illustrating basic hybrid circuit concepts.  The equipment will                 also be used as a design station for circuit layout and                         simulation.",
