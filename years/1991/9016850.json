 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the participation of eight US                   scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on \"Molecular Biology                    of Marine Invertebrate Development\". In the last 15 years,                      primarily through advances in the field of molecular biology,                   considerable progress has been made in our basic understanding                  of the major issues involved in development. The study of                       marine invertebrate embryos has played an important role in                     this progress by providing a good model for analyzing the                       fundamental problems of development.  For example, sperm-egg                    interactions in general and fertilization in particular have                    always been areas where marine invertebrate research has lead                   the way. Another area of immense importance is how genes                        preside over the complex process of morphogenesis, and the                      accessibility of marine embryos makes them a particularly                       favorable material for the study of this process. Development-                  al biology of marine invertebrates has been a traditionally                     active field of research in both the US and Japan since the                     beginning of this century and this seminar should therefore                     provide an excellent forum for researchers in the two                           countries to compare results and discuss future research in                     this area.                                                                                                                                                      The seminar is to be held on April 3-6 1991 at the Kewalo                       Marine Laboratory of the University of Hawaii, Honolulu,                        Hawaii.  The co-organizers are Professor Fred H Wilt,                           Molecular cell biology unit, University of California,                          Berkeley, and Professor Hiraku Shimada, Department of Zoology,                  Hiroshima University, Japan.  Specific topics to be discussed                   at the seminar will concentrate on cell-cell interactions                       including (1) the biology of cell-environmental interactions;                   (2) the molecular biology of morphogenesis; and (3) specific                    gene expression.  The seminar is especially timely as the                       last seminar in this topic, between these two countries, was                    held ten years ago and enormous advances have been achieved                     since that time.  It is expected that ongoing collaborative                     projects and exchanges of scientists will occur as a result                     of this seminar.",
