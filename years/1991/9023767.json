 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preliminary funding evidence and anectodal information are causing              a great deal of concern in academic, government and industrial                  circles that increasing numbers of young people may be discouraged              from careers in academic biological and biomedical research because             of the difficulty that investigators are having in obtaining                    funding.  Young investigators are critical for the expansion of the             fundamental biological knowledge base ranging from ecology to                   medicine.  This knowledge fuels academic, industrial and economic               growth.  The Commission on Life Sciences of the National Research               Council proposes to examine the funding issue by convening a                    committee of experts.  While it is not the intent of this activity              to reinvestigate pipeline issues, the committee will review this                subject where relevant to this study.  The committee will                       specifically address current funding mechanisms for young                       investigators in the biological and biomedical sciences by major                federal agencies and private organizations, the current state of                funding by these entities, and the major problems and constraints               in the funding system.  The committee will determine the impact of              these issues on the ability to recruit and retain young researchers             in academics and will report the details of each point and include              recommendations on ways to improve their funding situation in a                 report.  This project is expected to take 15 months, at an                      estimated cost of $373,410 derived from federal and private                     sources.  An award of $25,000 is recommended.",
