 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells communicate with each other by secreting chemical                   messengers known as neurotransmitters.  Exocytosis, a form of                   secretion, is a cellular process which involves the fusion of                   membranes, resulting in the discharge of substances from cells.                 Though poorly understood, the mechanism of exocytosis is of                     fundamental importance for understanding synaptic transmission                  and intercellular communication between cells.  The goal of this                research project is to ascertain the steps involved in the                      regulation of exocytosis that occur in neuronal and paraneuronal                cells.  Dr. Holz will examine the role of annexins, a class of                  lipoproteins, in the process of exocytosis.  Previous results                   suggest that annexins play a significant role in the normal                     secretory pathway.  Experiments using cultured chromaffin cells                 will be used to determine if annexins interact with granule, a                  specialized cell product involved in secretion, and to test the                 possibility that annexins may regulate the binding of granule to                the plasma membrane.  Results of these studies are likely to be                 applicable to the understanding of presynaptic events in synaptic               transmission.",
