 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Western Mathematics Scholars Program is a regional teacher                  enhancement effort for teachers of grades seven through twelve                  in Colorado, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and                          Wyoming. Each of 126 teachers will participate in the program                   for two full summers and academic years. The program includes                   a five-week summer institute, to be offered each of two                         summers at three campus sites (South Dakota School of Mines                     and Technology, Chadron State College in Nebraska, and                          Cheyenne Community College in Wyoming.)                                                                                                                         Each summer, 42 teachers will participate at each site. They                    will take courses in discrete mathematics, data analysis,                       geometric perspectives, and modeling with modern technology.                    Each course includes concept exploration and development,                       together with laboratory sessions focusing on classroom                         implementation. Special speakers and extra sessions are                         included; as part of the teacher enhancement process,                           exemplary modules demonstrating the use of project approaches                   in classrooms will be developed by the participants.                                                                                                            During the academic year, teachers will implement project                       ideas in their classrooms, conduct inservice activities in                      their local areas, and attend regional followup meetings. The                   project extends the successful model of the Nebraska                            Mathematics Scholars program (TPE 8550604) by providing                         opportunities for teachers throughout five states to become                     involved.                                                                                                                                                       The project is administered through the University of                           Nebraska-Lincoln; subcontracts are included for Colorado State                  University, the University of South Dakota, Minot State                         University in North Dakota, and the University of Wyoming.                                                                                                      Cost sharing is provided by participants' schools and other                     sources as 19% of the NSF award.",
