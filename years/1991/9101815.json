 "awd_abstract_narration": "The time immediately following the metamorphosis and settlement                 of benthic organisms is critical to their ability to become part                of the existing community.  Because of their small size and                     simpler morphology, juveniles endure more intense interactions                  with a wider spectrum of species.  In addition, tremendous                      changes in the ecological relationships between species can                     occur between life-history stages and the importance of these                   ontogenetic changes in relationships is unknown.  This project                  will focus on the settling and juvenile stages of 7 dominant                    species within subtidal marine epifaunal communities along the                  coast of southern New England.  The study sites chosen exhibit                  extreme (1 to 2 orders of magnitude) differences in larval                      settlement, and each has a distinct group of dominant species.                  Experiments will be conducted to test processes that have the                   demonstrated potential to alter the importance of predation to                  recruitment, i.e. differences in larval settlement and                          competitive interactions involving juveniles.  Finally, we will                 examine how relationships change with life-stage.  The                          importance of any event occurring during juvenile life-history                  stages will be judged relative to phenomena occurring during                    larval settlement and within the adult community.",
