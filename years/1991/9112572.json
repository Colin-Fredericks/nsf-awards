 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the conference \"Directions              and Implications of Advanced Computing (DIAC-92)\" to be held in                 Berkeley, California on May 2-3, 1992.  The objective of the                    conference is to help build an understanding of a wide range of                 social and ethical concerns relating to computing technology.  The              approach is to sponsor an open scientific forum and disseminate the             results.  Presenters at the symposium include invited speakers as               well as those selected on the basis of submitted papers.  An                    interdisciplinary, broadly representative group of persons with                 expertise and interest in impacts of computing form the selection               committee.  Results include a proceedings as well as other                      publications in a wide variety of outlets.  The funds from NSF will             be used to support some travel, publicity, and printing costs of                the proceedings for the conference.                                                                                                                             The topic of this proposal is of highest priority for Ethics and                Values Studies.  The qualifications and track record of the                     investigators and organization are excellent.  The project provides             an important effort to encourage interdisciplinary communication                about important social and ethical concerns associated with new                 developments in computing.  Results will be useful for a wide range             of individuals and groups.  The budget is modest.  The proposal is              recommended for support.",
