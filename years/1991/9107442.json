 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance of traditional industrial crystallizers                         differs appreciably from that of laboratory crystallizers.  In                  industry, for instance, a sustained cycling in crystal size                     distribution (CSD) is usually observed, which has not been                      reproduced p to now in the laboratory.  This cycling result,                    for at least part of the time, in product whose CSD is                          undesirable and in the lowering of the productivity of the                      crystallizer.  This investigation tests a physical model which                  has been proposed to explain the cycling in the large                           crystallizers.  The experiments are performed in a laboratory                   set-up consisting of two interconnected well mixed                              crystallizers.  These crystallizers simulate the two zones                      which exists in a large crystallizer.  In the one zone                          supersaturation is created an primary nucleation occurs.  The                   supersaturation is transferred to the other zone and is                         consumed primarily by growth and to a lesser degree by                          secondary nucleation.  In the laboratory set-up                                 supersaturation and growing crystals are transferred from on                    crystallizer to the other by flow streams, whose rates are                      measured and controlled.  Other independent variables include                   the degree of classification of the transferred crystals, the                   independent supersaturations in the two crystallizers, and the                  crystallizers temperatures.  The crystallizing systems                          examined are potassium chloride and ammonium sulfate.  In                       addition, a method is based on liquid density measurements by                   a PAAR Densimeter, model DMA 60.  The experiments are designed                  to model the conditions under which cycling occurs or does not                  occur and to point out ways to control the cycling by                           modifying the design and the operating conditions of the                        industrial crystallizers.",
