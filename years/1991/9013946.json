 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Drs.                     A.K. Pradhan and D. Mihalas, Ohio State University, and two                     groups of British astronomers under the direction of Dr.                        P.G. Burke, Queens University, Belfast and Dr. M. Seaton,                       University College, London. The objective of the proposed                       research is to carry out accurate large scale calculations                      of atomic data and stellar opacities.                                                                                                                           For the last seven years a major international project has                      been underway to carry out large scale atomic calculations                      with the final aim of calculating stellar opacities of                          unprecedented precision.  The opacity of stellar material                       plays a fundamental role in the structure and evolution of                      stars, as it controls the transport of radioactive energy in                    some regions of virtually all stars.  The stellar opacity is                    also intrinsically involved in the instabilities that give                      rise to stellar pulsation, which are important in a number                      of respects in current astronomical research.  The aim of                       the proposed research project, which is a joint collaboration                   between atomic physicists and astronomers in the United-                        Kingdom, the U.S., the Federal Republic of Germany, France                      and Venezuela, is to employ state-of-the-art atomic physics                     methods that are capable of yielding the basic atomic                           parameters, such as oscillator strengths and photoionization                    cross sections, to a high degree of accuracy in the range of                    5-10%.  The project is being led by Drs. M. Seaton and P.G.                     Burke.  This award will permit the participation of members                     of the U.S. team. The collaboration will benefit from the                       extensive expertise of Dr. Mihalas in stellar atmosphere                        theory and Dr. Pradhan in atomic physics.",
