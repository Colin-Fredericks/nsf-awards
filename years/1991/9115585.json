 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is considerable industrial interest in the development               of Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) of material powders into a truly                net or near-net shape.  The objective of this research is to set                the basis for the development of an efficient methodology to                    predict shape changes in HIP.  The study will characterize the two              principal causes of shape distortion:  (1) the effect of powder                 container stiffness, and (2) the formation of densification fronts              by inhomogeneous heating.  Iron powder will be used as a first                  target material for its mechanical behavior is well understood.                 Commercially pure titanium will be investigated in a second stage               as relevant material data becomes available.  The response of the               iron powder material to stress and temperature will be simulated                via an internal variable constitutive model.  The model will be                 calibrated and incorporated in a coupled thermo-mechanical finite               element code streamlined for HIP applications.  A novel hot                     triaxial compaction apparatus will be used to provide data for the              calibration of the constitutive model.  In the final stage,                     experiments in an industrial scale will be performed to validate                the overall HIP predictive capabilities.                                             The primary benefit of this work will be: (a) the capability               of assessing the manufacturability of a component via HIP, (b) the              design of a container with a minimum number of trial parts, (c)                 efficient programming of the HIP unit operation schedule as the                 effect of cycle and workpiece distribution in the unit work zone                becomes better understood, and  (d) exploration of new products                 with the potential to influence the design of a new generation of               HIP units.",
