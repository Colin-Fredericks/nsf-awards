 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will employ                     analytical and numerical methods to study the behavior of                       solutions of the system of partial differential equations that                  describes combustion phenomena in a reactive multi-phase flow.                  In particular, he will look at the following three inter-related                problems for reactive multi-phase flows:  the transition to                     detonation, the structure of detonation waves, and the modelling                of phenomena at low Mach number,i.e., subsonic flow.  A                         substantial part of the project involves replacing the complex                  set of equations with simpler, asymptotic versions whose                        solutions still retain the essential physics of the phenomena.                  The goal is to increase our understanding of the complex physics                that governs the formation and evolution of flames in combustible               granular flows.                                                                      Combustion phenomena form a visible and important  part of                 everyday life.  Understanding the complex physical and chemical                 processes that occur when liquids and gases burn is therefore of                interest to a host of scientists and engineers.  Much of the work               on combustion phenomena today is experimental and/or numerical,                 but the complexity of the problems often defeats even the largest               supercomputer.  And experiments at high temperatures are often                  too difficult or too expensive to perform.  In this project the                 principal investigator will use asymptotic methods to simplify                  the complicated set of nonlinear equations that governs                         combustion in gases.  He will then analyze this simpler set of                  equations in order to develop a better understanding of the                     propagation of flames in a granular flow.",
