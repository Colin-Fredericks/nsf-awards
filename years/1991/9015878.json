 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators will study the partial                         differential equations and integro-differential equations that                  model semiconductor devices by using analytical and numerical                   methods.  Their work will span the entire range from the actual                 derivation of the basic equations to the solution of concrete                   boundary value problems.  In particular, the investigators will                 study the Boltzmann equation and systems derived from it such as                the hydrodynamic model and the drift-diffusion model using                      asymptotic methods.                                                                  The systems of differential equations that describe the                    behavior of semiconductor devices are difficult to solve                        analytically.  Even large computers are unable to resolve aspects               of the solutions accurately.  Thus there is a great need for                    approximate theories that contain enough of the physics of the                  devices to be realistic and yet are tractable mathematically.                   The principal investigators will derive approximate models of                   semiconductors and study them with asymptotic and numerical                     methods, in order to understand the workings of actual devices.",
