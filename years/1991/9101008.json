 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biochemistry at                  Alma College to initiate a summer undergraduate research                        experience for eight students.  A substantial portion of                        participants will be recruited from Stillman College, a                         historically black institution.  Participants will learn modern                 methodology in the areas of molecular genetics and insect                       reproductive biochemistry of flour beetles in the family                        Tenebrionidae.  Students will progress from work on a common                    project (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) to independent                     investigations involving techniques such as:  ELISAs, Western                   blotting, immunohistochemistry, DNA purification, DNA                           compositional analysis, genomic library preparation and                         screening, and gene sequencing.  Special attention will be given                to enabling the students to become expert in a few techniques                   while understanding the ramifications of all techniques used in                 the project.  Each student will be responsible for integrating                  all data generated through the above techniques for a particular                species under their care culminating in a written report.  Weekly               meetings involving all participants will maximize scientific data               exchange, and cooperation among research peers.  In addition to                 the laboratory component, participants will be exposed to                       scientists as role models during site visits to local industrial                and academic locations.  Additional scientists will be brought to               Alma College for in-depth discussions concerning scientific                     careers and their professional preparation.  As a part of the                   follow-up process, contact with students will be maintained and                 assistance will be offered with career choices throughout the                   subsequent academic year.",
