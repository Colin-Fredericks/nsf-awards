 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on accurate models of the electrical performance               of interconnections on digital circuits.  Maintenance of the                    fidelity of a signal as it propagates through various                           interconnections is a key factor in proper functioning of                       integrated circuits (IC's).  For very high-speed IC's, there is a               complicated electromagnetic nature of the signal propagation.                   Accurate models of the complex interconnection structures are                   difficult to obtain.  In the model being developed transient                    responses of signal propagation through interconnections are                    represented by the three-dimensional, full-wave, finite difference              solution of Maxwell's equations in the time domain.  This solution              is being developed to conform to the interconnection geometries                 found in multilayer IC's.  Attention is being paid to excitation                and absorbing boundary conditions to ensure a high degree of                    numerical accuracy.  Various interconnection structures are being               analyzed, with special consideration being given to bends of                    different angles (connections on the same layer) and vias of                    different geometries (connections between adjacent layers).",
