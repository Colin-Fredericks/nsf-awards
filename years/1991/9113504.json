The Board provides a focal point for                         studies related to environmental engineering aspects of                         water management.  The Board's objective is to improve the                      scientific and technological basis for resolving important                      questions and issues relating to water and wastewater                           aspects of environmental engineering practice.  An                              important function of the Board is to sponsor workshops                         and conferences that are utilized for program planning                          purposes.  The Board also functions as an appropriate                           means for coordination of research plans with other                             Federal agencies including FEMA, USGS, EPA, DOE, and the                        U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
