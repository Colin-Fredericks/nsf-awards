 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enable the School of Planning at the                          University of Cincinnati to teach undergraduate planning                        students how to use microcomputer-based imaging and animation                   as a way of simulating then evaluating alternative urban design                 proposals.  The School's courses in still-imaging are open to                   other undergraduates as well (for example, from architecture).                  The School and the University have invested in the                              microcomputer hardware necessary for animation. AT&T donated                    the animation software.  However, we lack the proper recording                  equipment.  Hence, we are requesting NSF support for the                        purchase of a video disk recorder to record urban planning and                  design animation projects done by students.  Also, we will                      purchase a rapid rendering board that reduces the rendering                     time per image by an approximate factor of ten, thus enabling                   more students to use our single animation station.  This                        project is significant in planning because it will enable                       students to create dynamic simulations of alternative design                    proposals in a microcomputer environment.  We feel that this                    could become an important professional skill for our students                   given the interest already expressed by prospective employers.",
