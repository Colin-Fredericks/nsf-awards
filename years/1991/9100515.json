 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Dr. C. Vance Haynes, Mr. Michael K. Faught                will collect information for his doctoral dissertation.  In the                 first stage of the research, Mr. Faught will employ a geopulse                  devise to map underwater features and relict river segments along               the Aucilla river channel which is located in Florida's Apalachee               Bay.  In particular, an attempt will be made to locate underwater               sinkholes.  With the data thus acquired, a second phase of the                  work will focus on the coring of promising areas.  These cores                  will be photographed and examined for pollen, macro botanical                   remains, sediment characteristics and radiocarbon samples.  The                 ultimate objectives of the work are to find bone bed                            accumulations which are likely spots for Paleo-Indian remains,                  and to construct a sedimentary profile out from the current                     Aucilla River mouth onto the continental shelf.  The geological                 data thus obtained will further aid the discovery of underwater                 archaeological sites.                                                                                                                                           Remains of extinct animals and Paleo-indian artifacts are                       frequently found in the karst sinkholes of Northwestern Florida                 along with clear stratigraphic evidence for Holocene                            environmental change.  These sinkholes were reliable sources of                 water for late Pleistocene animals, hunting sites used by                       prehistoric people and traps for subsequent sediment                            accumulations.  So far, however, all these sinkholes have been                  disturbed by amateur diver/collectors before geoarchaeological                  scrutiny could take place.  Sinkholes currently located offshore                in this region can solve this problem because they most likely                  contain extinct faunal remains as well as archaeological                        materials.  (At the end of the Pleistocene sea levels were lower                than at present.)  Numerous offshore archaeological sites have                  been located offshore in this area, but no one has yet probed the               inundated relict karst river channels for their protected early                 archaeology.                                                                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons.  It will,                       hopefully, locate sites which can be excavated in future years by               Mr. Faught as well as other archaeologists.  It will increase our               understanding of the native American past and assist in the                     training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
