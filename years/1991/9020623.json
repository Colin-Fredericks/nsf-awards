 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                     Chemistry, focuses on surface processes that are induced by                     collisions of gas particles with surface bound species.  The                    work addresses the important \"pressure gap\" which attempts to                   relate chemistry at ultra-high vacuum and low pressures to real                 situations at high pressure.  This type of investigation is                     needed if surface science studies are to impact many important                  applications.                                                                                                                                                   The current studies of dissociative chemisorption of adsorbates                 will be extended to examine previously undocumented collision                   induced surface processes.  Collision induced dissociative                      chemisorption will be developed as a method to probe the                        reaction coordinate for thermal dissociation of adsorbates and                  as a tool to synthesize novel adsorbates.   Mechanisms for                      these processes will be examined.  Molecular beam techniques                    will be coupled with high resolution electron energy loss                       spectroscopy for these studies, and this spectroscopy will also                 be developed as a probe for subsurface and bulk vibrations.",
