Precast concrete tilt-up structures                                             are widely used throughout the U.S.                                             for one and two-story warehouses,                                               office buildings, and shopping                                                  centers.  Tilt-up structures are                                                economical to build; however, they                                              are susceptible to severe structural                                            damage during earthquakes.                                                                                                                                      The objective of this project is to                                             develop guidelines for evaluating                                               the seismic hazards in existing                                                 tilt-up construction and develop                                                methods for mitigating those                                                    hazards.  The work focuses on four                                              areas:  (1) connection of the roof                                              diaphragm to the tilt-up wall                                                   panels, (2) connection between                                                  adjacent wall panels, (3) connection                                            of the wall panels to the floor slab                                            and foundation, and (4) strength and                                            stability of wall panels with large                                             openings.  Analytical models will be                                            developed to calculate the dynamic                                              response of building systems used                                               throughout the U.S. and laboratory                                              tests of representative details and                                             structural systems will be                                                      performed.",
