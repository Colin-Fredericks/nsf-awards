 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spatial and temporal variations in strain path and shear sense             associated with emplacement will be documented for the Papoose flat             pluton of eastern California.  This pluton has been considered a                classic example of forceful emplacement in a coaxial strain field               on the basis of earlier petrographic studies of the pluton's                    marginal facies and its surrounding country rocks.  Recent                      reevaluation of the published petrofabric data from the pluton                  shows, however, that a uniform sense of asymmetry exists in the                 fabric diagrams that is consistent with pluton emplacement during               large scale non-coaxial shearing.  Microstructural and                          crystallographic fabric criteria will be used with data from                    rotated porphyroblasts and contract metamorphic mineral assemblages             to determine the strain path, temperature and shear sense during                pluton emplacement.  The kinematic and deformation processes                    operative will thus be determined and these data will constrain the             possible mechanisms of pluton emplacement.  The results of this                 study will greatly improve our understanding of pluton emplacement              mechanisms in general, and will also provide a much needed link                 between naturally produced deformation microstructives and those                produced experimentally and by computer simulation studies.",
