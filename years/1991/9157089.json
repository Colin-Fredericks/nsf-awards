 "awd_abstract_narration": "I will perform experimental and theoretical studies of                          optical communication systems and of related                                    supporting technologies.  Topics to be addressed in                             this program will include, but will not be limited to,                          the following representative areas:  (a) Coherent                               Optical Communications:  this work will explore the                             limits of receiver sensitivity and of electrical and                            optical bandwidth efficiency that can be achieved                               through advanced coherent detection techniques.                                 Initial studies will attempt to demonstrate homodyne                            detection using monolithic semiconductor lasers, as                             well as heterodyne detection of quadriphase-shift-                              keyed optical signals.  (b) Free-Space Infrared                                 Communications for Wireless Local-Area Networks:                                this research will seek to develop technologies for                             high-speed digital communication using free-space                               infrared propagation.  Initial studies will include                             measurement of infrared multipath indoor                                        propagation and analysis and simulation of the                                  performance of various modulation and demodulation                              techniques.  In following studies, I hope to                                    demonstrate a working high-speed local-area network                             that provides wireless access using this technique.  (c)                        High-Performance Optical-Fiber Networks:  this work                             will investigate how advanced optical communication                             technology can be used to construct networks having                             capacities up to three orders of magnitude larger than                          the emerging networks of today.  One initial study                              will address a hybrid approach to multimedia                                    networking, combining lumped electronic ATM                                     switching with distributed circuit switching based on                           subcarrier or optical-frequency-division multiplexing.                          (d) Optical Interconnects in High-Performance                                   Digital Systems:  This work will explore the                                    application of optical interconnects to high-                                   performance digital systems such as computers.                                  Initial research topics will include clock distribution                         within multi-chip modules and data communication at                             the back-plane level.",
