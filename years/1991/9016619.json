 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the participation of six US                     scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on \"Magmatic Contribu-                   tions to Hydrothermal Systems: Magnitude and Importance\".                       Hydrothermal systems form where heat and water meet in the                      earths crust.  One important aspect of research on hydrothermal                 systems is the role of magmas.  Continuing study of fossil                      and active hydrothermal systems makes it clear that magmas                      can contribute to these systems in several different ways but                   such contributions can be difficult to recognize and                            characterize.   Difficulties arise, for example, because                        magmatic contributions are small in relation to the total                       mass of the hydrothermal system and because they undergo                        rapid modification by reaction with other constituents of the                   system.  A further impediment is the wide range of disciplines                  involved including, for example, field geology, experimental                    geochemistry, thermodynamic modelling, water geochemistry and                   geophysics.  In order to gain a comprehensive understanding                     of the importance of magmatic contributions to the evolution                    of hydrothermal systems, interaction among scientists in                        these fields is required.                                                                                                                                       The seminar will be held Novemeber 10-16, 1991 at Kagoshima                     and Ebino, Kyushu, Japan. The co-organizers are Professor                       Stephen E Kesler, Department of Geology, University of                          Michigan, and Dr Eiji Izawa, Department of Mining, Kyushu                       University, Fukuoka, Japan.  Specific topics to be discussed                    include (1) igneous petrology of magmas; (2) the                                composition of volcanic discharges and their relation to                        magmatic fluids; (3) fluid inclusion and geochemical studies                    of epithermal and geothermal systems; and (4) chemical and                      physical modelling of magmatic hydrothermal systems.                            Although the US and Japan each have many Scientists active in                   this field, contact between these two groups is not as                          extensive as it could be.  The seminar will allow represent-                    atives from the two countries to meet and exchange                              information and it is anticipated that more extensive                           research collaboration will result.",
