 "awd_abstract_narration": "The constantly developing field of biotechnology is widely regarded             as one of the most vital scientific areas of potentially great                  importance.  It is essential that students at institutions of                   higher education, including community colleges, four-year colleges              and universities, be made aware of the principles and techniques                of this rapidly developing field. The workshop offers to                        participants direct exposure to a distinguished research faculty                in biotechnology and provides them with hands-on experiences in the             current techniques in both applied molecular biology and cell                   culture using state-of-the-art equipment in an effectively designed             teaching laboratory.  Participants  prepare reagents and                        demonstration materials that can readily be used at their home                  institutions and design exercises that will be feasible to perform              in laboratory courses at their home institutions. Following the                 intensive summer program, participants are kept informed of the                 newest developments in biotechnology through a specially designed               biotechnology seminar program held on the Rutgers-Newark campus                 during the academic year. Invited speakers include prominent                    research scientists from academia, from research institutes and                 from industry.",
