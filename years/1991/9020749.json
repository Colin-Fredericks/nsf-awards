 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims at developing a phenomenological model for                     describing distillation-column dynamics for multicomponent                      systems.  For improving practical design and control of                         fractionation columns the model appropriately describes the                     critical nonlinear and distributed nature of column dynamics                    with a mathematical framework which is concise enough for on-                   line control (e.g. feed forward controllers), control system                    analysis, and column design.  The ultimate goal is to make                      distillation columns operable at lower reflux ratios, and thus                  to lower energy consumption.  Better fundamental understanding                  of column dynamics will make it possible to upgrade existing                    columns and design new ones which are less sensitive to                         disturbances.  The research approach is based on the                            multicomponent coherence theory of simpler countercurrent                       separation processes such as fixed-bed chromatography theory.                   The theory is expanded by including the dynamics of reflux and                  reboil, interaction between two or more sections, and heat                      effects.  The theory and the dynamic model are tested by                        comparison with experimental results.  Experiments are carried                  out in an industrial laboratory with a pilot-plant-scale,                       computer controlled distillation column properly equipped with                  a fast gas chromatography system for on-line composition                        anonitoring.",
