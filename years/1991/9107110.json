 "awd_abstract_narration": "The limited host range (LHR) biovar strains of Agrobacterium                    tumefaciens form tumors on grapevine but on virtually no other                  plants.  Wide host range strains (WHR) fail to induce tumors on                 grapevine, but often induce necrosis at the site of inoculation.                We hope to understand the molecular basis of these several                      different interactions of LHR and WHR Agrobacterium strains with                grapevines as a model system for plant microbe interactions.  These             studies build on the physical and functional divergence of the VirA             protein in each strain and the critical role this protein plays in              plant signal transduction and plant cell transformation.  To                    distinguish transformation from tumor formation, the biological                 assays for plant cell transformation will be performed using a                  binary vector system carrying a B-glucuronidase gene behind a 35A               CaMV promoter.  To demonstrate the significance of the four domains             of VirA with host range, we will exchange domains between WHR and               LHR strains and observe the biological consequences.  We will                   isolate and identify compounds in grapevines that induce vir genes              in LHR and WHR strains and determine their sites of interaction                 with the VirA protein.  The locus responsible for inducing the                  necrotic response in grapevines will be identified by mutant                    analysis of T-DNA.",
