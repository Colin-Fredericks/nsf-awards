 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of the multidisciplinary nature of biotechnology, its                   incorporation into existing undergraduate introductory science                  courses, such as biology and chemistry, can contribute to the                   enrichment of these courses, as well begin to demonstrate                       lateral and horizontal connections between sciences which have                  been traditionally perceived as distinctly independent                          scientific disciplines. This proposal outlines a strategy for                   the development of high quality, creative curriculum models                     which will place emphasis on transferring basic core technology                 (theory, research and experimental procedures) utilized in                      biotechnology and adapt them to fit within the structure of the                 educational setting. The primary focus of these curriculum                      models will to be incorporate core technology, through theory                   and \"hands-on\" experiments, within a context that directly                      correlates and demonstrates relationships to recent                             developments and applications of biotechnology in such areas as                 medicine, agriculture, forensics and industrial procedures and                  processes. The faculty participants will develop curriculum                     modules which will be implemented and field tested at their                     respective colleges. Based upon field test evaluations, the                     curriculum modules will be refined, modified and re-                            implemented, and will provide the basis for the development of                  a biotechnology Curriculum and Resource Manual for widespread                   dissemination to undergraduate faculty.  The project's overall                  strategy strives to help promote scientific literacy to aid                     students in making important future decision which will affect                  their personal lives, as well as stimulate and influence some                   students to continue in scientific studies.",
