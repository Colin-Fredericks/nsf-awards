 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project demonstrates how the design activity, fully                        integrated with economic principles, can be effectively                         utilized to teach the engineering science component of the                      undergraduate curriculum.  A course is developed and taught                     that utilizes a design paradigm to teach engineering science                    principles in thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid                          dynamics.  Integrated in this subject matter are economic                       principles concerned with costing, design for manufacture and                   selection of design alternatives.  Additionally, a new course                   dealing with the economics of engineering design that bridges                   from the lower to the upper division is developed.  Professors                  from 4 different universities are involved in preparing                         educational materials for this new course and for the economics                 components of the modified engineering science core courses.                    Computer software and computer-based teaching aids focusing on                  the means for estimating cost-to-manufacture for various                        thermosystem components are developed.  Case studies focusing                   on economics principles in design are initiated.  Course                        materials such as computer modules of an intelligent tutoring                   system are developed.",
