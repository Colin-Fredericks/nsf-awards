 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Annmarie Surprenant of the Oregon Health Sciences University                    and Dr. Timothy O. Neild of Monash University, Australia. In                    the vascular systems of the body (blood and lymphatic) it is                    the smallest muscular vessels that play the greatest role in                    physiological regulation.  It has been extremely difficult                      in the past to make quantitative studies of the behavior of                     these vessels because they are too small to allow the                           attachment of mechanical devices to measure their contractions.                 It is possible to measure their movement by computer imaging                    but this approach had not been exploited because of the high                    cost of the equipment and the lack of suitable software.                        Computer image processing equipment is no longer prohibitively                  expensive and Dr. Surprenant's research team has developed a                    simple but novel algorithm for the measurement of small                         vessel diameter in real time.  In an existing grant to Dr.                      Suprenant from the National Science Foundation, she is                          developing the software required for video-tracking of                          microvessels.                                                                                                                                                   In this project, U.S.-standard video, image processing and                      computer hardware will be brought to Dr. Neild's laboratory                     to determine the combination of hardware and software to use                    in designing new systems based on a video tracking software                     program to monitor the diameter of arterioles embedded in                       connective tissue, developed in Dr. Neild's laboratory. The                     overall objective of the project is to develop systems that                     will be compatible and available in both countries.",
