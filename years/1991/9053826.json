 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of South Alabama in consortium with Vanderbilt                   University and the University of Alabama, Birmingham, will work                 with the 11 regional inservice centers to integrate the use of                  hypermedia into the education of preservice teachers.  The                      regional inservice centers are associated with the teacher                      education institutions in the state.  Vanderbilt University will                be responsible for initial faculty orientation and training in                  the use of hypermedia and interactive videodisc technology to                   provide a context for the integration of mathematics content and                pedagogy in the education of elementary school mathematics                      teachers.                                                                                                                                                       The purposes of the project are to develop a prototypical model                 of interactive laser videodisc instruction for mathematics                      teacher education, to disseminate this model and sample material,               and to determine the effectiveness of the use of interactive                    laser videodisc instruction in the mathematics education                        curriculum of eleven of Alabama teacher education programs.  Of                 particular interest is the diversity of the student populations                 in the sample the will be part of the intensive study of the                    effects of the use of the technology.  Two historically black                   institutions are in the group and one is included in the                        intensive sample.                                                                                                                                               The videodiscs that will the basis for the intervention were                    produced by a team at Vanderbilt University with a prior NSF                    grant, Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice...  This                    project will have state wide impact and will be a model of                      collaboration between universities and schools within a state.                                                                                                  At the same time, the project will allow a large scale evaluation               of the Vanderbilt materials.                                                                                                                                    The project will have impact on both the faculty of the eleven                  institution and on the perservice teachers that are in the                      programs at the universities. There will be 50 faculty  and 1,100               preservice teachers involved in the project.  In addition, the                  regional center will work with experienced teachers in each                     region to assess the use of such technology in teacher                          enhancement.  The number of experienced teachers reached will be                approximately 165, 15 per site.  Each regional center has                       responsibility for state sponsored teacher enhancement                          activities.  This gives a natural opportunity to expand the use                 of the materials.",
