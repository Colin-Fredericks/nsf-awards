 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports two undergraduates working under the                   direction of the principal investigator on problems in                          mathematical analysis and dynamical systems.  The work in                       analysis centers on geometric questions related to classes of                   continuous functions.  Specifically, the students will consider                 compositions of continuous function and the structures one                      obtains by forming convex combinations of the compositions.  The                work expands earlier investigations with combinations of measure                preserving transformations which occurs in the study of Markov                  operators.                                                                           Investigations into dynamical systems will focus on recently               developed ideas of pseudo-orbit shadowing.  Shadowing measures                  the degree to which an orbit can be traced by nearby orbits.  The               phenomenon is important because dynamical systems with the                      shadowing property can be modeled on a computer.                                     Students will be encouraged to present the results of their                work at professional meetings.",
