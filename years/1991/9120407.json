This project focuses on an                                                      experimental research program for                                               seismic rehabilitation of existing                                              connections between precast,                                                    reinforced concrete tilt-up walls                                               and their foundation to improve                                                 their seismic performance.  This                                                cost-effective construction type is                                             widely used for office buildings,                                               factories, stores, and warehouses.                                              It is estimated that about half of                                              the R/C industrial facilities are                                               built using tilt-up construction.                                                                                                                               Much of the work performed recently                                             in retrofitting tilt-up walls                                                   concentrated on the roof-wall                                                   connection as it is considered the                                              weakest link in the assembly.                                                   Little attention has been given to                                              another weak link which is the wall-                                            foundation connection.  Many of                                                 these existing connections lack                                                 adequate ductility and detailing and                                            could experience shear slip failure                                             under strong ground shaking.  The                                               project includes a detailed                                                     comparison between assumed and                                                  actual elastic and inelastic                                                    capacity of the foundation-wall                                                 connection; an evaluation of the                                                effectiveness of the corrective                                                 measures intended to increase the                                               connection strength and ductility;                                              and recommendations on evaluation                                               criteria and design guidelines for                                              the rehabilitation of existing                                                  structures.",
