 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research advisory committee of the National Council of                      Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) will sponsor a NCTM STANDARDS                    Research Catalyst Conference in March, 1991.  The purpose of                    this working conference is to define and stimulate research                     on the perspectives envisioned by the CURRICULUM AND                            EVALUATION STANDARDS FOR SCHOOL MATHEMATICS and to monitor                      the implementation of the STANDARDS within school settings.                     Without a collaborative research and monitoring effort,                         policy actions, curriculum development, assessment reform,                      and pedagogical innovation may proceed without the feedback                     necessary for systematic modification and informed decision-                    making.                                                                                                                                                         This conference will serve to set a research agenda and to                      catalyze research, development, and monitoring efforts that                     examine intended and implemented mathematics curriculum and                     assessment reform across the nation by stimulating                              complementary study within six focus areas are:  assessment,                    curriculum change, communication, policy, secondary core                        curriculum, and representation tools and models.  Conference                    attendance will be selected by application.  Special efforts                    will be made to include minorities, new researchers in                          mathematics education, mathematicians, and school                               practitioners in research teams directed by established                         leaders in mathematics education.  These leaders will serve                     as mentors who will organize the framework and the                              background papers of studies to be conducted by the                             participants and a research agenda monograph to be                              distributed by NCTM.  Long-term outcomes include research                       reporting presentations at the 1991 and 1992 NCTM Research                      Presessions and an interim summary of the resulting research                    and monitoring activities.",
