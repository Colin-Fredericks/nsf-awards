It will focus                                              on fossil fueled and nuclear power                                              plants, characteristic of complex,                                              large-scale systems amenable to                                                 analysis.  The fault diagnosis                                                  architecture is a network of neural                                             networks:  At the signal processing                                             level of the hierarchy, a recurrent                                             multilayer perceptron network is                                                used to recursively identify the                                                nonlinear plant dynamics, whereas                                               another neural network with similar                                             structure is used for state and                                                 parameter estimation purposes.  At                                              the decision making level of the                                                hierarchy, an adaptive critic                                                   network is used for detecting and                                               isolating potential faults.  The                                                adaptive critic is composed of                                                  three neural networks, a faulty                                                 system model, a performance                                                     optimizer (critic), and a                                                       classifier (action) which selects                                               and reports the time, location,                                                 magnitude, and nature of the                                                    faults.  The resulting diagnosis                                                procedure exhibits generic and                                                  therefore portable architecture.                                                In the presence of real-world                                                   operating conditions characterized                                              by noisy sensor and actuator                                                    measurements, as well as process                                                noise and drifts, the proposed                                                  approach would be capable of                                                    detecting, isolating, and                                                       accommodating system faults which                                               have not been encountered or                                                    anticipated during operation.  It                                               is anticipated that successful                                                  completion of the proposed project                                              will significantly impact the                                                   electric power industry, and                                                    complex, large-scale nonlinear                                                  systems in general.",
