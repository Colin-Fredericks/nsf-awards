This property is                                             sometimes referred to as                                                        hysteresis.  Design of devices and                                              systems is often complicated by the                                             presence of hysteresis because no                                               adequate analytical or computer                                                 tools are available to predict                                                  various physical parameters and                                                 properties in this case.  It is the                                             objective of this project to                                                    develop computational methods for                                               modeling of electromagnetic systems                                             with hysteresis.                                                                                                                                                The research will focus on the                                                  following two problems.  One is the                                             development and selection of                                                    mathematical models of hysteresis                                               which can accurately represent                                                  constitutive laws.  The other is                                                the development of computational                                                methods which can be used to                                                    determine electromagnetic fields on                                             the basis of Maxwell's equations                                                and constitutive laws.                                                                                                                                          Computational methods for                                                       electromagnetic field problems with                                             hysteresis have been addressed                                                  previously in the context of static                                             magnetic fields only.  It is the                                                goal here to improve the existing                                               methods of field computation in                                                 media with hysteresis and extend                                                them to problems involving electric                                             fields and eddy currents.  To this                                              end, a new, more general hysteresis                                             model will be used.  Finite element                                             techniques are also suggested for                                               these computations because powerful                                             tools for modeling of different                                                 geometries in the context of the                                                finite element method are readily                                               available.",
