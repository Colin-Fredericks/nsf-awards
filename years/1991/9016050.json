 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is research on certain aspects of modeling and                             control of dynamical systems.  In particular, an                                integrated approach to modeling and control of linear                           dynamical systems will be developed based on the                                notion of a graph.  The notion of a graph of a                                  dynamical system and the notion of the gap metric are                           important new ideas in systems theory.  The gap metric                          is a notion of distance between systems suitable for use                        in the context of robust stabilization and control.                             Approximation of models of linear dynamical systems                             can be done with use of the gap metric.  This is                                motivated by the need to synthesize controllers using                           \"low\" order models.  The description of the modeling                            error appears naturally in the form of uncertainty in                           the graph of a given system -- graph being the set of all                       bounded input-output pairs of the system.  The first                            part of the research will be on such modeling theory.                           In the second part of the research, a framework of                              modeling which uses estimates of the autocorrelation                            function of a given signal will be developed.  In                               particular, measuring noisy input-output data of an                             unknown linear system can be cast into this framework.                           An approach to recursive spectral estimation based on                          autocorrelation (covariance) data is proposed.  The gap                         metric will be used to obtain a-priori bounds on                                spectral estimates and on estimates of the uncertainty                          in the graph of the sought model.                                               The third part of the research will be to continue the                          development of recent results on a new approach to                              spectral factorization.  This is based on a sequence of                         transformations on the graph of a given linear system.                          The technique is based on an iterative scheme and                               holds the potential of leading to fast and efficient                            algorithms for spectral factorization and recursive                             filtering.",
