 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have proposed                       speciation models for herbivorous insects that make critical                    assumptions about genetics, behavior, and ecological interactions               with the host plants.  Testing these assumptions will lead to an                improved understanding of plant-herbivore interactions.  If these               assumptions are tested in populations that have recently                        diverged, or are in the process of diverging, these tests can                   help determine which of several competing models of speciation                  are most plausible.  Hypotheses about these assumptions will be                 tested in two populations of a gall-making herbivore on two                     closely related host plants.  These populations are of one                      morphological species and are partially reproductively isolated                 due to differences in host preference for mating and egg-laying.                Knowledge of genetic and other mechanisms responsible for these                 preferences are crucial to understanding how herbivore speciation               occurs.  These questions will be explored with a series of field,               experimental garden, and greenhouse experiments.  Results from                  crosses between the host-associated populations will be used to                 determine how host-and mating-site preferences and the ability to               survive different host plants is inherited.  Additional                         experiments will be conducted to determine how environment and                  experience influence oviposition-and mating-site preference.                    Studies will also be conducted to determine how natural selection               differs between host plants that could select for divergence of                 populations.  Finally, whether there is genetic variation within                one host-associated population could preadapt the behavioral for                a shift to a new host plant will be investigated.  Taken                        together, these data will provide insight into the ecology of                   plant-herbivore, interactions, the evolution of  host expansions,               speciation, as well as the specialized adaptations of                           agricultural pests.",
