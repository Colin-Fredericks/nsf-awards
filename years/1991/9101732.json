The aim of the research is to study the development                     of neuronal plasticity, including synaptic transmission and                     modulation of cell activity in chronically implanted, freely                    moving rats.  Results of these studies would add much to our                    understanding of a number of developmentally-dependent                          hippocampal processes related to learning and memory.                                                                                                           This award will help to maintain a successful research                          collaboration initiated over 10 years ago.  For this research,                  the Italian group will collect data from groups of 45 and 90                    day-old groups while the U.S. group will do the same for 15                     to 30 day groups.  The collaboration will expedite the                          exchange of scientific knowledge and will provide students                      with an opportunity to engage in an international research                      effort.",
