 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year effort of the UNC Mathematics and Science                       Education Network is a statewide plan for enhancing teacher                     education in the area of statistics.  Each of nine sites                        across the state will be involved.  The project focuses on                      teachers of grades one through six, and will establish a                        structure in the state for encouraging and supporting the                       teaching of statistics in those grades.  The project                            includes a series of seminars in statistics education for                       university and college faculty; the development of an                           initial cadre of principals and elementary school teachers                      who will participate in professional development programs                       and implement plans to teach statistics in their schools;                       and to spread the project through the state by preparing                        cadres of statistics educators (elementary teachers who                         have participated in the project) and supporting their                          efforts with local school systems.  The project includes a                      research effort, as well as a strong emphasis on the                            development of professional materials for teachers.  The                        project will be a complementary effort to the North                             Carolina Statewide Systemic Initiative, which is directed                       by the North Carolina Alliance for Mathematics and Science.                                                                                                     In the first year, teacher educators from the regional                          sites will participate in a planning seminar, and will                          select local teams of teachers and principals.  Each of the                     nine sites will select a six-person teams.  A summer                            institute will be held in 1992 at UNC Chapel Hill for the                       teacher members of the teams, and the faculty members from                      the nine sites.  Principals will attend for part of this                        time.  Implementation and regional meetings occur in the                        1992-93 academic year; during this year each site also                          selects 24 new participants.  In summer 1993, three-week                        summer institutes are held at the regional sites, with 24                       teachers at each site, conducted by the local teams.  The                       inservice materials developed in year one will serve as the                     foundation for these summer institutes.  In the 93-94 year,                     regional support and followup is the major activity, and in                     the summer of 1994 a special one-week institute for                             statistics educators will be implemented.  In addition,                         summer institutes will be offered regionally in 1994, of                        two-week and three-week duration, with local support.                                                                                                           Cost sharing is included as 67% of the NSF award.",
