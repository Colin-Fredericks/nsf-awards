A                    better understanding of the Chukotkan sequence is especially                    needed in the light of recent confirmation that western St.                     Lawrence Island was over-run by large glaciers that                             originated in the mountainous Chukchi Peninsula.  Adding                        interest is the fact that glaciomarine deposits of middle                       Pleistocene age are reported to be widespread on the Chukchi                    coast.  This award addresses these questions in a joint                         study with Soviet researchers intended to establish a new                       stratigraphic and geochronologic framework for regional late                    Cenozoic correlations.  Special attention will be given to                      the paleoclimate significance of the remarkable mid-                            Pleistocene event that evidently resulted in out-of-phase                       glaciation throughout central Beringia.  This project is                        proposed as a part of the  program for U.S. - U.S.S.R.                          Cooperation in the Field of Basic Research.",
