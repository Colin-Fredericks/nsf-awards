The                                    objective of this research is to perform a 3-                                   D study of reinforced concrete (R/C)                                            structures on the adverse effects of                                            nonproportional deformations on the inelastic                                   response of R/C members.  A finite element                                      model which includes an assemblage of                                           inelastic solid elements to model the                                           concrete and elastic-plastic bar elements                                       representing the reinforcing steel will be                                      used to study the complex interaction between                                   the axial and lateral deformations.                                                                                                                             As a case study, the response of ICS Building                                   during the Imperial Valley Earthquake of Oct.                                   15, 1979 will be evaluated.  Further                                            parametric study at the elements level will                                     be also performed to advance the knowledge                                      and to satisfy the need for detailed                                            information on the force-displacement                                           response of R/C columns under uncoupled                                         fluctuation of axial and lateral loads.  The                                    results of this project are expected to                                         improve the understanding of the cyclic                                         behavior of R/C structures and members, and                                     to impact the seismic design practices of R/C                                   structures.",
