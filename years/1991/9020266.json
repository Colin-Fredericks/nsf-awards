 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last several years have seen a great expansion and                          diversification of research directions and approaches in machine                learning, and a simultaneous interest in developing systems that                integrate various learning strategies.  Such a situation creates                a need for analyzing and clarifying the relationships among                     different strategies and approaches, and building a theoretical                 basis for the implementation of multistrategy learning systems.                 This research attempts to develop a theoretical framework for                   describing diverse learning processes, based on a general notion                of inference (hence, inference-based theory).  According to this                theory, a system learns from input information by trying to                     understand it i.e., to relate it to its background knowledge                    (BK).  Based on this theory the researcher plans to develop a                   multistrategy task-adaptive learning (MTL) system, that                         synergistically integrates different learning strategies.  Given                an input and a goal of learning, an MTL learner applies the                     strategies) that are most appropriate according to the                          relationship between the input and learner's BK in the context of               the learner's goal.  The MTL methodology is intended to integrate               ultimately such learning strategies as empirical learning,                      constructive induction, explanation-based learning, abduction,                  learning by analogy and abstraction.",
