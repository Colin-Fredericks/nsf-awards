 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Emory               University for the renovation and repair of the Psychology                      Building which will as a result be able to house that                           institution's research and research training activities in                      cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and psychobiology.              This building was constructed in 1951 and has not been renovated                since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $700,000 and $857,595 provided             by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these                  research and research training facilities and contribute to the                 consolidation of the entire psychology faculty in one building for              the first time.  This project will address the need to improve the              current research infrastructure both in terms of health and safety              and of the quantity and quality of research that can be carried out             by upgrading the plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air                        conditioning (HVAC), and lighting; and by reconfiguring the                     partitioning of space including the provision of rooms with                     acoustical insulation and other features that make them suitable                for modern research in psychology.                                                                                                                              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students by              a distinguished, nationally recognized faculty.  Students trained               in these laboratories will be able to maintain high standards in                the conduct of psychological research.",
