This award will support a 12-month postdoctoral research                        visit by Dr. D.J. Petersen with Professor Jos Vanderleyden                      of the F.A. Janssenslaboratorium voor Genetics, Katholieke                      Universiteit Leuven \u0131Louvaine!, Belgium.  Thanks to biotech-                    nology, which now can dramatically change the metabolic                         character of micro\u001arganisms, the anaerobic organism                             Clostridium acetobutylicum is used commercially to produce                      important organic solvents because it can convert a wide                        variety of crude substrates to acids and alcohols in high                       yield.  New knowledge concerning the molecular genetics and                     cell regulation of C. acetobutylicum allows unprecedented                       genetic manipulation of fermentations of this organism.  Dr.                    Petersen proposes to produce beneficial genetic alterations                     of the cell metabolism by the introduction and amplification                    of modified genes to (1) elucidate the regulatory factor(s)                     controlling the metabolic switch from acid to solvent                           production; (2) produce specific alterations to place                           expression of genes involved in solvent production under                        regulatory controls independent of cell cycle, including                        site-specific mutagenesis and recombination with altered                        genes; (3) identify the solvent induction signal, facilitated                   by Tn916 mutants already achieved in his laboratory; 4)                         analyze transcription regulation with the newly developed                       ELISA system which increases sensitivity and reproductibility                   while circumventing problems inherent in anaerobic \u001a-                           galactosidase assays using C. acetobutylicum; 5) incorporate                    anti-sense RNA technology also developed by Dr. Vanderleyden                    in the bioreactor studies of gene regulations in genetically                    altered strains; 6) evaluate cells metabolically with                           altered enzymatic pathways to assess the effectiveness of                       recombinant proteins in biocatalysis and observe the effects                    on the levels of other enzymes; 7) study research developments                  at Leuven in gene transfer technology with other model                          systems such as Azospirillum and Rhizobia.
