 "awd_abstract_narration": "The single cells of Phycomyces blakesleeanus have been studied               by many scientists during the past four decades.  These large plant             cells, which can grow up to twenty centimeters in length, can                   detect and respond to many different environmental and sensory                  stimuli (such as light, gravity, mechanical stretching, and wind)               with a change in growth rate (which is relatively easy to measure).             Some scientists hope that these studies will provide a better                   understanding of how the environmental and sensory stimuli are                  processed by the cell (sensory transduction), and how the plant                 cell regulates its growth rate.  The goal of the present work is                to establish equations which describe the growth rate of these                  plant cells, so that a more detailed, comprehensive, and                        quantitative understanding of growth rate regulation is obtained.               These equations may also provide the framework by which the                     biochemical events, which occur in sensory transduction, may be                 related to the measurable changes in the growth rate of the plant               cell.",
