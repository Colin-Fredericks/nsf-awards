This research                    seeks to help clarify the relationships of sub-Saharan                          populations through the analysis of dental traits.  As many                     recent theories postualte a recent, African origin for our                      species, clarification of population relationships on this                      continent are a key aspect of resolving the larger question.                                                                                                    Lately, much research has utilized nucleic acid technology to                   seek answers to these questions, but not without challenge.  For                instance, some of the results appear to be at odds with                         archaeological evidence.  The dentition evidences a number of                   independent, genetic traits which can be used to help clarig=fy                 population relationships.  To date, however, the dental                         anthropology of African poulations has been minimal.  The                       proposed study will involve the scoring of a sizable number of                  human, African dentitions which are housed in several museums.  A               number of computer algorithms can be used to assess similarities                between populations, both within Africa and in contrast to non-                 African groups for which data already exists.                                   By such techniques a clearer picture of human movements and                     evolution should emerge.",
