 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the first project, \"Torsion Invariants and Algebraic K-                 theory of von Neumann Algebras\", a new topological invariant is                 defined for a Riemannian manifold with a proper cocompact action                ofa countable discrete group G by isometries.  It generalizes                   classical notions of Reidemeister torsion.  One goal is to find a               better understanding of the weak K-theory of the von Neumann                    algebra of G, where the invariant lives.  The principal                         investigator wants to show by computation that the invariant                    carries a lot of information in interesting cases, including                    homology 3-spheres, hyperbolic manifolds, crystallographic                      manifolds and symmetric spaces.  Another problem is to give an                  analytic interpretation in terms of the spectral theory of the                  Laplace operator.                                                                    The other project, \"Surgery Transfer and a General Signature               Formula for Fibre Bundles,\" is devoted to the study of the                      surgery transfer of a fibre bundle of manifolds.  An algebraic                  description was developed by the principal investigator and                     Andrew Ranicki.  It will be used to make explicit calculations,                 to prove vanishing results, which have geometric meaning and                    applications, and to establish a general signature formula for                  fibre bundles.                                                                       The first project is a joint project together with Professor               Melvin Rothenberg of the University of Chicago, the second with                 Professor Andrew Ranicki of the University of Edinburgh.  Both                  combine topology, analysis, and algebra in genuine synthesis.                   Their principal value may be generating new tools for                           understanding manifolds and their symmetries.  Manifolds are, of                course, very basic geometric objects and arise almost everywhere                one looks in mathematics and physics, often as solutions of                     systems of ordinary or differential equations.",
