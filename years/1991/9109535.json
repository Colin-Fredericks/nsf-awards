 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative proposal explores the effects of replacing                   standard probabilities or chance lotteries by uncertain beliefs in              the definition of the prospects.  The comparison of attitudes                   about prospects in which outcomes are determined by chance or                   by the decision maker's knowledge will provide information about                the role of personal responsibility in choice.  Second the project              investigates cumulative decision making, that is, a series of                   choices in which outcomes accumulate in the course of the session.              A new experimental paradigm will be developed and                               applied to study effects of the amount at stake, mental accounting,             previous success and failures and other issues, in the context of               cumulative decision making.  By introducing genuine uncertainty and             multiple decisions, as well as learning and feedback, this project              aims to bring decision research closer to the actual practice of                decisions, which typically innvolve unquantified uncertainty and                are generally made in the context of other decisions.",
