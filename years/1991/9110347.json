 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective is to study how good or bad distributed simulation is             for the simulation of a few specific systems; these systems are                 queuing networks, timed petri nets, and logic circuits.  Regarding              queuing networks and logic circuits, the performance of three well              known distributed simulation schemes will be studied.  Regarding timed          petri nets, new distributed simulation algorithms will be developed             and their performance studied.                                                                                                                                  This approach aims to answer several questions that have remained               unanswered previously - relationship between overhead and performance,          ideal speedups that one can expect, and relationship between the                simulator parameters (such as delays on communication lines) and                performance.  The essential elements of the approach are (i) simulate           the distributed simulator instead of directly implementing it on a              machine, which makes it easy to vary parameters such as communication           delays, computation times etc.  (ii) study the relationship between             overhead and performance by varying computation and communication               times for overhead messages, and (iii) define and measure certain               notions of ideal speedup that are more realistic than simply the                number of processors.                                                                                                                                           The immediate benefit of this research would be to provide a better             understanding of several performance issues, e.g., what is the cause            of low performance -- too many overhead messages or lack of potential           parallelism in the system?  It is commonly believed that overhead is            the main problem.  This is not true in many cases.  In the long term            this will lead to high performance distributed simulators custom                designed for specific classes of systems.",
