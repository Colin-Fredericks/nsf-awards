 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software maintenance is the process of designing and integrating                consistent changes to an existing software system.  Doing effective             maintenance is a complex task due in part to the size and complexity            of the maintained software, and the widely varying maintenance support          tools and environments that are available.  These problems are                  compounded since most existing software produced prior to the use of            structured techniques.  It is difficult for the maintainer to                   ascertain the complete effect of a code change.  Decomposition                  slicing yields guidelines for maintainers to use so that changes can            be assured to be completely contained in the components under                   consideration and that there are no undetected linkages between the             modified and unmodified code.  Thus the impact of changes can be                assessed.  The decomposition can also be used to limit the amount of            testing required to assure that the change is correct.  The goal of             this research is to scale up this methodology and validate its                  effectiveness on large software systems by an empirical evaluation.",
