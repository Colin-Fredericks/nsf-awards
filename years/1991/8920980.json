 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, magnetic fields are used to break emulsions                    of water in oil.  Typically, water-in-oil emulsions are mixed                   with aqueous solutions containing magnetic additives.  The                      resulting water-in-oil emulsions contain magnetic droplets                      which can be polarized by low-level magnetic fields.  It has                    been shown in Phase I of this work that the polarized droplets                                                                                                  orient and aggregate in drop-strings.  These aggregated drops                   can subsequently be removed more easily by settling.  Thus,                     with low residence time and low energy consumption, emulsions                   can be broken and drier oils can be produced.  The fundamental                                                                                                  aspects of viscous, interfacial, and magnetic forces affecting                                                                                                  the above processes are studied.  A continuously operated pre-                                                                                                  pilot bench-scale unit will be built and used to demonstrate                    the process on a larger scale than previously.  The results                     will be used to help evaluate the commercial feasibility of                     the process and help evaluate additives and process                             parameters.",
