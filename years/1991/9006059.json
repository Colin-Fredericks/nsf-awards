 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data structures to accommodate fast retrieval are perhaps the              oldest and certainly one of the most fundamental topics in computer             science.  This project addresses several open problems of both                  pragmatic and theoretical interest.                                                  The first group of open questions concerns worst-case algorithms           that outperform the information theoretical lower bound.  Recently an           O(log N/log log N) worst-case time algorithm for dynamic tree                   operations and an accompanying O(N log N/log log N) worst-case time             sorting algorithm have been designed.  Both algorithms run on                   essentially all digital computers and on all possible data inputs.              The new approach to sorting and searching rests on utilizing the power          of a digital computer's arithmetic and bitwise logical operations.              Numerous open questions arise about what upper and lower bounds for             sorting, searching, balance tree operations, and hashing can be                 demonstrated in this modified mathematical model.                                    A second research area focuses on computational geometry.  Many            geometric problems, such as Voronoi diagram construction,  have been            thought to require at least N log N time because of their reduction             to sorting procedures, but all such theoretical lower bounds need to            be reconsidered in light of the recent results for sorting and                  searching.  There are also several open questions raised by earlier             research into  range query theory.  One particular question concerns            developing lower bounds that take into account the presence of                  subtraction, and a second concerns the time-space tradeoff for                  especially reporting queries.                                                        Range query algorithms for batch queries, especially procedures            for executing relational calculus and SETL-like expressions, will also          be studied.",
