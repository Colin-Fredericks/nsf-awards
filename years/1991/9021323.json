James Hartnett (University of Illinois,                       Chicago) and Raymond Viskanta (Purdue University) on                            behalf of the Midwest Universities Energy Consortium,                           and Dr. Oleg Martynenko of the Luikov Institute of Heat                         and Mass Transfer, Minsk.  The primary objective of the                         workshop is to identify opportunities for scientifically                        promising collaborative research partnerships of mutual                         benefit involving U.S. and Soviet investigators and to                          prepare proposals for long-term cooperative research                            projects for submission and competitive review.                                                                                                                 Multiphase flow problems are of vital concern to a broad                        range of industries, including petroleum and gas                                production, power generation, chemicals, and others.                            However, our understanding of the basic principles and                          behavior of these systems is quite limited, potentially                         leading to failures of process design, safety hazards,                          and limited economic benefit.  The complementary                                expertise and capabilities of the U.S. and Soviet                               research efforts in this field are expected to contribute                       toward improved understanding of these processes.                                                                                                               This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine comple-                           mentary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                             mutual interest and competence in the field of basic                            scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,                      and mutuality of benefit.",
