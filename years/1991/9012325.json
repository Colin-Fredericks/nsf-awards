 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Public Affairs Video Archives at Purdue University includes                 many congressional hearings and public policy conferences which                 involve science and technology, scientists and engineers.  Funds                for this project will enable the Archives to develop several edited             videos, video series and teaching guides to facilitate and                      encourage the use of these programs for the study of ethics, values             and policy development involving science and technology.  A recent              graduate will work with university students and faculty to develop              these materials and test them in classrooms.  Advisors will assist              in the development of ethics components.                                                                                                                        The topic of this proposal is of highest priority for Ethics and                Values Studies.  The qualifications and track record of the                     investigators and organization are excellent.  The project provides             a cost-effective test of the feasibility of developing edited video             programming on social and ethical concerns associated with science              and technology for classroom use.  Results will be useful for a                 wide range of individuals and groups.  The budget is very modest.               The proposal is recommended for support.",
