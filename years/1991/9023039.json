 "awd_abstract_narration": "The past twenty years have witnessed explosive advances in molecular            biology and molecular genetics.  Prime examples are the discovery of            oncogenes and the construction of transgenic mammals.  As a consequence         many now believe that the basic biological disciplines have begun to            unravel the mysteries of the causes and evolution of cancer.  The same          period has witnessed accelerating use of cancer risk assessments by             government and industry officials responsible for the protection of             the public health from potentially carcinogenic chemicals.  Great               disparity exists in technical and scientific sophistication between             the cancer risk assessment methods currently in use and methods                 potentially available as a result of oncogene and transgenics                   research.  This award provides partial funding for an International             5-day Advanced Research Workshop (ARW), funded principally by the               Scientific Affairs Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization          (NATO).  It will be held in the Hotel Meliton, Sithonia, Halkidiki,             Greece from April 28, till May 3, 1991, to explore recent advances in           oncogene and transgenics research for potential short and long term             contributions toward the improvement of cancer risk assessment methods          currently in use by public health protection authorities in the                 industrialized world.",
