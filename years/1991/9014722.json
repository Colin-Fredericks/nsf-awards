 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project is for support of seven                              U.S. scientists to participate in a U.S.-Pakistan                               Symposium and Workshop in Islamabad, Pakistan, in June                          1991 on Silicon Technology.  The Pakistani                                      Co-Chairperson is Dr. Atique Mufti, Director, National                          Institute of Silicon Technology in Islamabad.  The                              objectives are to disseminate recently acquired                                 information and experiences in the utilization of                               silicon in Photovoltaics as well as electronic                                  applications in the last four years, to discuss                                 relevant applications in Less Developed Countries                               (LDC's) and to identify areas for possible joint                                research.  The seminar will cover: status of silicon                            technology, including technical breakthroughs, and                              economic constraints.  The technical lectures will                              cover production procedures of silicon from various                             raw materials, growth of single crystal and float zone                          technology; status of amorphous silicon technology and                          its future; polycrystalline casting and ribbon                                  technology, manufacturing of silicon chips, materials                           and techniques for making thin film solar cells,                                heterojunctions, concentrations and hybrids; status of                          storage devices; and design of solar systems.  The                              final day will be devoted to workshops to identify the                          most effective means of technology transfer, and to                             facilitate the development of S.I. industry, and to                             identify areas for joint research.                                                                                                                              Scope:  This meeting will follow one that was held                              four years earlier which helped Pakistan in its                                 emerging silicon technology research and applications                           in solar energy storage and utilization.  The meeting                           will be attended by scientists from several countries                           in South Asia and the Middle East.  It should help                              foster the interest in the research and development                             that support the use of solar energy in that region.",
