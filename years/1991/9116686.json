 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Barbara Mills will                conduct an analysis of two Zuni pottery samples.  One derives                   from complete vessels collected from living individuals in the                  19th and early 20th centuries.  The other comes from                            archaeological materials excavated from known Zuni sites which                  were occupied from the 15th to 17th centuries A.D.  The goal of                 the study is to use the ethnographic samples as a control and on                this basis, reconstruct both pottery making and social                          organization during the earlier period.  Dr. Mills will focus on                both shape and size of vessels as well as the raw materials from                which they are constructed.  In particular, she is concerned with               degrees of standardization since this can be taken as an indirect               measure of social organization.  She will analyze raw material                  through use of Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis,                        Inductively-Coupled Plasma Emission Spectroscopy and electron                   microprobe analysis.  The degree of standardization in raw                      material preparation will be determined through visual imaging                  techniques.                                                                                                                                                     Careful ethnographic studies in the United States began in the                  late 1800's and much first hand data are available for groups                   like the Zuni from that period.  However, it is uncertain how                   stable native American social organization is over time, given                  increasing influence of European contact.  For anthropologists,                 this poses a major problem since 19th and 20th century models are               usually (and with doubtful validity) extended back in time.  Dr.                Mills postulates that organization of ceramic manufacture                       reflects societal organization: especially degree of authority                  centralization.  Through analysis of well controlled ethnographic               and archaeological pottery samples, she will be able to examine                 social change through time.                                                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons.  It will increase               our understanding of native American history and prehistory.  It                will also serve to develop techniques which will be of                          anthropological use in many parts of the world.",
