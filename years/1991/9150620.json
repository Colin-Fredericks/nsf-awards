Faculty from ten universities come                        together with individuals who have successfully delivered                       orientation courses to minority engineering students and other                  orientation course experts to develop a model curriculum and                    text material for the proposed course.  Each of the faculty                     participants  teach this course at their institution to a                       randomly selected group of engineering first-year students, and                 the academic performance and freshman-to-sophomore retention of                 those students is compared to that of the non-participating                     control group.  A disssemination conference involving the                       participating faculty and several California community college                  engineering faculty is held as a finale to the project.",
