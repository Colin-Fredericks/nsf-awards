 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research on the topic                     of semiconductor microstructures. The US investigators are                      Dr. Arto Nurmikko and Dr.Phillip Stiles, Brown University,                      and Dr. Bennet Goldberg, Boston University.  The Austrian                       collaborator is Professor Gunther Bauer, Institut fur Physik,                   University of Linz, Austria.  The goal of the project is to                     explore novel semiconductor microstructures, based on Narrow                    bandgap IV-VI compounds.  A range of sophisticated experimental                 studies are proposed, with emphasis on lower dimensional                        electronic phenomena in quantizing magnetic fields.                                                                                                             Specifically, compositional and doping superlattices, hetero-                   junctions and other microstructures of column four and column                   six elements will be grown, fabricated and studied by optical                   and transport experimental probes.  The emphasis on PbTe-                       based systems is due to the inherent high carrier mobilities,                   ease of doping, and large dielectric constant unavailable in                    other materials.  The study will concentrate on determining                     the unusual many body properties of systems when the Coulomb                    energy between carriers is of the same order of magnitude as                    the kinetic energy. They will also examine the reduced                          dimensional aspects of this interaction, by creating                            compositional and doping heterojunctions which confine the                      carriers in two dimensions.  The experimental tools to be                       applied are magneto-transport, interband and intraband                          magneto-optics, and transient optical probes.  Samples will be                  grown in Austria and patterned at Boston University and                         Brown University. The project will benefit from the                             complementary expertise of the US and Austrian investigators                    and their past history of successful collaboration.",
