 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work combines studies of a recently reported, high activity                 catalyst with experiments designed to induce the olefin                         polymerization step to occur at a measurable rate under vacuum                  conditions.    The latter approach will overcome the normal                     enthalpic and entropic barriers that normally constrain                         polymerization processes to high pressures by performing two                    types of experiment.  In the first experiment supersonic                        molecular beams of energetic monomers will be used to surmount                  energetic barriers.  In the second experiment the monomer will                  be tethered to the surface to create a high local concentration                 of reactants at the active site so that the reaction may                        efficiently proceed.  The studies will use a quartz crystal                     microbalance to measure polymerization kinetics in situ, and a                  combination of Auger electron spectroscopy, high resolution                     electron energy loss spectroscopy and mass spectrometery to                     investigate the surface processes.                                                                                                                              %%%                                                                                                                                                             The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                     Chemistry, focuses on a study of various new approaches for                     examining the mechanism of surface-catalyzed olefin                             polymerization using a variety of surface science techniques to                 investigate the surface processes.  The work promises to                        provide new understanding of an important industrial catalytic                  process,and have significance in the area of polymer thin films                 for microelectronic packaging applications.",
