 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the investigation of new                          approaches for the design and production of catalytic                           antibodies. In general, antibodies raised to compounds that                     resemble transition states of a desired reaction are expected                   to use binding forces to lower the energy of a real transition                  state in the analogous chemical transformation. Catalytic rate                  enhancements as high as one million-fold over background have                   been observed using this strategy. Exquisite substrate                          specificity, including stereospecificity when appropriate, is                   always observed, and this specificity can be programmed into                    the antibody by the structure of the original immunizing                        haptens. There are three major projects, all designed to                        exploit this programmable specificity of catalytic antibodies.                  In each case, standard hybridoma techniques for production of                   monoclonal antibodies in mice enhanced by new molecular biology                 methods will be used. The first project will probe the use of                   catalytic antibodies to manipulate chemical protecting groups                   during organic synthesis. The second project involves testing                   the utility of metal cofactors in antibody catalyzed reactions.                 The third project seeks to generate an antibody-based system                    that can reproduce some of the essential features of                            photosynthesis.                                                                 %%%                                                                             With this Presidential Young Investigator Award, the Synthetic                  Organic Program of the Chemistry Division will support the                      research of Dr. Brent Iverson of the Department of Chemistry                    and Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin on                        catalytic antibodies. These antibodies, produced by challenging                 the immune systems of mice with compounds that resemble high                    energy or transition states of desired reactions, frequently                    are capable of providing catalytic rate enhancements as high as                 one million-fold. Thus these antibodies resemble enzymes in                     being catalytic proteins, but function to catalyze reactions                    for which no enzymes exist.",
