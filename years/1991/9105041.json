 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fan-shaped features (fans) in the southern Blue Ridge province             are essentially mantled pediments.  The mantles, ranging in                     thickness from 1 to 30 m, consist of diamictons (probably debris                flows) and alluvium, and commonly is separated from underlying                  metamorphic bedrock by a layer of saprolite.  Rather than the                   depositional mechanisms that have been the focus of previous                    studies of Blue Ridge fans, the thrust of this study is to                      understand these landforms in the light of previous research on                 pediments in arid and semiarid regions.  Fans in five areas will                be mapped using aerial photographs and soil properties to delineate             terraces of different ages; standard soil-development indices will              be used to estimate ages of the terraces.  Seismic refraction and               reflection as well as drilling will be used to determine sediment               and saprolite thickness and subsurface relief on terraces of                    different ages.  In order to ascertain factors necessary for fan                formation, areas with fans will be compared with other areas in the             Blue Ridge lacking fans with respect to piedmont and basin                      morphometry, lithology, soils, and maximum clast size.  A                       hypothesis to be tested is that fans occur only where uplands occur             only where uplands supply great numbers of large boulders to the                mountain piedmont.",
