 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support research on the mathematics of                          disordered systems to be conducted by Abel Klein of the                         University of California at Irvine in cooperation with J.                       Fernando Perez and Henrique von Dreifus from the University                     of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  They will investigate phenomena in                       two types of disordered systems:  quantum spin systems with                     disorder and random Schrodinger operators.  Quantum spin                        systems with random parameters have been introduced to study                    the effect of impurities in several physical systems.                           Examples of such systems are given by quantum X - Y, Heisenberg                 and Ising models in the presence of a random transverse                         field.  These models are related to superfluidity and                           superconductivity.                                                                                                                                              The study of disordered quantum systems that exhibit zero-                      temperature transitions is a new and exciting area of                           research in Mathematical Physics.  In such models, one has to                   treat the combined effects of randomness and quantum                            fluctuations.  Such combination has hardly been studied in                      the Physics literature or in Mathematical Physics.  Such study                  is a long range goal of this research proposal.",
