 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research has the objectives of formulating and validating                  theory-based principles for the visual representation of higher                 dimensional scientific data.  Two theoretical perspectives are                  joined in this work.  One addresses the similar characteristics                 of the display of two or more data points that facilitate their                 cognitive integration, but disrupts the focussing of attention on               single data points.  This perspective emphasizes the similarity                 induced by contours and color.  The second addresses biases and                 characteristics of depth perception.  Subjects view                             multidimensional data bases on a workstation that characterize                  the constraints between dimensional values in different                         scientific domains (e.g., meteorology, electrophysiology,                       economics), in various static and dynamic, color and monochrome,                3D formats that allow test of the hypotheses.  They answer a                    range of questions of the displayed data, and the speed and                     accuracy of the response is used to evaluate graphical formats.                 While a wealth of display technology is now available for                       scientific visualizaiton, there are very few empirical                          validations of the techniques offered, and those are not                        described within the framework of general principles of human                   perception and cognition, in a way to generalize to other                       applications.  This research will advance knowledge by providing                such generalization.",
