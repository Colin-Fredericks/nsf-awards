Light polarization and fluorescence lifetime can both be                        related to the speed and extent of reaction. Among the systems                  to be characterized are antibody-antigen interactions in                        immunochemical methods of analysis, solubilization of molecules                 in organized media, and interactions between chiral solutes and                 chromatographic phases in enantiomeric separations.                             %%%                                                                             This research is concerned with the interactions of guest                       molecules with the molecular components of host cavities.  Of                   particular interest are the effects of the shapes of the guests                 and of the host cavities on these interactions. Chiral and                      achiral hosts and chiral and achiral guests will be studied                     using a new technique called \"time-resolved                                     fluorescence-detected circular dichroism.\"  The results will be                 applicable to chromatomatographic separations of chiral                         molecules and to a better understanding of the kinetics of                      biochemical reactions and of antibody-antigen interactions.",
