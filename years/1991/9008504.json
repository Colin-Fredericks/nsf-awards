 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each of the billions of cell of an animal contains a kind of genetic            encyclopedia of DNA which contains in small stories, or genes, the              information required to make the proteins which compose that cell.              What distinguishes one cell from another is how each cell reads a set           of instructions before each of these information units (called genes),          and uses those instructions to decide whether or not to make copy of            the unit of information.  These copies provide the instructions to tell         cells to make the proteins which distinguish say a skin cell from a             liver cell.  Until our studies it was generally thought that the                lifetime of each copy of an information unit in the cell was fixed.             Dr. Shapiro showed that the hormone estrogen both causes the cells to           copy the information units involved in the production of egg proteins           and greatly increases the time the copies are present in the cell               before being scrapped and destroyed.  Since only copies of the                  information involved in egg protein production are made more stable by          estrogen, a large part of our work is devoted to identifying the                instructions on the copies which tell the cell to make them stable              when estrogen is present.  In recent work he developed a system for             testing which parts of the copy are important in making them more               stable, and showed that the information used to make the protein does           not control the lifespan of the copy.  The present proposal aims to             identify more precisely the instructions in the copy which tell the             cell this copy is subject to stabilization by estrogen.  He will also           begin studies aimed at identifying the cell proteins which read this            information.  Finally the mechanism by which cells sense the presence           of estrogen and communicate this information to the places in the cell          where the copies reside will be identified.                                                                                                                     Regulation of the lifespan of copies of genetic information has emerged         as common control mechanism by hormones.  Faulty regulation of the              lifespan of copies has also been shown to be important in several               common types of cancer.  However, little is known about how the                 lifespan of copies of genetic information is controlled.  The estrogen-         mediated increase in the stability of copies of genetic information             encoding egg proteins provides one of the best opportunities to learn           how this important process is controlled in many systems.",
