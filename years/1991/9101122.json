 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will enable the American Association for the Advancement             of Science to confront one area in the impending crisis in the                  science and engineering workforce through a long-term project to                explore barriers for students with disabilities in engineering                  education.  The project will work with deans and faculties of                   schools of engineering to develop strategies for recruitment and                retention and to identify assistive technology and other support                services that give easier access to the educational process.  Six               schools of engineering will be selected as sites for model projects             in recruitment and retention of students with disabilities.  A                  parallel effort will assess methods of date collection on disabled              students and develop survey questions that can be directed at                   engineering schools.  Successful strategies will be disseminated                through a variety of networks.   At the end of the five year                    project, it is anticipated that many of the strategies will be                  institutionalized in schools of engineering and, data on retention              of students with disabilities will be included in all human                     resources studies.",
