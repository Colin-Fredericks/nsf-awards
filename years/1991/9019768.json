 "awd_abstract_narration": "Progress in the field of knowledge-based programming has been held up           because of the tremendous investment needed to build an experimental            testbed.  The objective of this project is to provide an open research          system to other investigators by preparing the Kestrel Interactive              Development System (KIDS) for distribution to educational and research          institutions and to provide ongoing maintenance and support to off-             site users.  KIDS is a knowledge-based system that supports the                 development of correct and efficient programs from formal                       specifications.  KIDS' features include formal specifications, highly           automated support for correctness-preserving program transformations,           ease of use through a point-and-click-style graphic interface, and              representations for a wide varity of programming knowledge.  The                system has components for performing algorithm design, deductive                inference, program simplificaiton, partial evaluation, finite                   differencing optimizations, data type refinement and other development          operations.  Generally KIDS can be viewed as a system for performing            semantics-preserving transformations on complex linguistically-                 expressed objects.",
