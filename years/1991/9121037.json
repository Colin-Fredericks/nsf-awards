Benefits to the academic and social                   science research communities and NSF will accrue through                        formulation of new and innovative research topics, research                     results, and an improvement in the approach to assuring quality in              science and engineering data, including all areas related to                    post-survey analysis and validation, such as design of nonresponse              studies; analysis of response patterns in longitudinal surveys;                 analysis of item nonresponse patterns; and validation improvement               and survey research.",
