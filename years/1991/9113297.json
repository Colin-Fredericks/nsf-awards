 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fiber reinforced organic matrix composites are being used                     or proposed as primary and secondary structures for numerous                    military and commercial applications.  The presence of flaws                    and residual stresses in these composites are often caused                      by the fabrication and/or installation process.  Moreover,                      the structural behavior of these advanced materials is known                    to be affected by in-service environmental conditions                           (humidity, temperature, pressure, impact, etc.).  These                         conditions induce residual stresses and microcracking in the                    composite, and can irreversibly degrade the fiber/matrix                        interface.                                                                        The proposed research is designed to develop and demonstrate                  a novel automated NDE technique, laser speckle shearing                         interferometry, capable of rapidly determining the residual                     stresses and locating flaws in composites.  By allowing                         fundamental real-time measurements to be made in situ, the                      development of engineering models can be attained, and thus                     will contribute to improved basic studies of composite                          materials under various operational conditions.  The                            technique is viable and suitable for operation in a                             manufacturing environment or dept/repair facility and in the                    field.  Two minority undergraduate students and one graduate                    student of engineering will assist the principal                                investigator in the proposed research.",
