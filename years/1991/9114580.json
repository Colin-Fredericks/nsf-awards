 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this U.S.-Yugoslav workshop in earthquake                      engineering between Helmut Krawinkler of Stanford University and                Peter Fajfar of the University of Ljubljana is to identify                      cooperative research projects on nonlinear seismic analysis of                  reinforced concrete buildings.  The main topics for study are                   mathematical modeling of earthquake-resistant structured walls and              energy response in aseismic analysis and design of buildings.  The              workshop will also address repair and strengthening of existing                 structures and buildings.  A total of ten U.S. scientists from                  universities and the National Institute for Standards and Technology            and 10 Yugoslav scientists from 6 Yugoslav republics will                       participate.                                                                                                                                                    This project is supported by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology through a joint fund                      consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav                 governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the                 Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.",
