 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a continuation of experimental and                      theoretical studies of photosynthetic bacterial reaction                        centers.  Reaction centers are pigment-protein complexes that                   carry out the photochemical electron-transfer reactions plants                  and photosynthetic bacteria use to capture the energy of                        sunlight.                                                                       In the experimental work, reaction centers from several species                 of purple photosynthetic bacteria will be excited with flashes                  of light.  Transient states created by the excitation will be                   probed by measuring the optical absorption spectrum and                         stimulated emission with a second pulse of light at various                     times after the excitation.  These studies will focus on the                    rate and temperature dependence of the initial electron-                        transfer steps in reaction centers that have been modified by                   directed mutagenesis.  Amino acid substitutions that are likely                 to alter the energies of various radical-pair states will be                    chosen on the basis of theoretical calculations.  The transient                 states formed by excitation of reaction centers in which the                    initial electron acceptor is already reduced or the donor                       already oxidized will also be examined.                                         The theoretical studies will include calculations of the free                   energies of radical-pair states in native and mutant reaction                   centers, starting with the crystal structures of the native                     proteins and using a microscopic treatment of dielectric                        effects.  Time-dependent fluctuations of these energies will                    be examined by molecular-dynamics simulations, and will be                      reacted to the kinetics of the electron-transfer reactions.                     The goal of this work is to understand how the structure of the                 protein determines the mechanism, kinetics, and temperature                     dependence of the first two electron-transfer steps in the                      photosynthetic process.",
