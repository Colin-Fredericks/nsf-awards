 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research equipment effort is to support              a broad, aggressive research program in sensor-based robotics and               automation.  Purchase of a laser range scanner and a robot arm will             support several research projects, including:  sensor data fusion,              object recognition, sensor-based reasoning in controlled and                    uncontrolled environments, and combined manipulation and mobility.              This research methodology is firmly grounded in theory.  Results                from elimination theory provide a general basis for relating sensor             observations to geometric models of curved objects.  Constraint                 solving systems are used to recover the parameters of these and                 other parametric models.  Decision theory provides a framework for              developing task-directed sensor control and data processing                     algorithms.  The solution techniques advance two computational                  models, specifically symbolic equation rewriting and interval-based             constraint solving.  To validate these theoretical advances, they               must be tested under realistic conditions.  Range sensing,                      providing a direct source of real-world geometry, and a robot arm,              providing sensor mobility and object manipulation capabilities,                 will be employed to support the endeavors.                                           This equipment will provide the nucleus of a laboratory                    devoted to the construction of integrated automated systems with                the potential for a broad range of future applications.",
