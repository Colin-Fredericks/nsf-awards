 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the topic of fault diagnosis of mechanical               systems.  Unexpected machinery breakdown can lead to lost                       production, expensive repair work, and safety problems.  The two                traditional methods of maintainance involve either letting                      machines run to breakdown or scheduling repairs at predetermined                intervals.  An alternative is to monitor machine condition in                   process, and implement repairs only when necessary.  The research               focuses on this fault diagnosis approach and attempts to cope                   with fault signature variability, the main source of difficulty                 for existing diagnostic systems.  In the proposed method, multi                 valued influence matrix (MVIM), diagnostic signals are monitored                on line, and flagged upon the detection of an abnormality.  The                 method offers a methodical approach to diagnostic reasoning which               is suited to on line application and also establishes a framework               to select and optimize diagnostic sensors.  Two diagnostic                      problems, tool breakage in machining and fault diagnosis of                     helicopter power trains will be used to test the MVIM method.",
