 "awd_abstract_narration": "The architecture of the cerebral cortex of the brain shows                      sophisticated connections among and between the layers of nerve                 cells, and within and between functional units called columns.                  Nerve cells have very high metabolic rates, and blood flow to                   different areas of the brain depends on which parts are most                    active at particular times.  Blood flow is altered by regional                  changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide content, as well as by blood               pressure.  It is known that vascular capillary networks show flow               changes with regional, cyclic activity of opening and closing.                  The opening of a capillary network to a local region is called                  recruitment, and provides local cycling of nutrients (such as                   oxygen) and waste metabolites to active biological tissues.                                                                                                     This work uses a unique approach to combine the concepts of                     temporal cycling, capillary recruitment, columnar organization of               the cortex, and vascular architecture of the cortex.  There are                 suggestions that the recruitment cycles here are relatively quite               rapid.  Measurements with novel technology will allow new results               at a very fine level in time and space, to determine how vascular               units composed of groups of capillaries regulate flow in response               to demand.  The impact of this novel work will be high not only                 on the obvious clinical issues, but on the many areas of                        neuroscience that deal with functional architecture and activity                patterns in the brain.",
