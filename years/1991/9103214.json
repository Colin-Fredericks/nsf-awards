 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will continue his               work on orthogonal polynomials and integrals associated to                      Coxeter groups and root systems by means of a parametrized                      commutative algebra of differential-difference operators.  In                   particular, he will look at the intertwining operator which                     relates these algebras for different parameter values.  This                    operator is conjectured to be a new type of fractional integral                 operator supported by a subset of the group algebra.  There is a                relationship to Poisson kernels that could lead to explicit                     integral forms.                                                                      The principal investigator is analyzing orthogonal                         polynomials that are associated to Coxeter groups and their root                systems, in order to study questions involving differential-                    difference operators, kernels of integral operators, and special                functions associated with the Laplace operator.  Orthogonal                     polynomials arise in an essential way in a number of different                  areas, such as numerical analysis, approximation theory and                     differential equations.  In this project the principal                          investigator will use the algebraic structure associated with                   these polynomials to extend our knowledge of the symmetry                       properties of the polynomials.",
