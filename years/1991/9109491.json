 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will study the                  SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs equations in three-space in the case of a                positive coupling constant.  Her goal is to show the existence of               non-minimal finite-action critical points of the SU(2) Yang-Mills-              Higgs functional in three-space with arbitrary positive coupling                constant, thereby extending the work of Taubes for the case of zero             coupling constant.  Taubes was able to establish a form of the                  Liusternik-Schnirelman min-max theory that applies to the                       variational problems in three-space that arise in gauge theory.                 The principal investigator hopes to establish a similar result that             applies in the case of positive coupling constant.                              She will collaborate with Taubes and other experts in the course of             her research.                                                                        Gauge theory is now one of the fundamental areas in                        mathematical physics. It contains a number of deep and important                problems that are of interest to mathematicians and physicists.                 One of these problems involves the properties of finite-action                  solutions of certain variational equations that arise in the Yang-              Mills theory in three-space.  The principal investigator will focus             on an important problem in this area, namely showing the existence              of non-minimal finite-action critical points of the Yang-Mills                  functional in the case when the coupling constant is positive.",
