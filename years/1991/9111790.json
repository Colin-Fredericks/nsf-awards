 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study analyzes what accounts for offending careers from                    adolescence to young adulthood.  The research takes advantage of                a longitudinal data base collected from a sample of approximately               500 adolescent males who were initially interviewed in 1982-83 when             their ages ranged from 11 to 17 and reinterviewed in 1990-91 when               they were ages 19 to 25.  Sampling for the study was carried out                in two stages:  First, 12 urban neighborhoods representing a                    crossed array in terms of levels of family disorganization,                     neighborhood, social rank, and predominant race group (black or                 white) were selected.  In the second stage, households in each of               the areas were listed and screened.  Eligible households were then              grouped into single vs. two-parent households and stratified random             samples were drawn.  The purpose of this study is to (1) identify               contextual and individual-level risk factors associated with                    patterns of onset and suspension of offending; (2) delineate the                relationship among type of community context, characteristics of                interpersonal networks, and offending behavior in young adulthood;              and (3) develop a model of change and stability in offending which              incorporates individual level risk factors and the conditional                  effects of social context.                                                                                                                                      Substantively, the research builds on extant longitudinal studies               in postulating the effects of early behavior and of later role                  transitions on the dynamics of change over time.  Distinctively,                it also examines the conditional effects of macrosocial factors on              these individual-level processes.  The importance of cross-level                theorizing and related empirical study cannot be overemphasized.                Linking neighborhood characteristics and individual factors is a                long overdue research strategy in this arena of work.   By focusing             specifically on these macro-micro linkages, this study promises to              advance our most basic understandings about delinquency and crime.",
