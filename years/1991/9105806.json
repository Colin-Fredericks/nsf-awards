 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been known for quite some time that metaphors and                        analogies can redescribe an object, thereby creating new                        perspectives on it.  However, this phenomenon has not yet been                  properly addressed in cognitive science and AI research.                        Previous work has identified and characterized this process of                  redescription that underlies creative instances of metaphor and                 analogy.  This work will implement a computational model of                     resdescription in the proportional analogy domain.  In this                     framework, an object is seen as an element of a finitely                        generated algebra, and a \"description of the object is defined to               be any possible way in which that object can be generated from                  other objects by applying appropriate operators.  Typically, an                 object can be generated in many ways and, consequently, has many                descriptions.  In designing the model, the problem then, is to                  find efficient algorithms and heuristics which select appropriate               descriptions of the objects so that the analogy relation is                     comprehensible.",
