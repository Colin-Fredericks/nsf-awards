 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues research on nonlinear regularities that                  emerge from apparently chaotic daily and weekly movements in                    financial asset prices.  The research focuses on intriguing                     regularities in the behavior of stock market indices and foreign                exchange markets discovered earlier by the investigator.  The                   results of the research should improve our understanding of the                 way institutions for processing information affect the stability                of financial markets.  It should also provide better statistical                techniques based on chaos theory for studying nonlinear                         relationships in economic time series.                                                                                                                          The project addresses the connections between correlations and                  volatility in stock returns series at the daily and weekly                      frequencies.  These correlation patterns are shown to change with               changing market volatility levels.  Correlations are larger at                  smaller volatility levels.  The robustness of the results is                    determined by analyzing data for individual firms.  Some possible               causes for the results are explored.  Transactions costs and                    costs of acquiring new information may cause prices to be less                  informative during quieter periods.  If these costs are unrelated               to the level of volatility then periods of low volatility may                   appear less \"efficient\" in the sense of positive correlations.                  New information may take several days to get impounded into                     prices.  These correlations may also be the result of market                    maker interventions.  In their attempts at maintaining price                    continuity market makers actions could show up as positive                      correlations.  During volatile periods information and prices are               changing so fast that the actions of the market maker are not                   observed over the daily horizon.  A closely related issue is how                quickly limit orders are being eliminated and if these also carry               across the daily boundaries.",
