 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year collaborative project between                Dr. Benno P. Schoenborn, Center for Structural Biology, Brookhaven              National Laboratory, and Professor Hans G. L. Coster, University of             New South Wales, Kensington, Australia, under the U.S.-Australia                Cooperative Science Program.  The scientists will cooperate in                  measuring the dielectric constants of selected protein crystals.                Such information is important in understanding electrostatic                    interactions within and between protein molecules.  These interactions          are believed to play key roles in biologically important protein                functions.                                                                                                                                                      Crystalline myoglobin will be studied initially in this project.                The procedure is experimentally difficult, requiring micro-                     instrumentation as well as the use of extremely small electric                  currents.  Existing equipment and instrumentation need to be                    improved before the measurements can be carried out, new computer               software must be developed, and the theoretical approach used to                convert the measured impedance values to useful dielectric constants            needs to be further investigated.  The respective strengths of the              cooperating laboratories will be utilized in carrying out these                 preliminary tasks, as well as in the later measurements and data                analysis.  Dr. Schoenborn is an expert in using neutron scattering              and other techniques to investigate the structure of proteins.                  Professor Coster has had considerable experience in impedance                   measurements of membranes.  Working together in this project they               expect to be able to obtain an increased understanding of protein               structures and of the relationship between structure and function.",
