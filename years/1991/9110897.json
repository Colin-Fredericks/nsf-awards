 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research by Dr. Woollacott is aimed at the hypothesis that the             development of balance control and walking requires the maturation              of a number of body systems, including the nervous system, muscular             system and skeletal system. The specific aim is to measure the                  times at which individual components (neural, muscular and                      skeletal) develop amd mature, in order to determine which                       components are the last to develop and thus limit the emergence of              stance. This project is a longitudinal study of the development of              balance in individual children from 8 to 18 months of age.                      Measurements will include: 1) the muscle activation patterns used               in balance, 2) the movements of the individual body parts during                balance, 3) the use of vision, vestibular (inner ear), and                      proprioceptive (muscle sensation) senses in balance control, 4)                 changes in muscle strength, and 5) changes in body size and body                proportions, across the age range of 8 to 18 months. These                      experiments will allow the creation of a model of postural                      development, including a time frame of maturation of individual                 body subcomponents, which will be useful in predicting the                      development of balance and walking abilites in children. This work              will contribute to understanding the emergence and maturation of                independent standing and walking in children.",
