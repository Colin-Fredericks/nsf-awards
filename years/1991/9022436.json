 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves several areas of study using anodic                      oxidation for the preparation of novel compounds, or compounds                  difficultly available via conventional chemistry. First, the                    anodic oxidation of p-hydrogen and p-alkyl anilides will be                     studied as a route to acylated quinone imine ketal and quinol                   ethers. These compounds, which are not available from                           conventional routes, can serve as key intermediates in organic                  synthesis. The second area, and major emphasis of the work, is                  development of high-yield anodic carbon-carbon bond-forming                     reactions. The initial studies will be directed at                              intramolecular trapping of oxidized phenol intermediates with                   unsaturated linkages resulting in carbon-carbon bond formation.                 The products obtained from 4-(2'-unsaturated-aryl)-phenols are                  2,5-cyclohexadienones which are important intermediates in                      organic synthesis. The objectives are to understand how                         substituents on both the aryl and phenol rings influence the                    yield of the anodic carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction and                     utilize this knowledge for the efficient preparation of useful                  compounds or intermediates. Another objective is to investigate                 the use of the products obtained from these anodic oxidation                    studies in organic synthesis.                                                                                                                                   %%%                                                                                                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                  Division will support the research of Dr. John S. Swenton of                    the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University. The                       research involves the study of anodic oxidation chemistry for                   the preparation of novel compounds, or compounds difficultly                    available via conventional chemistry. This approach using                       synthetic electrochemistry is very timely since it serves as a                  reagentless method for effecting oxidations, reductions, and                    carbon-carbon bond formation. With the proper selection of                      electrode and experimental conditions, electrochemistry is the                  environmental choice for conducting chemical transformations                    since there is no spent oxidant or reductant to be disposed of                  or recycled after the reaction.",
