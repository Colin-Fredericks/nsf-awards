 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the first phase of this NSF sponsored Small Business                     Innovation Research project, Intersonics Inc. demonstrated the                  feasibility of employing a polarimetric method to measure precisely             the spectral emissivity and optical properties of reflecting and                partially specular surfaces. The measured emissivity was used to                correct radiometric data obtained from a conventional pyrometer                 resulting in a non-contact true surface temperature determination               of radiating bodies. The phase II research to be undertaken, will               further asses the validity of the approach on different materials               and different surfaces. Two independent methods will be employed to             determine the true emissivity, and the results of the two                       approaches compared. This will provide an objective assessment of               the true potential of the instrument, and the limits of it's                    accuracy to non-contact high temperature measurements of smooth as              well as rough and film covered surfaces. Phase II experiments will              include: (i) optical properties of: smooth solid and liquid metal               surfaces at high temperatures; rough surfaces with varying                      roughness: materials with single and multi-layer dielectric films;              (ii) dielectric function and spectral emissivities of incandescent              surfaces using their self emission at non-normal angles; and (iii)              spectral emissivities of materials of commercial interest. It is                expected that this project will result in the development of an                 instrument which will have large demand in order to achieve process             temperature control in numerous manufacturing operations.//",
