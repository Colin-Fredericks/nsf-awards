 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have proposed a method to reduce the size of a                               compact x-ray lithography machine used for etching                              the next-generation high-density computer chips.  A                             high gradient electron accelerator powered by a                                 relativistic klystron is used in place of the                                   conventional linac as an injector to a superconducting                          synchrotron radiation ring to produce intense x-rays.                           Recent experimental results have demonstrated that                              electrons can reach the same final energy in a much                             shorter section of the high gradient accelerator than                           the conventional linac.  The proposed machine is                                therefore much smaller than the conventional x-ray                              synchrotron machines.  The compact machine enables                              manufacturers to utilize high-energy, high-intensity x-                         rays to produce various high-density computer chips                             in a factory environment.  In Phase I of this research,                         we will perform conceptual studies for the injection                            system, and will consider the related physics and                               engineering issues for combining the relativistic                               klystron high gradient accelerator (RK/HGA) and                                 the superconducting synchrotron radiation ring                                  (SSRR) into a single x-ray production machine.                                  Particular consideration will be given to the                                   compatibility of the extremely short pulses produced                            by the RK/HGA and the macropulses required by                                   the SSRR, to the preservation of electron beam                                  emittance, and to tradeoff studies of various kicker                            magnet configurations in order to ensure efficient                              transfer of the beam from the RK/HGA to the                                     SSRR.",
