 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Thomas A. Edison Papers is a historical editing project that                is preparing and publishing two major editions of Edison and                    Edison-related documents.  One of the most prolific and influential             inventors in history, Thomas Edison was at the center of majro                  social and technical changes that shaped the twentieth century.                 He left five million pages of correspondence, lab notes, and                    related business records that provide significant insights into his             diverse technical creativity, his relationships with technial and               financial communities, and his world-wide entrepreneurship--                    insights that should inform current and future scholarship,                     education, public discourse, and public policy.                                                                                                                 This grant supports two editors to select, organize, index,                     research, and annotate the most historically significant documents              among these 5 million pages to text.  During the period of this                 grant, the staff is preparing Part III of the microfilm edition and             Volume Three of the editon.  Among materials to be covered by these             publications and the next volumes to follow are Edison's work with              ore milling, motion pictures, phonograph and phonograph recording               manufacture, mass scale cement production, priamary battery and                 chemical manufacture, telegraphy and telephony, the introducition               of sound recornding, and development of incandescent lgithing and               electric power generation and distribution systems.",
