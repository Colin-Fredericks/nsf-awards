 "awd_abstract_narration": "In temperate ecosystems, most benthic communities exhibit                       between-year variability in the seasonal appearance and                         abundance of their opportunistic members.  It seems likely that                 the life-history strategies of these organisms directly                         regulates their growth and reproduction.  This may result form                  annual differences in the availability of dietary                               micronutrients.  Opportunistic, deposit-feeding polychaetes                     face a unique nutritional constraint: their small body size                     limits the amount of assimilated materials they can store.                      They are dependent on the immediate availabilities of their                     dietary requirements to fuel their growth and reproduction.                     Although growth and reproduction in opportunists in stimulated                  by food supply, little is known about the dietary components                    that regulate how much and how fast an opportunist can grow.                    This project will assess the potential for two micronutrients                   (vitamin D and the carotenoid, B-Carotene) to stimulate somatic                 cell divisions at the gene transcription level in the                           polycheate worm, Streblospio benedicti.  The C-myc                              protooncogne will be used to assay tissue responses to dietary                  composition immediately (0-24h) after feeding.  Quantifying c-                  myc mRNA transcript levels will provide an instantaneous                        snapshot of cell division activity in a tissue sample.                          Relating tissue responses to a life-history pattern of rapid                    growth and reproduction will primarily focus on evaluating the                  potential for vitamin D or B-carotene to initiate and maintain                  mitotic cycling independent of dietary composition.",
