 "awd_abstract_narration": "A NATURAL HISTORY OF THE SENSES is a five-part series                      to be produced by WETA fornational PBS broadcast in the                         1993-94 season.  The series is to be adapted from the best-                     selling book of the same title.  Its author, Diane Ackerman,                    will present the programs and collaborate with the producers                    throughout.  Each program will focus on a single sense:                         smell, touch, taste, hearing and vision respectively.  Each                     will explore: how the world is sensed by animals and humans,                    including the evolution of the sense; what is perceived; and                    how human beings reconstruct and recreate their sensory                         worlds, through cuisines and perfumes, music, sculpture and                     painting.  Shot on location around the world, these                             documentary films will incorporate viewpoints from anatomy,                     physiology and neurochemistry, experimental and perceptual                      psychology, cultural anthropology, literature, art, music                       and history.  Compelling stories and illustrative vignettes                     and precise graphic animation will arise from rigorous                          research, in collaboration with a board of advisors.  By                        unifying material from science and the arts and humanities,                     the series will reach a general audience.  Viewers will be                      awakened to a new awareness of the range and power of their                     senses.  Companion materials for schools will extend the                        series to the formal learning environment and will motivate                     further study.",
