The study will be based on extensive tape-recorded                  samples of the Seneca language, presently spoken by about 200                   people in western New York State, recordings that will also                     provide a permanent record of the language for present and future               generations of the Seneca people.  The number of speakers of                    Seneca is rapidly diminishing, and knowledge of how the language                is used under natural circumstances by the last generation of                   fully fluent speakers must be obtained now or never.                                                                                                            The project will combine the expertise of a linguist experienced                in work with the Seneca language, whose primary theoretical                     interest is in discourse phenomena, and a Seneca speaker who has                been actively involved in pedagogical and descriptive work on her               language, whose other projects have put her in close touch with                 people from whom recordings can be obtained.  The project will                  test hypotheses developed so far largely on the basis of English                data, confirming or modifying them on the basis of data from a                  typologically distinct language.",
