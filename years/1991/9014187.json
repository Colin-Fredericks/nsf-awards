 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, a major focus of crime etiology has been                  opportunity theories of victimization.  The appeal of these                     theories has been the idea that opportunity, as much as criminal                motivation, is a necessary element for crime to occur.  Despite the             popularity of opportunity theory, neither theoretical nor empirical             research has gone much beyond the original principles articulated               in the late 1970's.  The development of the theory has been slowed              by the over-reliance on secondary data which has limited the                    refinement of concepts and the testing of theoretical propositions.             As a result, the theory is not sufficiently developed to                        operationalize key opportunity concepts.                                                                                                                        This collaborative project will expedite theory building by using               a case-control design to refine and test the theory as it applies               to non-commercial robbery.  A sample of 50 robbery victims and 50               nonvictims will be interviewed using both structured and semi-                  structured questions.  Qualitative and quantitative information                 will be collected on both the lifestyle and ecological contexts of              each group.  This information will be used to determine (1) the                 situational and lifestyle circumstances associated with becoming                a robbery victim and (2) discernable differences between victims                and nonvictims in terms of their ecological and lifestyle patterns.                                                                                             The results of the research will enable refinements to the criminal             opportunity model as it applies to victimization.  As importantly,              it will provide an assessment of the utility of the case-control                design for testing opportunity models.  Beyond advancing theory and             methodology in criminological research, results of this research                could have significant implications for crime reduction.",
