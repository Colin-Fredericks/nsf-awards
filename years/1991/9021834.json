 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Mississippi for the renovation and repair of Lewis                Hall and the accelerator building which, after the consolidation                to be accomplished, will house all the physical research and                    research training activities of the Department of Physics.  These               buildings were constructed, respectively, in 1939 and 1950.  Lewis              Hall has never been renovated, while the accelerator building was               last renovated in 1980.  The ARFMP grant of $889,260 and $1,264,607             provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize               these research and research training facilities and to consolidate              all research training activities in physics in one contiguous                   facility.  This project will address the need to improve the                    current research infrastructure by eliminating water leakage,                   providing adequate power, and achieving proper climate control to               enable more reliable and meaningful experiments to be carried out.                                                                                              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.                The Department of Physics at the University of Mississippi has a                particular commitment to educating nontraditional students who                  would be unlikely to go to college outside the mid-south or to                  begin graduate school outside this region.",
