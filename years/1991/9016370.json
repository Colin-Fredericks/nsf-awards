 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Electron Microscopy Center of The University of South                       Carolina has supported ultrastructural research activities of                   over 900 faculty members and students during the past 19 years.                 The users are from almost every science department, institution,                and college including the Department of Biological Sciences,                    Chemistry, and Physics, and the College of Engineering.  The                    Center has assisted faculty members to obtain research grants by                providing them with ultrastructural research facilities for                     projects involving electron microscopy.  Federal grants thus                    obtained during the past three years alone amounted to over three               million dollars.                                                                                                                                                The Center's only high resolution transmission electron                         microscope was acquired 17 years ago.  Because of heavy usage and               old age, the microscope in recent years has been out of order                                                                                                   frequently for extended periods of time.  Thus, the research                    activities of many investigators have been seriously jeopardized.                                                                                               Also, the microscope in now obsolete.  It does not have                         resolution and analytical capability comparable to modern models.                                                                                                                                                                               The proposal is a request for funding of the acquisition of a                   high resolution, high performance, 200 KV analytical transmission               electron microscope with various components offered to us by                    Hitachi, Ltd., Japan, with the understanding that the University                will match approximately half the cost and South Carolina sales                 tax.  Primary users are from the Department of Biological                       Sciences and Chemistry.  The majority of those research projects                are funded by the National Science Foundation.  Seven major and                 four minor projects are outlined in the proposal.",
