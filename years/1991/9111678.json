 "awd_abstract_narration": "A complex array of both abiotic and biotic factors interact                to  structure marine and lacustrine benthic communities.  Many                  ecologists consider the role of predators important to the                      understanding of how natural communities work.  Stream                          ecologists, however, do not agree on the importance of predation                to stream communities.  Some studies find direct and indirect                   effects if predators, while others find no effects at all.  The                 disagreement may arise because of differences in the flow regimes               of the streams and habitats studied by different researchers.                        This study focuses on temporal variation in the importance                 of fish predation to stream benthic community structure and how                 spates and isolation of stream pools interact with predation.                   Mesocosms and in situ manipulative experiments will be used to                  experimentally test the importance of fish predation in streams                 during different seasons.  The major objectives are 1. to measure               seasonal changes in the effects of predatory fish on benthic                    communities; and 2. to calculate the importance of predation                    relative to spates in determining community structure throughout                a year.  These data will help further our understanding of the                  importance of top predators in streams.",
