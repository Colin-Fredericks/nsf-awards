 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's industrial labor market is characterized by a good deal                 of \"structure.\"  Long-term labor contracts, collective bargaining               arrangements, seniority rules, internal promotion ladders,                      pension plans, and other forms of employee vesting are thought to               limit the flexibility of wages, raise the natural rate of                       unemployment and exacerbate macroeconomic fluctuations.  The same               structures have been implicated in the creation of a \"dual labor                market\" that some feel has worked to the disadvantage of an                     underclass of workers.  Spurred by intriguing new theoretical                   insights on the microeconomic foundations of macroeconomic                      theory, a great deal of attention has recently been focused on                  the origins and implications of these aspects of labor market                   structure.  This project undertakes research on the origins of                  the modern American labor market.  Its focus will be on the                     critical period between 1880 and 1914.  A detailed study of this                period will provide an insightful contrast with recent experience               and would sharpen further our understanding of macroeconomic                    phenomena both then and now.                                                                                                                                    Data are collected from over 150 separate investigations                        undertaken between 1874 and 1920 by 29 state Bureaus of Labor                   Statistics.  These bureaus published surveys of working-class                   families containing data on wages, hours of work, time lost to                  unemployment and illness, family expenditures, and a long list of               other economic and social characteristics.  They also published                 surveys of firms and other Special Reports dealing with                         conditions in the labor markets.  Using these data from the late                nineteenth and early twentieth century, the project will examine                such issues as changes in labor input, the degree of wage                       flexibility, the heterogeneity and duration of unemployment; the                pattern of age-earning profiles; changes in job tenure; the                     presence and importance of inter-industry wage differentials;                   labor productivity and short-term increasing returns to labor;                  and the opportunities for self-employment.",
