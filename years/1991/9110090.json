 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to develop a new                           approach for the modelling, analysis and design of                              stochastic discrete event dynamic systems (DEDS).                               The proposed approach is based on obtaining the                                 Maclaurin series of the performance measure as a                                function of a decision parameter.  Our objectives are                           (i) to develop efficient recursive expressions for the                          Maclaurin coefficients for a large class of stochastic                          DEDS and (ii) to investigate the theoretical and                                practical implications of the obtained Maclaurin series.                        The results of this project would form a powerful                               complement to existing methodologies for stochastic                             DEDS.  In particular, we will develop simple closed                             form approximations of the performance measures for                             the purpose of analysis and design, as well as some                             stochastic DEDS modelling guidelines analogous to                               those in the classical Bode-Nyquist methodology for                             modelling continous variable dynamic systems.",
