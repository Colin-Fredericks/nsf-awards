 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research conducted at Massachusetts Technological Laboratory (MTL) has          demonstrated significant gains in execution speed in phased array               algorithms for null-steering and adaptive nulling by implementation in          the fine-grained (\"data level\") parallel computational architecture of          the Connection machine.  Such work suggests that significant gains in           phased array performance may be obtained by the development of a                \"smart\" phased array, where computational elements are dispersed among          the phased array elements and an appropriate network of                         interconnections for transfer of information between processors is              provided.  Such a \"smart\" phased array has the potential for                    substantially reduced high data-rates, large bandwidth communication            with a central computer, and rapid (microsecond time scale) nulling.            Additional capabilities for the real-time monitoring  of array                  performance and limited automatic failure compensation                          (\"self-healing\") also appear promising.  The Connection Machine                 is highly suitable for the development of algorithmic tools and                 simulations for the study of \"smart\" phased arrays.  A program of               research to demonstrate the feasibility of \"smart\" phased arrays by             simulations on the Connection Machine and for the study of their                properties is outlined.",
