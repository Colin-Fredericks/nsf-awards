 "awd_abstract_narration": "Membrane damage in the form of lipid peroxidation may mediate the               cytotoxic effects of many photoactivatable dyes and pigments                    (photodynamic sensitizers).  Lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs) generated             by sensitized photooxidation of unsaturated phospholipids and                   cholesterol have numerous adverse effects on membrane structure and             function.  Many aspects of photoperoxidation are still poorly                   understood at the molecular and cellular level, including (a)                   relative reactivity of different lipid classes and how this is                  modulated; and (b) enzymatic detoxification reactions, specifically             those involving selenium and glutathione.  Building on past                     experience in membrane photooxidation, this project will address                each of these questions in comprehensive fashion, progressing form              studies on model systems (liposomal membranes, erythrocyte ghosts)              to the cellular domain (cultured leukemia and endothelial cells).               A variety of biologically relevant sensitizers (porphyrins,                     phthalocyanines) and state-of-the-art analytical techniques                     (clonogenic survival assays, liquid chromatography with                         radiochemical and electrochemical detection) will be used.  These               studies are timely and relevant in view of (a) the rapid                        development of practical new approaches that exploit photodynamic               effects (e.g. phototherapies), and (b) the growing risks of                     environmental toxicity.//",
