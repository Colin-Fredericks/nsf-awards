 "awd_abstract_narration": "Time-dependent problems of interest in radiation biology                   will be investigated mathematically.  Emphasis will be on using                 analytic solutions, bounds or approximations to understand                      numerical results and vice-versa.  Detailed comparisons of the                  mathematical results with current published experiments will be                 made.  The main project is to use continuous time Markov chains                 for modeling ionizing radiation damage to mammalian cells.  The                 specific generators used will be modifications of those                         introduced in recent papers (Albright 1989; Tobias et al. 1989;                 Curtis 1989; Sachs et al. 1990; Hlatky et al. 1990; Hahnfeldt et                al. 1991).  The following biological endpoints will be                          considered:  (A) the yield of DNA double strand breaks and other                chromosome damage during irradiation; (B) the yield and variance                of chromosome aberrations evolving from DNA double strand breaks                via enzymatic cellular repair and misrepair processes during                    and after irradiation; (C) the fraction of cells clonogenically                 viable after irradiation.  In (B) and (C) the main mathematical                 technique will be to use the embedded discrete time Markov chain                to work out the long time asymptotic behavior in a form suitable                for numerical evaluation and comparison to experiments,                         especially experiments on human lymphocytes.  (A) mainly involves               use of perturbation theory and of Perron-Frobenius theory for                   the eigenvalues of the generator.  Many older models applicable                 to one of these endpoints can be regarded as deterministic                      approximations to the Markov models and the domain of validity of               such approximations will be systematically studied.  A secondary                project will be to use the full, time-dependent                                 reaction-diffusion equations with realistic reaction terms for                  analyzing spheroid tumor models.                                                     Mathematical modeling of ionizing radiation damage to DNA is               particularly important in relating experimental results for                     moderate radiation doses to results at the very low doses and                   dose rates which are most relevant in public health concerns.                   Unlike most older models, the models to be used here                            systematically take into account fluctuations in dose and                       response from cell to cell.  The results will contribute to a                   basic understanding of how chromosome aberrations such as                       dicentrics develop following ionizing radiation.  Such                          understanding in turn should improve methods of biological                      dosimetry, of risk assessment for exposures to radioactivity, and               of radiotherapy.",
