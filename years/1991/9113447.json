 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project supports an anthropology                     student from the University of Michigan studying changes in                     marriage patterns in two tribal communities in eastern Indonesia.               The project will examine the effects of cash crop production (in                one group) on traditional marriage exchanges and responsibilities               within and between family groups.  One group has substituted cash               exchanges for traditional goods, and the project hypothesizes                   that these cash exchanges are associated with increasing social                 stratification.  Methods include local surveys, participant                     observation, and structured interviewing.                                                                                                                       This research is important because tribal groups all over the                   world are becoming increasingly monetized.  Understanding how the               commercial aspects of their lives changes traditional social                    relations will help policy makers deal with these usually                       negative aspects of economic development.",
