 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Cohen and Pastor propose to study output from the model                    LINKAGES for the purpose of identifying a strange attractor. The                LINKAGES model simulates feedback responses of a forested                       ecosystem to atmospheric and soil changes.  It also simulates                   births, growth, and deaths of individual trees and the decay and                N dynamics of annual cohorts in litter of a 1/2 ha plot.  The                   model is one of the most widely used and verified models of its                 kind.  Preliminary results indicate that the model produces a                   low-dimensional strange attractor and therefore reflects a                      chaotic dynamical system.  Cohen and Pastor found that some                     essential properties of the model as a dynamical system are lost                when outputs are averaged over several plots.  These preliminary                findings have profound implications for the use and further                     development of the LINKAGES model: 1) because of sensitivity to                 initial conditions, long-term model predictions cannot be                       trusted, 2) the investigators contend that extending the model to               include spatial considerations is essential, and 3) the fact that               the model produces a low-dimensional strange attractor means that               there are few basic mechanisms that control the macroscopic                     behavior of the model.                                                                                                                                          By extending the model to include spatial mechanisms, Cohen and                 Pastor will investigate the fractal dimension of plant species                  distributions over the landscape as they are produced by the                    model.  The investigators will then used data on spatial                        distributions of plant species in a relevant area, and compare                  the fractal dimension of the real distribution to that produced                 by the model.                                                                                                                                                   Drs. Cohen and Pastor are innovative and productive scientists                  who are experienced with the problems of the development and                    validation of large, complex ecosystem models. These models are                 used for predicting the effects of climate change on the                        biosphere and may be essential tools for managing resources in                  the future.  This research is an essential test of the behavior                 of these models.  The institutional support for this research is                outstanding.",
