 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transcription of the HO gene in the yeast S. cerevisiae is subject              to three separate types of control.  Transcription is repressed in              diploids, (a/d repression); it is activated in haploids, but only               those which have undergone cell division (mother cells).  Finally,              activation of HO transcription is restricted to the late GI phase               of the cell cycle (cell cycle control).  UAS elements in distinct               upstream regulatory regions (URS) mediate mother/daughter control               (URSI) and cell cycle control (URS2).  These UAS elements can act               automonously to activate HO transcription when they are physically              separated from each other.  However, within the context of the HO               promoter, neither UAS is sufficient to activate transcription.                  Deletions which remove URSI from the HO promoter prevent HO                     transcription.  In addition, mutations in either of two regulatory              proteins which specifically mediate transcription from the UAS in               URS2 also eliminate HO transcription.  Such results imply the                   existence of an additional negative control region within the                   intact promoter whose action is only overcome when both URSI and                URS2 are active.  The experiments in this research planning grant               are designed to genetically identify and characterize the sites                 and trans-acting factors involved in this negative control.",
