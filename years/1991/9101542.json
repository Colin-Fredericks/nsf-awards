 "awd_abstract_narration": "On this new research effort several numerical studies will be                   undertaken on particles with fractional statistics (anyons).                    Fractional statistics arise in connection with particle number                  fractionalization in two dimensions; it has been shown to occur in              the fractional quantum Hall effect, and may also occur in the high              temperature superconductors.  A stochastic sampling (Monte Carlo)               algorithm for fractional statistics will be developed and tested.               This work is the first of its kind and should substantially enhance             our ability to treat the many-anyon problem.  Studies of exact                  diagonalization techniques for anyons will continue.  In                        particular, we will examine the magnetic moment arising from the                screening by anyons of a charged impurity; the temperature                      dependence of the spontaneous magnetic moment in the unperturbed                system; and the Hall conductance of anyons in zero field.                       %%%                                                                             The discovery of the possible relevance of particles obeying                    fractional statistics to the fractional quantum Hall effect and                 high temperature superconductivity has renewed interest in these                strange particles called anyons.  These particles are unique to                 two-dimensional space and possess properties different than the                 more conventional bosons and fermions.  While anyons are of                     fundamental theoretical interest, their possible relevance to high              temperature superconductors has stimulated searches for                         experimental verification of their role in these two-dimensional                materials.",
