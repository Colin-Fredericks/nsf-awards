 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preliminary examination of a long model run of the NCAR CCM                with idealized geography indicates that the surface temperature                 field can be interpreted as an system forced by noise in space-                 time.  The linear system can be interpreted as an energy-balance                climate model (EBM) with diffusive horizontal heat transport and                linear radiation damping.                                                                                                                                            The surface temperature field in both models has several                   interesting properties.  For example, the spatial correlation                   statistics are essentially isotropic over distances of a few                    thousand km.  The spatial correlations fall off with a                          characteristic length of about 1500 km which agrees with the EBM                and with surface temperature data. Linear theory suggests that                  climatological (=time averaged) responses to point heat sources                 should exhibit a spatial pattern identical to the equal times                   spatial auto correlation function.  This appears to be the case                 in the CCM surface data.  These pieces of evidence help to                      explain why the EBM has been so successful in earlier studies of                the seasonal cycle and even in various paleoclimate scenarios                   compared to data and GCMs.  This research will study the                        underlying mechanisms of climate variability and change using                   simple models.  The PI will systematically examine the fluxes and               related meteorological fields in order to clarify the reasons for               the apparant linearity of climate fluctuation and response                      phenomena.  This research is important because it may give                      insight into how the climate system works - a pre-requisite for                 more credible predictions of future climates.",
