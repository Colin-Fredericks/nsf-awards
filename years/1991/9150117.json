 "awd_abstract_narration": "STAT-MAPS will develop materials for teaching                              statistics grades 9-12.  STAT-MAPS builds on the experience                     and results of SIM-PAC, a previous NSF/MDR project, and will                    be done concurrently with STAT-LINC, a NSF/PTE project.                                                                                                              The STAT-MAPS instructional design is based on                             experiential learning through engagement with problem                           solving activities.  STAT-MAPS begins with statistical                          foundations for problem solving, specifies learning                             objectives through its activities and provides materials to                     implement the instructional strategies.                                                                                                                              The materials development plan provides for extensive                      class testing and review.  The expected outcomes are a                          student text and activities manual, and a teacher manual and                    teacher version of the activities manual.  The materials are                    comprehensive, giving special attention to the needs of the                     teacher as well as the student.  The materials are designed                     for use in statistics courses as well as providing units for                    other courses.                                                                                                                                                       STAT-MAPS anticipates the commercial publication of                        materials and provides an evaluation scheme for its work.",
