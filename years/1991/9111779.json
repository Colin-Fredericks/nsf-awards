 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Nersessian is addressing a central question in the area of                  science and technology studies:  how do new conceptual structures               emerge in scientific revolutions.  Philosophers and historians of               science have been divided on the issue:  some have viewed                       conceptual change in science as occurring suddenly, often as a                  psychological Gestalt switch;  others have viewed change as                     extended over a long period of time.  This project seeks to show                how a more refined understanding of conceptual change can be                    achieved by combining the short-term cognitive -- or psychological              -- approach with the long-term historical one.  It does so on the               basis of two premises.  First, the extant literature has                        demonstrated that conceptual change in science is rarely, if ever,              sudden.  Hence, in order to understand the evolution of conceptual              change, the temporal perspective of history is needed.   Second,                conceptual change in science has its roots in ordinary thinking;                the representational and problem-solving practices of scientists                and outgrowths and refinements of ordinary cognitive resources.                 This investigation unites the resources of two methods normally                 kept separate by applying a new interdisciplinary method that                   deploys modern tools of cognitive analysis in fine-structure long-              term examinations of theoretical and experimental practices                     responsibly for major conceptual innovations.",
