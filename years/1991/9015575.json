 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to provide renewed support for completion                      of a project initiated under NSF Grant No. 88-07774 to                          investigate a novel concept for decontamination of water                        that contains organic pollutants.  Prior work had                               indicated that in the presence of polyethylene oxide,                           decomposition products of irradiation were scavenged from                       solution suggesting that free radical species formed                            during irradiation were coupled to radical sites formed on                      the polymer.  The work to be conducted will concentrate on                      the dose-rate effect of electron beam radiation to                              determine whether the observed coupling of free radicals                        formed during radiation is proportional to their                                concentration which in turn is proportional to dose-rate.                       The investigator plans to modify the electron-beam                              accelerator used in prior work to allow a ten-fold                              increase in dose rate and plans to use a pulsed linear                          accelerator made available for his use in MIT's Plasma                          Fusion Laboratory to achieve dose rates several orders of                       magnitude larger than possible by use of the Van de Graaff                      accelerator previously used in his research.                                                                                                                    The presence of organic contaminants in water is a problem                      of considerable significance as it relates to usefulness                        of water for municipal and industrial purposes.  This                           research on a method for destruction of these contaminants                      by use of ionizing radiation is expected to provide                             guidance for its potential use in engineering design of                         processes and systems to decontaminate water and                                wastewater.",
