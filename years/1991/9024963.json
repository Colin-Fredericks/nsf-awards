 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with modeling (derivation and                    presentation of equations of motion) and analysis (perturbation                 methods, bifurcation techniques, numerical methods, etc.) devised               for and applied to problems in nonlinear, non-Fickian diffusion                 which have recently arisen in a variety of scientific and                       technological fields.  Central problems emerging in these new                   technologies are types of diffusive motion quite unlike anything                predicted by classical diffusion theory.  They involve nonlinear                fixed and free boundary value problems, phase transitions, sharp                (shock-like) propagating fronts, and discontinuous steady states.                    Progress in materials science has spawned an extraordinary                 wealth of new exciting scientific and technological problems.                   For example, polymers and composites are replacing traditional                  materials in many older scientific, engineering and commercial                  applications, and wholly new fields with a dazzling array of new                applications are emerging because of the existence of new                       synthetic polymers and composites.  This project deals with                     modeling and analysis to develop valid theories for the behavior                of new materials and accurate control of their properties.",
