 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      George Homsy, Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford                      University and Dr. Elisabeth Guazelli, Ecole Superieure de                      Physique et Chimie Industrielles, Paris, France.  The objective                 of the project is to investigate the hydrodynamics of fluid                     particle systems.                                                                                                                                               The investigators will study hydrodynamic effects in                            suspensions and fluidized beds.  The behavior of such                           dispersed multiphase systems is important in a number of                        fields of science and technology.  These include applications                   in handling and processing materials such as:  1)  composites                   and emulsions, 2) chemical processing of fluids, as in                          fluidized bed reactors, 3) environmental fluid mechanics,                       such as sediment and nutrient transport in natural flows and                    4) separation technologies, such as flotation, sedimentation                    and clarification.  Despite intensive study of these fields                     over the last several decades, there are many fundamental                       aspects of the mechanical behavior of such systems that                         remain poorly understood, in particular, the interactions                       between the particles making up the dispersed phase. In this                    project, the investigators propose to carry out:  1)                            theoretical and numerical studies of hydrodynamic                               interactions between particles in suspension, and 2)                            experimental studies of the behavior of sedimenting suspen-                     sions, fluidized beds, and so-called \"ferro fluids\", i.e.                       suspensions of magnetic Brownian particles.  The primary                        focus of the French group will be the experimental studies,                     while that of the US will be theoretical and numerical                          modeling. The project will benefit from the availability of                     special NMR facilities for flow visualization in the French                     laboratory.",
