 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an RUI renewal request for research aimed at the                   development of detectors sufficiently sensitive to be used in                   a search for \"dark matter.\"  Such matter's existence is                         strongly suggested by a number of astrophysical measurements.                   It interacts gravitationally, but eludes direct observation.                    It may consist of weakly interacting, non-baryonic elementary                   particles such as neutrinos or other species predicted by                       grand unified theories.  Detectors of such particles require                    much lower threshold of sensitivity and larger cross section                    than offered by conventional devices.  The PI, in                               collaboration with Dr. B. Cabrera of Stanford U. and Dr. C. J.                  Martoff of Temple University has proposed the development of a                  \"silicon crystal acoustic detector (SiCAD)\" which senses                        ballistic phonons generated by the collision of incident                        particles with a nucleus or electron in a cube of ultra pure                    single-crystal silicon cooled below 0.1K.  The present                          proposal focusses upon her efforts to develop extremely                         sensitive superconducting tunnel junctions as phonon sensors,                   and uses modern integrated circuit fabrication techniques,                      many of which were developed locally in her S.F. State                          laboratory during the first three year grant.",
