 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Zimmer will study a variety of questions within the              general program of understanding the actions of semisimple Lie                  groups and their discrete subgroups on manifolds.  This includes an             investigation of the topological, geometric, and analytic                       properties of manifolds admitting such an action, and the measure               theoretic, topological, and geometric structure of the actions                  themselves.  The techniques of ergodic theory and algebraic groups,             combined with the geometric structure inherent in the situation,                will be essential throughout the work.  This award will also                    support three junior investigators who will conduct research in the             same general area.                                                                   Groups usually arise as transformations which preserve the                 symmetry of some system much as the group of rotations preserves                the symmetry of a sphere.  Given an abstract group there are often              many ways it can be realized or represented as a group of                       transformations.  There has been much research done on the                      representation of groups as linear transformations on a vector                  space.  It is in the still unchartered realm of nonlinear actions               of groups on curved surfaces or manifolds where Professor Zimmer's              research will take place.",
