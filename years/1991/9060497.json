 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radiation processing, particularly techniques for radiation enhanced            shelf life of foods, are important possible applications of electron            accelerators.  In order for this to become economically attractive, an          electron accelerator of 5 MeV maximum energy with an average beam               power of 500 kW must be developed.  Low frequency RF linacs (less than          300 Mhz.) are very attractive candidates for this application.  In              this work, we propose to build a 100 kV module of such an accelerator           with realistic beam loading and an inexpensive 200 Mhz. power triode            amplifier in order to test the capabilities this class of machine.              Techniques are proposed which will allow the majority of the 1 meter            cavities to be insulated with atmospheric pressure gas (Sulphur                 Hexafluoride), resulting in significant simplifications to the design           and cooling of such accelerators.  The module which will be developed           will also be tested in vacuum for comparison, and to estimate the               heating of the structure in vacuum.  The modular approach which we are          using significantly increases the fault tolerance and overall                   reliability of the accelerator.  If successful, the costs of high               power RF accelerators will be significantly reduced, and the power              levels of these accelerators will be significantly increased.",
