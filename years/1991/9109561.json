 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this project is to collect and analyze                    primary data to investigate gender differences in the tenure                    patterns of academic economists over the last two decades.                      Academic success, and the underlying mechanisms through which it                is achieved, is significant because of the value of understanding               employment in a well-defined labor market which requires immense                investments in human capital and is dominated by long-term                      contracts.  Employers and employees have heterogeneous                          characteristics, thus both engage in search to obtain or continue               job-worker matchings.  Given the recent focus of critical public                debate on the state of the educational system and its role in                   future productivity gains, understanding the role of gender                     differences in academic labor markets is of great consequence.                                                                                                  This project documents differences in the promotion process by                  measuring differences in the distribution by gender across: (1)                 fields of specialization; (2) ranks of employing and degree-                    granting academic institutions; and (3) publications patterns (by               rank of journal, type of publication, and co-authorship patterns)               and, second, analysis of data on mentoring, networking, and                     collaborating, all of which are frequently suggested to be                      important contributors to academic success.  New data on                        interrupted labor supply due to family responsibilities will be                 collected for women.  The planning period would be used to (1)                  determine availability and cost of collecting data to define an                 appropriate sample; (2) design, test, and evaluate a trial survey               instrument for data on interrupted labor supply; and (3) prepare                a NSF grant proposal.",
