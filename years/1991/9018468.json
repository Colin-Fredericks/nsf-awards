 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goals of this research are an enhanced understanding                of how organic compounds respond to aqueous alteration and the                  relation of this response to the observed distribution of organic               compounds in petroleum, oil-field brines, low-grade metamorphic                 rocks and hydrothermal fluids.  These objectives will be met by                 computing the relative stabilities of organic compounds in                      coexisting gas, aqueous, petroleum and disseminated phases, and                 using these calculations to help interpret field, analytical and                experimental observations.  Relative stabilities will be                        evaluated from thermodynamic data as functions of temperature,                  pressure, fugacities of various gases (O2, H2, CO2, CH4, NH3,                   N2, H2O, etc.), and activities of organic and inorganic aqueous                 species.  Where experimental data are not available, existing                   estimation methods will be used.  In the case of aqueous species,               these methods will be enhanced to account for a variety of                      organic compounds (branched and cycloalkanes, polycyclic                        aromatics, dicarboxylic acids, sulfur-bearing compounds, etc.)                  which have not yet received attention, and for which high                       temperature/pressure data are generally not available.  The                     geologic focus of this research will be conditions at which                     aqueous solutions interact with organic compounds in petroleum                  reservoirs, sedimentary rocks, hydrothermal systems and                         metamorphic terranes.  This research requires an                                interdisciplinary approach combining theoretical equations,                     thermodynamics and kinetic data, computer techniques and field                  and laboratory observations to achieve these goals.",
