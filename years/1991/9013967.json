 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in genetics                      between Dr. Stuart Austin, Advanced Bioscience Laboratories,                    Inc., Frederick, Maryland and  Professor Kurt Nordstrom,                        Department of Microbiology, University of Uppsala.  The                         objective of the proposed project is a study of the dynamics                    of plasmid partitioning in bacteria and of partition-specific                   incompatibility.                                                                                                                                                Low-copy-number plasmids are responsible for many economically                  important phenomena, such as drug resistance and bacterial                      pathogenicity.  In addition to highly accurate replication                      controls the plasmids are subject to a partition mechanism                      that, at least superficially, resembles mitosis in eukaryotic                   cells.  Using components of two model systems, the plasmids                     R1 and P1 of Escherichia coli, the investigators seek to                        understand how partition is accomplished, and how the                           partition systems are integrated into an overall strategy                       which ensures the remarkable fidelity with which these                          plasmids are maintained in nature.  The collaborative effort                    will focus on the question of how plasmid copies are recognized                 for partition and, to this end, will concentrate on studies                     of the distribution of plasmid copies in situations where two                   plasmids are competing with each other during key events in                     the cell-cycle (partition-mediated incompatibility). They                       will also develop a theoretical treatment of plasmid distribu-                  tion based on existing and new models for plasmid maintenance                   and on their detailed knowledge of the characteristics of the                   replication systems of these plasmids.  Dr. Austin and                          Nordstrom are leading investigators in the field of plasmid                     biology  and their combined expertise is an important factor                    in the successful outcome of this project.  The results of                      this research are expected to yield data that can significantly                 advance understanding of the mechanisms of P1 and R1                            partitioning.",
