 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance understanding of substrate channeling in              metabolism, allosterism in protein function, and the chemistry of               enzyme catalysis.  Three systems will be studied: (1) the bacterial             bienzyme tryptophan synthase complexes, (2) the human liver alcohol             dehydrogenases, and (3) the sheep liver aldehyde dehydrogenase.                 The tryptophan synthase bienzyme complex catalyzes two sequential               steps in a metabolic pathway; the enzyme exhibits ligand-mediated               allosteric interactions between the . and \u001a sites, which are                    connected by a 25 A-long tunnel.  It is postulated that the common              metabolite indole is transferred between these sites via the                    tunnel.  This proposal will investigate:  (a) the significance of               the tunnel in metabolite transfer, (b) the mechanism and function               of the allosteric effects, and (c) the chemical determinants of                 substrate specificity.  Through genetic engineering, the human                  liver alcohol dehydrogenase isozymes are available in large                     amounts.  This proposal will determine the roles played by protein              conformation change and by electrostatic fields in hydride                      transfer.  The aldehyde dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation of                    aldehydes occurs via an acyl-enzyme intermediate.  How the                      oxidation state of bound coenzyme influences the properties of the              acyl-enzyme will be studied.  Rapid kinetic techniques,                         chromophoric substrates or analogues, and 1-H NMR will be used.                 Some of the tryptophan synthase and alcohol dehydrogenase work will             involved studies of mutant enzymes prepared by site-directed                    mutagenesis.",
