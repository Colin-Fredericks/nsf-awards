 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Neuroscience and Behavior                      Program at the University of Massachusetts to establish a                       Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site.  This program will                take advantage of a unique neuroscience community that exists in                this regional site.  Neuroscientists at each of five colleges in                the Amherst area are members of the University of Massachusetts                 Neuroscience and Behavior Program (NSB).  This program will bring               undergraduates into a laboratory environment  where they will                   become members of a research team.  This approach will facilitate               the development of mentor-protege relationships, which may have a               profound and long-lasting affect on career choices.  The Program                will consist of an eight-week research project in one of the                    laboratories.  The laboratory work is designed to introduce                     students to one of the three specialty areas in neuroscience                    represented in the NSB Program; Learning and Behavior                           Neuroendocrinology, and Neurodevelopment.  In addition to their                 laboratory work, students will attend a series of weekly                        workshops designed to provide an overview of neuroscience by                    introducing the knowledge and technology of laboratories outside                the one in which the student works.  In this way REU students                   will become familiar with a broad segment of neuroscience and                   thus be better prepared to choose careers in the neurosciences.                 The REU program will be followed up by encouraging work in the                  home institutions.                                                                                                                                              Qualified undergraduates will be recruited from the five local                  institutions as well as from the national undergraduate                         population.  The program will focus special attention on                        recruiting groups that are under-represented in science - women                 and minorities.  In addition, personal contacts with faculty at a               number of institutions with large minority populations have                     agreed to help identify qualified minority undergraduates for                   the program.  Since the REU faculty is made up of 28% women and                 minorities, appropriate role models and mentors will be available               for all participants.",
