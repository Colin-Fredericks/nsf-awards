 "awd_abstract_narration": "Segregation distorter (SD) is a naturally occurring meiotic drive               system on the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster.                     Heterozygous SD/SD+ males transmit the SD chromosome in vast excess             over the normal homolog.  The basis of the distorted transmission               involves the induced dysfunction of the spermatids the receive the              SD+ chromosome but the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown.               The SD system comprises at least three distinct loci: Sd, E(SD) and             Rsp.  Our long term goals have been to characterize these loci with             the aim of elucidating the structure, function, and origin of SD                chromosomes.  Molecular analysis of Sd indicates that it is                     associated with a tandem duplication of a normal genomic segment.               The tandem duplication encodes an Sd-specific 4.2 kb transcript.                In addition, the duplication specifies a family of 2 kb transcripts             some or all of which are also present in Sd+.  Sequence analysis                of Sd and Sd+ cDNAs reveals that most members of the 2 kb family                share the same ORF.  cDNAs corresponding to the 4.2 kb transcript               have not yet been identified.  Our data suggest that the neomorphic             phenotype of Sd results from expression of a novel fusion protein               or from the ectopic or overexpression of a normal (Sd+) protein.                To elucidate the molecular nature of Sd in greater detail we                    propose to: isolate and characterize cDNAs corresponding to the 4.2             kb transcript; use anchored PCR techniques to characterize the                  complete set of transcripts in the 2 kb family and to compare this              array in SD and SD+ with emphasis on identifying any transcripts                that may be Sd-specific or expressed preferentially in testes;                  raise antisera against the common ORF for Western blot and                      immunolocalization analysis of Sd and Sd+ polypeptides;a nd isolate             and characterize Sd+ null mutations.  Insight into the segregation-             distortion system should enhance our understanding of a fundamental             genetic mechanism, meiotic drive.  But it is also clear that such               an understanding could be of great practical use in designing gene              vectors which have an insertion advantage.",
