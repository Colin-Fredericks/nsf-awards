 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a collaborative effort between the Oregon                      Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) and the Oregon Science                    Teachers Association (OSTA) designed to enhance K-8 science                     through two major initiatives: 1) a ten month teacher-in-                       residence (TIR) program at the Museum that will utilize a                       sabbatical-leave staff development design (4 teachers/year                      for a total of 12 over three years), and 2) a two-week (60-                     80 hours) Summer Institute for K-8 Oregon teachers (30/year                     for a total of 90 over three years) conducted by project                        staff and TIRs; the Institute program will incorporate TIRs'                    experiences of the past year at the Museum and will utilize                     Museum facilities and professional support.  As part of the                     their sabbatical application to participate in the Teacher-                     in-Residence plan, prospective TIRs will be expected to                         develop with their administrators a dissemination plan for                      their home school districts.                                                                                                                                    This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because it (1) is designed to enhance the science                       knowledge and teaching of leader teachers through a year-                       long emersion in the informal science environment of a                          museum as well as through academic courses in science                           content and methodology; (2) contains an amplification plan                     which will involve the TIRs both in a summer institute for                      30 teachers from throughout the state, and in ongoing                           support within their districts throughout the year; and (3)                     serves as a model for an alternative and innovative means to                    teacher enhancement in K-8 science education.                                                                                                                   The non-NSF cost sharing amount is approximately 26% of the                     amount requested from NSF.",
