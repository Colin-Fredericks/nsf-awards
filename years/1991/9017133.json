 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many jurisdictions the Uniform Building                                      Code, UBC (ICBO, 1988), regulates the design                                    for lateral wind and seismic forces.                                            However, most architecture students and                                         architecture design firms find these                                            regulations difficult to interpret and apply                                    for multi-story buildings.  Therefore,                                          lateral design is often not considered in the                                   early design process as it should be when                                       important decisions are made that affect                                        lateral forces.                                                                                                                                                 This proposal makes lateral design simpler                                      and more transparent, visualizes effects of                                     building form on lateral forces, and                                            facilitates trade-off studies for creative                                      integration in the early design process.  The                                   project will:  1) develop a computer program                                    for lateral design by means of tables and                                       graphs, and 2) develop paper graphs for use                                     without a computer.  No such graphs have been                                   available to architects in designing for                                        lateral forces.                                                                                                                                                 This project will fill in this gap by                                           allowing architects and students of                                             architecture to consider earthquake resistant                                   design in the early stages of building                                          design.  As such, the proposed products                                         resulting from this project will have a                                         direct application to the earthquake                                            resistant design process at an early stage.                                     It is very timely.",
