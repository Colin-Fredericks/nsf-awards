 "awd_abstract_narration": "The progression of activated (G1-phase) T cells into S-phase, and               ultimately, mitosis is initiated by the binding of the T cell-                  derived growth factor, interleukin 2 (IL2) to high affinity cell                surface receptors.  At present, the intracellular pathways involved             in the propagation of mitogenic signals in IL2-stimulated T cells               are unknown.  Although the IL2 receptor does not contain an                     intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain, IL2 receptor                    occupancy stimulates the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins              at tyrosyl residues.  The long-term goal of this project is to                  define the mechanism by which ligand-stimulated IL2 receptors                   initiate and propagate growth-regulatory signals from the plasma                membrane to the nucleus.  The present study will utilize                        homogeneous populations of IL2-responsive, murine and human T cells             to address the following specific aims:  (1) To further define the              interactions of the ligand-bound IL2 receptor with various non-                 receptor PTKs normally expressed in T cells.  (2) To characterize               IL2 receptor signaling functions and growth factor sensitivities                in a panel of T cell clones transfected with genes (p60c-src,                   polyomavirus middle T antigen) whose protein products alter PTK                 activity in these cells.                                                                                                                                        These studies will provide novel insights into the interactions of              receptors for hormone-like \"cytokines\" with non-receptor enzymes,               PTKs, and into the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in                  signal transduction leading to proliferation of specific cells of               the immune system.",
