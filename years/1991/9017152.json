 "awd_abstract_narration": "A remarkable variety of organisms inhabit the Earth.  Regardless                of their phylogenetic position, their survival depends on their                 capacity to adapt to their changing environments.  Environmental                pathogens are a part of that changing milieu.  All animals and many             plants display cell surface glycoproteins that serve in                         discrimination of self from non-self molecules.  This appears to                be a fundamental aspect of living cells and organisms.  In addition             to the ability to discriminate \"self\" from \"foreign\", organisms                 must possess protective mechanisms to contend with the plethora of              potential pathogens and parasites in their environments.  These                 defense responses may involve contact or short-range cell-cell                  interactions, or the synthesis and secretion of defensive molecules             with agglutinating or lytic properties.  The International Society              of Developmental and Comparative Immunologists (ISDCI), which meets             triennially as a Congress, is the only international organization               of investigators dedicated to the study of defense mechanisms in                the diversity of organisms in the greatly disparate phylogenetic                groups inhabiting this planet.   This proposal seeks support for                the Vth International Congress of this society which will be held               August 4-9, 1991 at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.  The exchange             of ideas and data at this international meeting will contribute                 greatly to the advancement of knowledge in this important area.",
