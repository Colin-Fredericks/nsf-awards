 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charged species moving in viscous media move at varying rates                   under the influence of electric fields, dependent on the                        acceleration due to the field competing with the drag of the                    medium.  A device which measures the relative speed of motion                   of different ions is an ion mobility spectrometer.  In this                     research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                     Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. McMinn will use an ion                 mobility spectrometer to identify and quantify trace organic                    species.  The species will be separated from the medium in                      which they are initially found by supercritical fluid                           extraction.  The work will be performed largely by                              undergraduates.                                                                                                                                                 Selectivity for organic species will be achieved both by                        varying the properties of the supercritical fluid used for                      extraction and by varying the parameters of the ion mobility                    spectrometer.  This two-dimensional approach will give enhanced                 selectivity compared to either method alone.  Both                              supercritical fluid extraction and ion mobility spectrometry                    are relatively new techniques.  Thus, their combination will                    afford types of separations and specific analytical methods                     heretofore unexplored.",
