 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emanuel proposes a three-part study of tropical cyclone                    dynamics: a) A field experiment, to test a simple hypothesis that               tropical cloud clusters are \"triggered\" to \"ignition\" (cyclogen-                esis) only if the mid-tropospheric source air for small-scale                   convective downdrafts in the vicinity of the disturbance's                      center becomes warm/moist enough to set up a downdraft-surface                  layer-cloud updraft cycle that results in a continually warmer                  and/or moister downdraft source layer. The field experiment is                  required because neither conventional past observations nor                     numerical models resolve the spatial or temporal detail needed to               test the hypothesis.  b) A set of analyses of past hurricanes to                see whether cyclone initiation is also accompanied by the                       approach of an upper-level flow system with  a locally high                     measure of combined cyclonic rotation and thermal instability, so               that it lines up over a similar low-level area generated by                     clusters of tropical rain showers c) Generalization of the                      current  barotropic (one-layer) theory of steering of mature                    hurricanes by the ambient large scale flow, by constructing a                   simple two-layer (baroclinic) model. Although it has consistently               been observed that the vertical shear of the ambient flow of                    tropical cyclones is weak at best, Emanuel argues that the                      cyclones themselves have pronounced vertical structure, with the                lower tropospheric cyclone overlain by a more anticyclonic vorti-               city center.                                                                         The third study will improve our understanding of the                      factors governing hurricane movement. The first two should                      provide more information on the perennial question as to why so                 few tropical oceanic rain systems eventually develop into mature                tropical cyclones.",
