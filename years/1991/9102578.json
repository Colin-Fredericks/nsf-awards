 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object-oriented paradigm has the potential to revolutionize the             construction of software.  The goal of this research is to develop,             formalize and provide tools for abstractions which are useful for               working with groups of classes.  Abstractions which have already been           formalized and whose value has already been proven include modules              (sometimes called clusters), class dictionary graphs, class                     dictionaries, etc.  This project is to investigate at least two                 additional abstractions which have considerable potential: Propagation          Patterns and Contracts.  Mathematical models for object-oriented                software engineering will be developed along with the necessary                 algorithms and tools.  The research involves both general principles,           which are applicable to any object oriented programming effort, and             implementation in the Demeter system, which allows the evaluation of            tools and their interaction with other sophisticated methods.",
