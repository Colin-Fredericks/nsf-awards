 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigators will work                      separately and jointly on a number of interesting problems in                   Fourier Analysis.  Among the specific topics to be considered are               the following:  rearrangements of orthogonal systems of                         functions, the metrical properties of Besicovitch sets in higher                dimensions and their relationship to the Bochner-Riesz                          summability of Fourier series, and the distributional properties                of Dirichlet sums.  Each of these topics has a long and venerable               history in classical analysis, and the principal investigators                  are in the forefront of mathematicians working on improving our                 understanding of Fourier series.                                                     Fourier series arise in a host of pure and applied contexts,               and it is not an exaggeration to say that their study has                       provided much of the motivation for twentieth-century analysis.                 The principal investigators in this project are two of the                      greatest analysts in the world today, and they propose to study                 some challenging questions regarding the properties of Fourier                  series and the functions defined by them.",
