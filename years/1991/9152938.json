 "awd_abstract_narration": "Equipment is being utilized for the development of a two-                       semester introductory level laboratory course entitled                          \"Discovering Physics.\"  The course emphasizes an understanding                  of the basic concepts that naturally lead us to ask \"How do we                  know...?\" and \"Why do we believe...?\" questions about physical                  phenomena.  The story lines of \"What is light?\" and \"What is                    randomness?\" are utilized for their general interest, their                     accessibility, and their importance in physics.  The course is                  oriented toward students planning to become elementary school                   teachers, adopts the same teaching philosophy that should be                    used in the elementary school classroom, and has a fifty                        percent enrollment of female students.  The laboratory                          emphasizes a cooperative learning environment and encourages                    students to develop hypotheses and to propose and perform                       experiments that generate real data and experiences.  Funds are                 being utilized to purchase and construct more sophisticated                     equipment that will yield quantitative results, reduce one                      layer of student confusion, and allow further experiments                       related to electro-magnetic radiation, nonlinear phenomena, and                 chaos.  Since there are no available textbooks for a course of                  this type, project staff are producing a university-level                       modular-based Discovery Workbook.  The proposed project is                      strengthening the laboratory based course at Clark University                   and having national impact.NSF grant funds are being matched                    with funds from non-federal sources.",
