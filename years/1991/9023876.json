 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the                     University of Hawaii will acquire several items of oceano-                      graphic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use                    equipment.  This equipment is maintained for use on or in                       association with the research vessels and facilities operated                   by the University.  A large part of the ships' operating                        schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research                    projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the                           capabilities of the ship and of the University to support                       research and engineering activities.  The instrumentation                       includes:                                                                                                                                                       -Newly developed Continuous Profiling System that will                           provide a range of environmental data at a long-term                            offshore sampling site,                                                        -Shipboard computer upgrade and optical data recording device                    for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing capabilities,                   -precision graphic recorder for displaying acoustically                          derived data of seafloor bathymetry and sedimentary                             profiles, and                                                                  -precision audio frequency signal source for calibrating and                     testing seagoing acoustic instruments.                                                                                                                         The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored                           research and engineering projects.",
