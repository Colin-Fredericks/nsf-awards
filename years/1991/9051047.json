 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past, the photographic plate provided the data for most of               optical astronomy.  Undergraduate students in astronomy                         laboratory classes were, therefore, introduced to equipment like                measuring engines and iris photometers.  Now, however, most                     detectors are electronic.  Most astronomical data resides in                    digital form and a new set of analytical tools has replaced the                 old.  Improved access to these new tools by our undergraduate                   students will be provided.                                                                                                                                      The Department has recently increased its emphasis on laboratory-               based training so that students at all levels have exposure to the              trials of real data.  Newly-implemented laboratory courses                      concentrate not just on the analysis of data.  Rather, the                      students learn to collect data and to understand what the data can              yield as well as appreciate its limitations.  The Astronomy Program             Review Committee, appointed by the Chancellor to conduct a five-                year review, strongly recommended that the laboratory programs of               the department be continued and, even strengthened.                                                                                                             The Department has recently upgraded its student observing                      facilities at the Leuschner Observatory, which include remote                   observing capabilities.  An aggressive upgrading of on campus                   facilities with and emphasis on image processing as the tool of                 modern astronomy will be carried out.  Students will be provided                with the opportunity to gather their own observational data at the              student observatory, to analyze it quantitatively, to draw their                own conclusions and to understand the uncertainties.                                                                                                            The concentration on image processing has many benefits: first of               all, it is intuitive; people are visual creatures and the                       extraction of quantitative data from pictures presents few                      conceptual difficulties.  Secondly, it is applicable to a wide                  range of astronomical problems in all wavelength regions.                       Lastly, it has applications which go far beyond astronomical uses.",
