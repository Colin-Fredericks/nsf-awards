 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on the environmental                       reduction of chromium from the hexavalent to the trivalent                      state by contact with mineral and humic substances in                           soil, a reduction process that can be influenced by                             interactions with aqueous ions, electron transfers at                           mineral surfaces, reaction with simple organic molecules                        or by interactions with soil humic substances.  This                            research involves determination of the oxidation-reduction                      processes that affect the transport and fate of hexavalent                      chromium in soil as influenced by ionic strength and                            background electrolytes.                                                                                                                                        Results are expected to be used in the development of                           mathematical models that characterize the process by which                      chromium is chemically reduced and physically transformed                       to a less environmentally damaging form.  Chromium is an                        important industrial metal that finds its way into surface                      and groundwaters by leakage from waste management sites.                        The results of this project are expected to be used in                          development of models and techniques that can be used in                        planning the engineering design of remediation measures                         that can be used to reduce the pollutional impact of                            chromium discharges on surface and groundwater.",
