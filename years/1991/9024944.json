 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimization can contribute significantly both to on-                           line control and to the design of linear and nonlinear                          controllers.  In the form of receding horizon control,                          it has the potential, not easily provided by other                              methods, to stabilize linear and nonlinear systems                              with state and control constraints.  When employed                              in an interactive, optimization-based design                                    environment, it enables control systems to be                                   designed to achieve the diverse, possibly conflicting,                          objectives that typify engineering design.                                                                                                                      The purpose of this research is twofold.  Firstly, it                           will endeavour to provide a firm basis for the use of                           receding horizon control by a comprehensive program                             of research aimed at:  (i) reducing substantially the                           on-line computational demands made by existing,                                 stabilizing receding horizon controllers, (ii)                                  developing receding horizon observers for use when                              the state is not accessible, (iii) developing adaptive                          receding horizon control for the case when the plant                            is unknown, and (iv) exploring the use of                                       optimization-based design to achieve these objectives.                                                                                                          Secondly, it aims to improve computational tools for                            optimization-based design by research on:  (i) semi-                            infinite optimization, (ii) global optimization, (iii)                          semi-infinite global optimization, and, (iv) simple,                            robust optimal control algorithms for use in receding                           horizon control.",
