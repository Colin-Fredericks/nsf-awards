Argentina is an example of a nation                   that has had many of the resources necessary for robust                         industrial development in the twentieth century.  Argentina's                   development process was thwarted, however, thereby calling into                 question current knowledge about processes of industrialization                 and regional development.  This doctoral dissertation project                   will examine the development of the capital-goods industries of                 Mendoza, Argentina.  In-depth interviews with chief executive                   officers of capital-goods firms will be conducted to uncover the                origins, evolution, and current form of industrial governance                   systems.  Information also will be collected about the material,                information, and financial linkages among firms and local,                      national, and international economies.  These interviews will be                validated and complemented by data gathered from existing                       manufacturing surveys, public and nongovernmental industrial                    sector reports, economic censuses, and information from                         interviews with chief executive officers from other firms linked                to the capital-goods enterprises in Mendoza province.                                                                                                                This project will provide valuable information about and                   analyses of processes of industrialization and regional                         development in Third World settings.  This project also will                    provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to               continue to develop independent research skills.",
