 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Knight is supported by a grant from the Experimental                  Physical Chemistry Program to study chemical reaction products                  generated under high energy pulsed laser vaporization                           conditions using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy.                    Scientific knowledge obtained from these studies could be                       important in several areas including silicon deposition                         processes involved in the fabrication of microelectronic                        components and identification of reactive intermediates                         involved in upper atmospheric chemistry.  This research is done                 in collaboration with undergraduate students in chemistry who                   gain experience with lasers, high vacuum technology, ESR                        spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and spectral simulations, all                  of which provide good preparation for careers in science and                    engineering.                                                                                                                                                    Cation, anion and neutral radicals are produced by pulsed laser                 vaporization, the radicals are identified by time-of-flight                     mass spectroscopy, and are trapped in a neon matrix at 4 K.                     Many new molecular radical ions are being generated and                         characterized for the first time in Prof. Knight's laboratory.                  The electron spin resonance spectra obtained have linewidths                    which are comparable to those in the gas phase and allow the                    determination of hyperfine structure as well as g values.                       Hyperfine parameters are extremely sensitive to the electronic                  wavefunction and hence provide stringent tests of ab initio                     theoretical calculations which are being carried out in                         collaboration with several theoretical groups.",
