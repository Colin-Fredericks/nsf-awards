 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of this research is to develop adequate                 principles for dealing with uncertainty in expert systems.  The                 focus is on four relatively new mathematical theories of                        uncertainty: possibility theory, fuzzy set theory, random set                   theory, and the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence.  In each of                 these theories, as in probability theory, well-justified                        functions that measure uncertainty are now well established.                    These functions are crucial for the following three principles of               uncertainty to be investigated: principles of maximum                           uncertainty, minimum uncertainty, and uncertainty invariance.                   According to the principle of maximum uncertainty, conclusions in               any form of ampliative reasoning are determined by maximizing                   relevant uncertainty function subject to constraints that                       represent information available. The principle of minimum                       uncertainty is fundamental to a variety of problems involving                   unavoidable increase of relevant uncertainty, such as                           simplification or conflict-resolution problems.  According to                   this principle, solutions are determined by minimizing relevant                 uncertainty function within constraints representing the                        requirements of each problem.  The principle of uncertainty                     invariance is concerned with information-preserving                             transformations between distinct theories of uncertainty.  This                 project is developing mathematical and computational foundation                 of the three principles as well as investigating their practical                role in expert systems.",
