 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from both the Organic Dynamics Program, Division                   of Chemistry and the Solid State Chemistry and Polymers                         Program, Division of Materials Research, Dr. Walba will study                   the design, synthesis, and characterization of ferroelectric                    liquid crystals (FLC), a new class of thermodynamically stable,                 ordered organic materials. The targets of the synthetic effort                  are designed to possess useful properties for photonic devices,                 e.g., fast-switching, high resolution and high contrast FLC                     light valves and ultrafast nonlinear optical devices. Specific                  projects include the following: (i) synthesis of chiral                         fluorinated alkylbenzoates and atropisomeric FLCs and                           evaluation of their FLC properties; (ii) synthesis and evalua-                  tion of the nonlinear optical properties of new FLC films;                      (iii) empirical force field modelling of FLC components (i.e.,                  computerization of the binding site model); (iv) polarization-                  sensitive IR spectroscopic studies of the FLC self assembly in                  thin films.                                                                                                                                                     While the powerful techniques of regio- and sterocontrolled                     organic synthesis and conformational analysis give considerable                 control over the constitution and spatial relationships between                 atoms in organic molecules, the directed design of new                          materials (i.e., molecular aggregates) with specific geometric                  relationships between functional arrays of atoms is an exciting                 frontier in chemistry. An important goal of this project takes                  advantage of the self-assembly that occurs in ferroelectric                     liquid crystals (FLCs) to create in a controlled and general                    manner organic materials that possess thermodynamically stable                  polar order. With this objective in mind, a simple                              stereochemical model for the molecular level origins of the                     polar order that occurs in FLCs is developed and tested via a                   program of research that focusses upon the design,                              synthesis, and characterization of new FLC materials.",
