 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased concern about global environmental change in recent years          has highlighted the need for social scientific research on the human            dimensions of global environmental change in addition to analyses by            natural and physical scientists.  A number of organizations have                addressed issues related to research needs and opportunities with               respect to this topic; foremost among those groups has been the Social          Science Research Council (SSRC).  Since its establishment in 1989, the          SSRC's Committee for Research on Global Environmental Change has                organized interdisciplinary consortiums to conduct research on critical         problems, sponsored workshops and conferences to bring together                 scientists, developed plans for dissertation, fellowship, and summer            study programs, and coordinated U.S. research activities with those of          other organizations, including the International Social Science Council         (ISSC), the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the             International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), and the           Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).        This award will continue core support for the SSRC Committee for                Research on Global Environmental Change for two additional years.  The          committee expects to continue establishment of interdisciplinary                research consortiums.  Among the research topics under current                  consideration are comparative examinations of landed property rights and        the adoption of technological innovations.  The committee also will             continue to develop plans for and to implement innovative new forms of          support for education, including doctoral dissertation and post-doctoral        fellowship programs.  These and other specific efforts of the committee         will be supported with funds raised from other sources.                            Through its ongoing work, the SSRC Committee for Research on Global          Environmental Change will continue to identify important research               problems related to the human dimensions of global environmental change         that require analyses by social scientists.  It will help bring together        scientists from many different disciplines to address important                 conceptual and methodological issues, and it will help organize                 interdisciplinary collaboratives to conduct research.  Through                  workshops, conferences, and other forums, the committee will continue to        attract attention to these important issues, and through new educational        programs, it will enable more social scientists to develop necessary            research skills and expertise.",
