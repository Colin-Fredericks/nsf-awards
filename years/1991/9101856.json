 "awd_abstract_narration": "The upper atmosphere depart significantly from radiative                   equilibrium and have a circulation and thermal structure that                   appear to be mostly due to forcing by small-scale gravity wave                  motion.  Although this region of the atmosphere exhibits a large                number of interesting aeronomical phenomena, it is the least                    understood region of the earth's atmosphere.  Detailed studies of               chemical and dynamical coupling in the upper atmosphere and lower               thermosphere thus have been identified as one major component of                the NSF CEDAR program.                                                               Gravity wave parameters are useful for understanding the                   dynamics in this region.  A collection of various CEDAR                         instruments such as lidar, optical, and radar systems, is                       required in order to improve  our knowledge of gravity waves and                turbulence field.  Such a collection, including the PIs' airglow                spectrometer, participated in  a CEDAR supported campaign,                      Airborne Lidar and Observations of the Hawaiian Airglow (ALOHA),                which was successfully conducted in March and April of 1990.  The               participating experiments included groundbased airglow imagers                  and interferometers at Haleaukala Observatory, SAD and meteor                   radars at Christmas Island, a Na temperature lidar and meteor                   radar in Colorado, and airglow spectrometers onboard the NCAR                   Electra along with a Na lidar.  This proposal requests support to               analyze the data obtained by the Michigan airglow spectrometer                  onboard the Electra and to interpret the airglow results with                   additional information from those obtained by the other                         instruments.",
