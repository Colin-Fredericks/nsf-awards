 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on processes and                           systems that produce multivariate data and are subject to                       changes in performance, some of which are upsetting and                         that may be avoided or better dealt with if they could be                       anticipated.  The statistical method for classifying upset                      conditions termed \"discriminate upset prediction\" involves                      use of current measurements as predictors of future                             conditions rather than using them only to characterizing                        the current state.  The discriminate upset prediction                           process involves finding the parameter or parameters that                       best characterize a future upset condition and which may                        therefore serve to activate responsive measures to avoid                        the upset.                                                                                                                                                      Preliminary feasibility studies involving a suspended                           growth biological wastewater treatment process and the                          operation of a waste disposal facility have been                                conducted.  The possibility of being able to predict a                          future upset in a process operating normally by examining                       current operating records would be of great value in                            assuring consistent and reliable operation of facilities                        that affect environmental quality.  Results from this                           research may be applied in engineering design relating to                       the operation of treatment processes for water and                              wastewater treatment, other environmental engineering                           applications and manufacturing, in general.",
