 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the development of students' schemes for                  multiplication and multiplicative rate of change that will enable               students to understand the crucial societal and environmental issues of         exponential growth.  Through the use of teaching experiments, historical        analysis and the design of software incorporating new representational          and visual forms, the research team seeks to investigate how to improve         students' insight in issues of scale, functions, multiplicative rate of         change and biological forms of growth.  To facilitate the research on           secondary students, preliminary work will be undertaken into young              children's concepts of multiplication, similarity and growth in relation        to a primitive construct labelled \"splitting\" which is conjectured to be        the basis of an approach to multiplication independent of counting.             Initial studies will also include an ethnomathematical investigation of         scientists' and social scientists' use of exponential functions.                Informed by the interview studies, research on whole classroom                  implementation will be undertaken towards the preparation of applied            research products including curricula, case studies of teacher                  development and software products.",
