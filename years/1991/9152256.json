 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has the goal of improving the introductory physics                 laboratory courses taken by scientists and engineers.  The                      physics department is replacing the computer-based data-                        acquisition and analysis equipment used in these courses so                     that students learn to use general purpose computer data-                       acquisition hardware, general purpose data-acquisition                          software, data analysis software based on a spreadsheet, and                    report preparation software as part of a first semester general                 physics laboratory course.  Having acquired the ability to use                  these and other essential laboratory tools, students use these                  general purpose tools and work more independently in the second                 semester laboratory course.  This two semester laboratory                       course sequence builds on student knowledge of computer                         hardware and software; it also prepares students for upper                      division laboratory courses and for research participation.                     The major software package used is LabVIEW, a graphic based                     language which allows students to easily program the computer                   interface to deal with each experimental problem.NSF grant                      funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
