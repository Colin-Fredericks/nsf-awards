 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences is unique in its                 focus on marine phytoplankton, the microscopic floating plants that             form the base of the food chain in the world's oceans.  The Lab is              actively used by resident and visiting scientists.  Dr. Maureen                 Keller is a resident scientists at the Lab, and she has embarked                on an ambitious plan to expand the Lab's ability to grow                        phytoplankton in the laboratory under carefully controlled                      conditions.  These new lab facilities proposed by Dr. Keller would              facilitate novel research into the growth and physiology of marine              plankton, and would allow culturing of polar species at Bigelow Lab             for the first time.                                                                  The proposed expansion of the Bigelow Lab's culturing facility             would accommodate more research projects and would facilitate new               avenues of research.  This expansion would establish a unique                   capability for controlled temperature culturing down to polar                   conditions, and would increase the impact of the Lab's other                    facilities, such as a recently acquired transmission electron                   microscope and an important reference collection of marine                      phytoplankton.",
