 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to introduce modern instruments                  and technology into the Engineering Technology curriculum and                   to allow development of new ways of using modern instruments to                 provide improved instructional capabilities.  The data-                         acquisition systems consist of an AT-class computer and                         associated boards and software.  External assemblies containing                 conditioning and protection devices are accessible for student                  experimentation.  The equipment is used in the                                  computer/electronic labs and the mechanical engineering                         technology laboratories.  The electronic/computer engineering                   technology students learn how to select and install data                        acquisition systems, how to program them at all levels, how to                  reduce and analyze data obtained, and how to interface external                 devices of all kinds.  The mechanical engineering technology                    students use the equipment to perform measurements and for data                 analysis and reduction, which can be done at a much higher                      level of sophistication utilizing the available software.",
