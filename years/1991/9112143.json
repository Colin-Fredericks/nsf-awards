 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estonia is an uncommonly appropriate setting for study of                  attitude change, life course patterns, and inter-ethnic attitudes               and contact.  Since the nineteenth century, Estonia has been in the             forefront of social change in the Russian Empire (until 1920) and               in the Soviet Union (since 1940).  In the late nineteenth century,              the provinces that become Estonia and Latvia were the only parts                of the Russian Empire in which there was evidence of voluntary                  fertility control in rural areas.  Currently, the population of                 Estonia has the highest educational level of any republic in the                Soviet Union.  Depending on the indicator used, either Estonia or               Latvia has the highest standard of living within the Soviet Union.              Gorbachev has used Estonia as a test case for some aspects of                   perestroika.  It could be argued that if perestroika could not work             in Estonia, it could not work anywhere.  Social changes in Estonia              have often foreshadowed changes elsewhere in the Soviet Union.                  Thus, examination of attitutde change in Estonia can throw light                on future developments elsewhere in the Soviet Union and also                   provide a useful comparison to changes now occurring in Eastern                 Europe. In addition, Estonia has a long tradition of survey                     research by sociologists.  This project investigates continuity and             change in social and political life in contemporary Estonia through             analysis of a re-interview household survey jointly planned,                    designed, and directed by the U.S. and Estonian scholars involved               with this project and conducted in 1991.  The new survey updates                the content of the initially administered 1979 questionnaire and                adds items that will facilitate international comparisons and allow             testing of hypotheses from the current sociological and comparative             politics literatures.  Specifically, it focuses on life course                  issues relating education, marriage, childbearing, labor force                  participation and career advancement; and on intra-generational                 change in social and political attitudes from the Brezhnev to the               Gorbachev period and the process of inter-generational transmission             of values and attitudes.                                                                                                                                             This project will contribute to our understanding of the                   relations between education, childbearing, and labor force                      participation; political socialization; political participation;                and patterns of regime support and the bases of that support.  This             project will also contribute to the support and strengthening of                the infrastructure of sociological research in Estonia.",
