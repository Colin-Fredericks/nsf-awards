 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine solid/solute                      (absorbent/adsorbate) interactions in supercritical extraction                  from solid matrix through determination of adsorption                           equilibria between dilute supercritical mixtures and well                       characterized solid matrices, using a dynamic tracer response                   technique.  The partial molar volumes of the adsorbate in the                   adsorbent are determined through the isothermal density                         dependence of the solubilities of these solutes in the                          supercritical phase (date from the literature) combined with                    the isothermal density dependence of the adsorption                             equilibrium constants which are measured.  Similarly, the                       heats of adsorption are determined from the isobaric                            temperature dependence of the adsorption equilibrium                            constants.  Employing the data, a thermodynamic model for                       adsorbate/adsorbent interactions in presence of a                               supercritical fluid will be developed.                                                                                                                          In addition to the adsorption equilibria, the transport and                     hydrodynamic parameters for supercritical extraction from                       solid matrices are studied.  Together with the adsorption                       equilibrium constant, analysis of the tracer response data                      also yields the axial dispersion coefficient, the mass                          transfer coefficient, and the effective diffusivity of the                      solute in the pores of the solid matrix at the extraction                       conditions.  A model is proposed for restrictive diffusion in                   porous particles (effective diffusivity) in presence of                         supercrtical fluids in terms of the particle morphology,                        molecular diffusivity, and the ratio of the diffusing molecule                  diameter to the pore diameter:  The results have implications                   for removal of pollutants from solid adsorbents, for complex                    mixtures separations and analysis, and for extraction of heat-                  sensitive chemicals in the food and fragrance industries.",
