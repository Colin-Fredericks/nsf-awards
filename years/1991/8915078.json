 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in antarctic paleobotany to be                     conducted by Thomas and Edith Taylor of Ohio State University                   in cooperation with Sergio Archangelsky of the Argentine                        Museum of Natural Sciences in Buenos Aires.  The work is an                     extension of a study of Permian plants from the Transantarctic                  Mountains, Antarctica.  It will continue cooperative work on                    fossil floras from Patagonia by examining Permian floras in                     the field and in the laboratory.  Field work will include                       collection of fossil plants and examination of the depositional                 environment and paleoecology of the fossil sites.  The data                     will be compared with similar data gathered on Permian sites                    in Antarctica during the 1988-1989 and 1989-1990 field                          seasons.  Utilizing detailed information about field                            relationships and floral composition, it will be possible to                    correlate biostratigraphy of these two areas.                                                                                                                   The research outlined in this proposal represents a colla-                      borative program designed to examine fossil plants of Permian                   age from southern Argentina and Antarctica.  The U.S.                           component (Taylor and Taylor) have expertise in collections                     obtained from sites in Antarctica.  Their Argentine colleagues                  (Archangelsky, Cuneo and Andreis) have expertise with Permian                   plants and depositional environments from Patagonia.  This                      program provides a unique opportunity to interface these two                    data sets and to provide a synergistic evaluation of Permian                    floras from this sector of Gondwana.  Correlations between                      these floras and those from other Gondwana continents are                       important in understanding biogeographic factors such as                        floral migration and evolution, as well as being indispensable                  in developing biostratigraphic charts.",
