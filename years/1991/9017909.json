These assumptions ignore the effects of                 fault shape, the earth's surface, frictional anisotropy, and the                proximity to nearby faults, any of which could result in a                      significant difference between the direction of resolved shear                  stress and the direction of fault slip.  Mechanical modeling of                 common fault geometries using existing computer code DIS3D provides             a means to evaluate the magnitude of this difference.  The goal is              to distinguish those geological circumstances under which existing              stress-inversion techniques are reliable, from those that give                  unreliable answers.  The results will provide new and important                 insights concerning fault behavior.",
