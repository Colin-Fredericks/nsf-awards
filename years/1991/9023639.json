 "awd_abstract_narration": "The widespread belief that science and imaginative literature are               \"two cultures,\" incommensurable ways to different kinds of                      knowledge, emerged in the 19th century, breaking up the                         Enlightenment dream if arts and sciences harmoniously progressing               as a joint guide to the perfection of humanity.  Professor                      Joravsky, in his analysis of major writers and scientists in                    France and Russia from the 1860s to the early 20th century is                   attempting to explain the emergent rift between literary and                    scientific culture.  He is using a comparative approach in order                to bring out the interaction between ideas and social context.                  He is illuminating the role of political ideologies by examining                the transformation of positivism from a visionary ideology to a                 limited philosophy of science.  He is paying special attention,                 in this regard, to the problem that the literary imagination                    presents to those of positivist inclination.  Prior to beginning                this grant, the Professor Joravsky has devoted his attention to                 the French side of the comparison.  During the course of this                   grant, he is concentrating on the Russian side and is carrying                  the comparative study to the mid-20th century.",
