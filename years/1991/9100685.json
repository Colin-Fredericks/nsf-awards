Wolf from the                            University of Rochester, and Dr. J. Cooper of the                               University of Colorado, with Drs. G.S. Agarwal, S. Dutta                        Gupta, S. Ravi, and S.P. Tewari of the University of                            Hyderabad in India.  The research will address the                              following areas: lasers without population inversion;                           stimulated dielectronic radiative recombination; nonlinear                      optical phenomena in partially coherent fields;                                 higher-order nonlinearities in the interaction of radiation                     with matter; interaction of atoms with radiation in a                           cavity; four-wave mixing lineshape calculations beyond the                      impact approximation; and quantum noise in phase                                conjugation.  The collaboration will involve three                              three-month visits by the Indian scientists to the U.S. and                     four one-month visits by the U.S. scientists to India.                                                                                                          Scope:  The project continues successful collaboration that                     started between the two groups several years ago.  This                         past collaboration have produced a number of new results in                     theoretical quantum optics which are documented in                              published papers.  The project is of significant interest                       to the U.S. and Indian science, and is well within the                          objectives of the U.S.-Indian Cooperative Science Program.                      This project is being funded under two grants INT-9100685                       to the University of Hyderabad, P.I. Dr. G. S. Agarwal and                      INT-9017532 to the University of Rochester, P.I. Dr. Robert                     Boyd.***",
