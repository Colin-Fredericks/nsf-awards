 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yanai proposes to continue his investigations into three                   related topics on the dynamics of large scale tropical motions                  which focus on their linkage with extratropical disturbances and                with clusters of meso-convective scale cloud systems. First, the                nature of heat sources to the atmosphere induced by the Tibetan                 Plateau and their influence on variations of the Asian monsoon are              to be further diagnosed. Secondly, the interactions of the 30-60                day tropical oscillation and mid-latitude disturbances in the                   global flow are to be further studied. Their differences between El             Nino and non-El Nino years are now to be explored.  Third, the                  roles of downdrafts, mesoscale organization, and vertical wind                  shear in the cloud cluster environment are to be analyzed, to ob-               tain improved statistical representation of the overall thermo-                 dynamic and dynamic effects of convective cloud arrays of varying               types.                                                                               Yanai has long been a leader in the quantitative analysis of               observational data on these topics, and in the conceptual framing               of the results into process descriptions that have been incorpora-              ted into widely used components of numerical weather prediction and             general circulation models. This work should contribute to useful               advances in short-range weather prediction, as well as to a deeper              understanding of longer-term variations of  major features of the               global general circulation.",
