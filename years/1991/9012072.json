 "awd_abstract_narration": "The history of science has taught us always to remember that the                development of a field does not nor cannot occur within an                      intellectual vacuum.  Science by its very nature is a social                    pursuit practiced by men and women who interact not only with their             fellow specialists but with the events of society at large.  Dr.                Schabas is exploring the ways that economists were influenced by                other scientists in the development of their economic theories.                 It is important to note, though this is not the subject of this                 research, that the influence was not only one way.  Economists                  affected the development of other sciences--the most famous example             is the influence of the economist Malthus on the thought of Charles             Darwin.                                                                                                                                                         The issues that Dr. Schabas is exploring under this grant are the               many different uses of concepts of nature in the major economic                 texts from the Physiocrats of the mid-eighteenth century to John                Stuart Mill in the mid-nineteenth century.  More specifically, she              is tracing the gradual retreat from appeals to nature as economists             came to recognize the importance of social institutions in                      structuring the economy and as they came to set human nature apart              from physical nature.   This ongoing \"denaturalization\" of the                  conceptual foundations was part and parcel of the gradual                       secularization of science and the general transformation of                     economics into a science of the mind that came with the Marginal                Revolution of the 1870s.  To develop these themes, Dr. Schabas is               examining these specific topics:  1) John Stuart Mill on the                    natural/artificial distinction;  2) Concepts of nature in the                   economic writings of David Hume and Adam Smith; and 3) The                      privileging of physical nature in the Physiocratic corpus.",
