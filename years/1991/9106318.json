 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three major problems will be studied by Professor Mislow. In the                first project, a quantitative method will be developed to                       determine chirality. This will employ analytical and computational              methods to relate the shape of chiral molecules to the magnitude                of psuedoscalar observables. Two-dimensional models that were                   developed in the past will be extended to three-dimensional                     models. By this means the scope of the concept of prochirality                  will also be enlarged. In the second project, the details of                    enantiomer interconversion will be explored. Two aspects of this                problem will be explored: (i) the relative importance of chiral                 pathways when achiral pathways are also energetically accessible,               and (ii) the possibility of ratchet-type molecular motions. The                 third project will be to develop a system to recognize isomeric                 relationships. This will allow one to recognize structural                      similarities among molecules that are independent of chemical                   functionality and bonding connectivity.                                         %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Kurt Mislow at Princeton University.               The research will be in the general area of stereochemistry, which              is the study of the three-dimensional nature of molecules. Within               this framework, the research will investigate this chirality of                 molecules, which refers to their \"handedness,\" i.e., whether                    molecules have a right or left handed array. Mathematical methods               will be used to determine chirality, which in some instances is                 difficult to identify. In another aspect of this research,                      pathways by which one chiral molecule is converted to its other                 chiral partner will be studied. Finally, a system will be                       developed to recognized molecules that have the same molecular                  composition, but differ in their three-dimensional array.",
