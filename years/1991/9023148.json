 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to improve our methodological                          understanding of how to do generic representative                               organizational surveys.  The few general population private                     sector organizational surveys which have been done and report                   response rates tend to have response (or cooperation)  rates                    significantly lower than the seventy to seventy-five percent                    which is normal for general population surveys of                               individuals.  It is likely that some of the high level of                       non-response in organizational surveys represents the                           application of survey techniques developed for populations of                   individuals to organizations.  The application of survey                        methods to organizations must come to grips with the                            differences between organizations and individuals.                                    The project has two objectives.  The first is to                          evaluate the representativeness of a final sample of                            establishments relative to the population in terms of the                       sources of response bias.  These sources include omissions                      from the sampling frame and non-response to the administered                    survey or to particular items on the survey.  The second goal                   is to develop a theory of organizational survey non-response.                   Once a sampling frame has been constructed, high response                       rates are essential in order to approximate the                                 characteristics of a random sample and to insure population                     representativeness.                                                                    It is anticipated that organizational characteristics                    associated with survey and item non-response will be                            identifiable.  Since,  almost nothing is now known about non-                   response in general organizational samples the probabilities                    of making a significant contribution to survey methodology                      and organizational research appear to be high.",
