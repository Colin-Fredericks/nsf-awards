In light of this,                    the University has supported the development of a Software                      Engineering Curriculum and Laboratory.  This laboratory serves                  as a practicum center of Software Engineering core courses,                     where the curriculum is designed as per the recommendations of                  lEEE.  The laboratory helps Software Engineering majors                         graduated from this program with a thorough knowledge of the                    concepts as well as practical experience.  This project                         provides funds for the partial support of implementing the                      Software Engineering Lab, to purchase the IBM RlSC-6000                         systems, with the university and IBM jointly supported the                      remainder.",
