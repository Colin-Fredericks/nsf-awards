 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two-year collaborative research project between Dr.                   Robert Youngs, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State                         University and Professor Wang Hsiu Hwa, National Pingtung                       Institute of Agriculture supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA                    (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This proposal plans to                   study the relationship between removing moisture from wood                      and developments of microfractures using numerical models and                   laboratory experiments include the determination of stresses                    that develop during early stages of drying redwood and                          Castanopsis carlesli, a Taiwan species resembling red oak in                    structure.                                                                                                                                                      Microfractures are a major problem in wood products.  They                      can greatly reduce the quality of wood and lower the value of                   the wood products, and are a principal source of loss of                        value wood products between the US and Taiwan.  The result                      of this research can provide useful information for                             understanding the development of microfractures in wood and                     wood products and reduce the damage in wood during shipping,                    storage and processing.  This project is jointly supported by                   the NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council.",
