 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a long-term research visit by                           Professor Anca Ralescu, Department of Computer Science,                         University of Cincinnati to the laboratory of Professor                         Michio Sugeno, Department of Systems Science of the Tokyo                       Institute of Technology, Nagatsuta, Japan. They will jointly                    carry out research on three important issues in the field of                    fuzzy logic: (1) fuzzy logic based concept learning from                        examples and counter examples (2) fuzzy syllogistic reasoning                   and its relation to other forms of inference under uncertain,                   incomplete, or not totally reliable data  (3) integrating                       quantitative semantics for knowledge representation as                          proposed by fuzzy logic and symbolic knowledge representation                   paradigm  with enhanced expressive power.                                                                                                                       The project represents an excellent collaboration between the                   Japanese and U.S. scientists.  Professor Ralescu has expertise                  in the management of uncertainty in expert systems.  Professor                  Sugeno is a well-known and established academic who was a                       pioneer in the area of \"fuzzy\" methods. Currently Japan is at                   the forefront in fuzzy theory research and                                      implementation.  At the same time research in the United                        States involving fuzzy logic is minimal.  Results of the                        research could contribute to the spread of fuzzy logic based                    devices into the engineering environment by making it                           possible to build fuzzy logic devices with limited intel-                       ligence.  It may also lead to a large number of commercial                      uses for fuzzy logic in the United States.",
