 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trade Unions and employers' associations vary widely in their                   degree of centralization across the advanced industrial                         democracies.  The sources and economic consequences of the extent               of centralization of such associations have been subjects of                    considerable debate.  While it is clear that the extent of                      centralization has substantial consequences in terms of economic                policies and outcomes, the specific nature of these relationships               is not well understood.                                                                                                                                         This collaborative research explores both the causes and                        consequences of union centralization in advanced industrial                     societies.  Government data and interviews with local experts will              be used to construct a comprehensive data set on the centralization             of national industrial relations systems and of trade unions and                employers' associations in approximately 20 european nations over               an extended time period.  These data will permit a much more                    systematic and thorough exploration of the causes and consequences              of union centralization.                                                                                                                                        When completed this project will provide the basis for a better                 understanding of union, management, government relations and how                they can be improved.",
