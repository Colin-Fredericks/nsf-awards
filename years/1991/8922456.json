 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Ron Neuman, Auburn University, and two Swedish researchers:                     Professor Per Stenius, Institute for Surface Chemistry, and                     Professor Per Martin Claesson, Department of Physical                           Chemistry, The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm.  The                   objective of the project is to investigate the feasibility                      of employing a surface force apparatus for studies of model                     papermaking systems.                                                                                                                                            In particular, the forces between model cellulose surfaces                      will be directly measured to identify and quantify the                          fundamental interactions between cellulose surfaces and other                   surfaces of intrinsic interest and technological importance                     to pulping and papermaking.  Technique development will                         include the preparation of model cellulose and lignin                           surfaces on molecularly smooth mica substrates by the method                    of Langmuir.Blodgett monolayer deposition.  Preliminary                         monolayer experiments will be initiated prior to the visit to                   ensure productive surface force measur\u001aements.  The facilities                  and experience in surface force measurements of the Institute                   Surface Chemistry in Stockholm complement the expertise of                      the principal investigator in surface and colloid chemistry                     of papermaking, monomolecular films, and Langmuir.Blodgett                      monolayer deposition. The results of this research are                          expected to have important applications in the pulp and paper                   industries.",
