Reinforced concrete frames                                                      constructed prior to the 1970's pose                                            one of the greatest hazards for loss                                            of life due to collapse during                                                  strong ground shaking.  One of the                                              key deficiencies of such structures                                             is inadequate proportioning and                                                 detailing of columns.  Examples of                                              deficiencies include insufficient                                               column strength relative to beam                                                strength, light transverse                                                      reinforcement, and short lap                                                    splices.                                                                                                                                                        This research is to conduct an                                                  experimentally based study of the                                               behavior of deficient columns and to                                            develop methods for calculating                                                 strength and deformability of                                                   existing columns for use by                                                     structural engineers.  The methods                                              will be useful (a) for evaluation of                                            existing structures and (b) for                                                 design of retrofitting systems that                                             are intended to protect relatively                                              brittle elements of the existing                                                structure.
