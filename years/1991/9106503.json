 "awd_abstract_narration": "Centrifuge modeling is a useful technique for                                   studying a wide variety of geotechnical                                         earthquake engineering problems.  Centrifuge                                    models of geotechnical structures can be                                        carefully instrumented and subjected to                                         extreme - that is, design level - loading                                       conditions in a repeatable and realistic manner.                                Specifically, they can be subjected to simulated                                large earthquakes.  This has the potential to                                   provide data that are extremely difficult - and                                 rarely possible - to obtain from full-scale                                     geotechnical structures subjected to naturally                                  occurring large earthquakes.                                                                                                                                    This earthquake simulation capability is already                                available at five academic institutions in the                                  U.S., but to date only small geotechnical                                       models can be subjected to simulated                                            earthquakes.  Researchers at the Rensselaer                                     Polytechnic Institute are currently designing a                                 shaker which will permit the use of                                             intermediate-sized models on the intermediate-                                  sized centrifuge at that institution.                                                                                                                           This action is to support design studies for an                                 earthquake simulator for the large geotechnical                                 centrifuge at the University of California at                                   Davis.  This simulator would have the capacity                                  to subject large models to simulated                                            earthquakes.  The unique feature of this                                        centrifuge is its bucket size (6 feet by 7 feet in                              plan), which permits experiments to be                                          conducted on large models.  The large models                                    that can be tested permit: (1) use of more                                      instrumentation while minimizing the influence                                  of instrumentation on model behavior; (2) fine                                  details can be included in the model; and (3)                                   the possibility of conducting tests at lower scale                              factors to minimize scale effects and to extend                                 the range of modeling of models (a technique                                    to verify that small-scale models are capable of                                modeling accurately the full-scale behavior).                                                                                                                   This design study is monitored by an Oversight                                  Committee composed of experts from other                                        institutions.  The Oversight Committee will                                     undertake separate design studies; which, when                                  combined with those supported by this award,                                    are expected to address effectively the                                         extremely challenging problems associated with                                  the design of a large centrifuge earthquake                                     simulation facility.",
