 "awd_abstract_narration": "Secretion, the formation of lysosomes, and receptor-mediated                    endocytosis are all mediated by intracellular packaging and                     transport of vesicles.  Intraorganelle communication also involves              the transport of vesicles.  Some of these transport processes                   utilize nucleotide-sensitive, microtubule-binding proteins to power             the vesicles movement along microtubules.  The goal of this                     research is to investigate one of these motors, cytoplasmic dynein,             which this laboratory has recently isolated from Paramecium.  The               vesicle and vacuole transport pathways in Paramecium have been                  studied extensively in this laboratory.  A logical extension of                 the previous studies is to characterize further the motor(s)                    responsible for the described movements and to investigate the                  possibility that microtubules organized into different arrays may               support movement of only certain populations of vesicles and not                others.  Experiments have been designed to (1) determine which                  direction cytoplasmic dynein moves along the microtubules in                    Paramecium, and (2) to produce monospecific polyclonal and                      monoclonal antibodies to cytoplasmic dynein to determine the                    location of this motor in the cell and to use as antagonists to                 cytoplasmic dynein activity to determine which transport functions              in cells are supported by this motor.  Finally, it is proposed to               isolate all vesicles which bind to microtubules by nucleotide-                  sensitive bridges.                                                                                                                                              The results of this research using Paramecium should provide new                information on how normal cells direct and regulate intracellular               vesicular transport.",
