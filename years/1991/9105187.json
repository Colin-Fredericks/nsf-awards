 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by three                      U.S. persons in a workshop on Image Processing to be held                       in Pune, India in July 1991.  The host institute is the                         Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics.                         The U.S. participants include two scientists and one data                       processing expert who will present lectures on image                            processing associated with observational astrophysics                           activities.  These activities have greatly increased in                         India with the construction of several telescopes including                     the 2.3 meter Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT).  The areas of                        the expertise of the three participants complement each                         other.                                                                                                                                                          Scope:  The IUCAA is the focus of astronomical and                              astrophysical research in India.  It is under the                               University Grants Commission and is to provide facilities                       to all university and other researchers in the field.  It                       is likely also to facilitate cooperation with foreign                           astronomers, including U.S. scientists.  The support                            provided by this project will enable Indian scientists to                       improve their observations and to provide better defined                        data to the world scientific community.  The project fits                       the U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program objectives.",
