 "awd_abstract_narration": "This five year project, sponsored by Grand Valley State                         University, provides support each year for 20 teacher                           interns to work in local businesses and industry in science                     and technology positions.  Based upon this experience the                       teachers are expected to design mathematics and science                         activities for their students which reflect the themes of                       (1) relevant science, mathematics and technology,                               (2) problem solving, (3) teamwork, (4) communication and                        (5) motivation and quality.  The teacher interns will also                      team up with administrators from their school system to                         explore these same five themes in regular industry training                     sessions at industry sites.  Drawing upon this experience                       the teacher/administrator teams will design appropriate                         inservice activities for other educators in their own                           school.  The teachers are expected to carryout outreach                         activities and recruit their colleagues to the project.                         These workshops will be run jointly by teacher interns and                      their industry partners and will introduce educators to the                     world of industry through the eyes of industrial science                        and math professionals and the experience of teachers who                       have participated in summer internships.                                                                                                                        NSF funds are being matched by funds from the University,                       local schools and local business and industry.  The amount                      of matching funds exceeds 124% of the NSF grant.",
