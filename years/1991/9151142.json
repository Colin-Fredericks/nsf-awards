This upgrading                      began with the establishment of lower division and upper                        division microcomputer laboratories in 1987 and 1989                            respectively.  The lower division laboratory has 20 small                       Macintosh computers and the upper division laboratory has 10                    Macintosh II stations; these laboratories were established with                 grants from Apple Computer, Inc., and the National Science                      Foundation, and University of Arkansas money.  This project                     provides a low-cost parallel computing system consisting of a                   32 node Transputer based computer with a Macintosh II front-                    end.  The Transputer machine has the capability of switching                    the interconnection schema of the nodes between any of several                  standard ones such as mesh, n-cube, and perfect-shuffle.                        Experiments are being developed to provide students with                        experiences in the implementation of parallel architectures                     tailored to favor high performance of particular algorithms                     such as bitonic merge sort and the fast Fourier transform.",
