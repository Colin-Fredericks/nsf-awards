 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Proposed program, for the first time, epitaxial growth of                thin film of high temperature Bismuth-calcium-strontium-copper-                 oxide (Bi-Ca-Sr-Cu-O) superconductor on Silicon (Si) substrate                  at low processing temperature by laser induced deposition is                    examined.  The first most important step in successful                          application of these highly promising materials in micro-                       electronics and hybrid opto-electronics, is the fabrication of                  high quality thin films on semiconductor substrate.  Thin film                  will be prepared by plasma assisted laser deposition technique                  using 265 nm UV laser at 10 Hz.   In this technique, a high flux                of UV photons is directed onto the Bi-Ca-Sr-Cu-O superconducting                target which is in close proximity to Si substrate.  This                       technique has been successfully adopted at Excel for depositing                 thin films of high temperature superconductor on various                        insulating oxide substrates.  One advantage of this technique is                that precisely controlled thin films of desired stoichiometry can               be deposited at low processing temperature without the need of                  any high temperature (900 degree C) post annealing.  This low                   temperature processing has implications relating to how thin (10-               20 nm) a film can be deposited on Si before introducing                         substrate-film interaction.  Once a high quality thin film is                   produced, the next logical step is to produce patterns in these                 films for device fabrication and also the measurements of                       critical current density.  Traditional wet processing methods                   commonly used for patterning may have a detrimental effect on                   the properties of the film.  Thus in the present work, a dry                    processing method, namely laser induced etching, will be utilized               to fabricate 10-\u001a wide line using 532 nm laser at KHz rep. rate.                Suerconductivity in the grown film will be confirmed by perfect                 conductivity at transition temperature.  Critical current density               across the micro-bridge will be measured by four probe resistive                technique.",
