 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central issue in developmental neurobiology concerns what                     factors are involved in the differentiation of ion channels in                  developing neurons.  This issue will be studied in migrating                    neurons that form the enteric nervous system in the moth,                       Manduca.  This system is uniquely suited for such studies since                 the developmental fates of these neurons are well characterized,                there are only 300 neurons in this system and these are easily                  accessible for electrophysiological recording and experimental                  manipulation in the embryo.  In addition, these neurons can be                  removed from the embryo and studied in culture.  Intracellular                  and patch clamp recordings will be performed on identified                      neurons during and after their migration in situ and in culture                 to study the expression and development of voltage dependent                    potassium, calcium dependent potassium, sodium and calcium                      currents.  These studies will lead in the future to molecular and               genetic analyses of channel gene expression.",
