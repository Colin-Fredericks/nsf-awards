 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ichthyological Collection of the Field Museum of Natural               History is one of the five most important fish collections in the               western hemisphere.  These reference collections are invaluable                 resources for systematists, ecologists, biogeographers, and a                   variety of researchers interested in fishes.  Dr. Barry Chernoff,               Curator of the collection, plans an aggressive program of                       expansion and improvement for the collections.  New storage areas               will be added and equipped with shelving systems.  The collection               will be reorganized during transfer to the new storage areas,                   making them more accessible to visiting researchers.  Data entry                of specimen information into a computerized database will also                  increase the collection's research impact.                                           Natural history collections such as this provide the                       foundation on which generations of biological research can be                   built.  Well curated collections allow direct study of the                      effects of changing climate and land use, and provide the only                  record left by extinct species.  Continued growth and improvement               of these collections serves the current research community, and                 provides critical resources for future researchers.",
