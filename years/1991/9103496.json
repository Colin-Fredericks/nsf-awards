 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of the project is to study the                       polypeptide structure of the nuclear pore complexes in Drosophila               melanogaster.  Work will focus on a myosin-like ATPase recently                 localized to Drosophila nuclear pore complexes and thought to                   participate in nucleocytoplasmic transport.  The specific goal of               this proposal is to biochemically identify the nuclear myosin-like              protein.  Work will concentrate on the purification of this protein             from Drosophila Kc tissue culture cells and/or early embryos using              affinity chromatography strategies.  Once the nuclear myosin-like               ATPase protein has been affinity purified, amino acid sequence                  information will be used to generate monospecific antibodies and                oligonucleotides to clone and sequence the gene encoding the                    Drosophila nuclear myosin-like ATPase and to confirm its nuclear                pore complex localization.                                                                                                                                      Nuclear pores are the sites at which movement of proteins, nucleic              acids, and nucleoprotein complexes take place between the cytoplasm             and the nucleus.  This is an important area of current research in              cellular biology, since communication between the nucleus and the               cytoplasm is critical to the eukaryotic cell.  Very little is known             about the transport process or the macromolecules which are                     involved.  It is generally accepted that there is an ATPase                     associated with nuclear pores.  Affinity photolabeling of a                     candidate nuclear pore ATPase led to the identification of the                  putative myosin-like pore protein, which will be studied further                with the support of this award.",
