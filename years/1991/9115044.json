 "awd_abstract_narration": "Results of preliminary strontium, oxygen and carbon isotope                studies have revealed progressive cooling, and significant climatic             and oceanographic variability during the Maastrichtian.  Episodes               of marked increases in foraminiferal del 18O values correlate with              decreases in oceanic del 13C values, documented sea level                       regressions, and increases in seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the                  early to late and latest Maastrichtian.  The coincidence of these               events, and the similarity between Maastrichtian benthic                        foraminifera del 18O values and those of middle Eocene age                      associated with ice-rafted debris, suggest that the Maastrichtian               isotopic variations could be related to glacio-eustatic phenomena.                   The research proposed will investigate and document the                    climatic and oceanographic history of the high and mid-latitude                 South Atlantic and Indian Oceans from the latest early                          Maastrichtian to the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary based on                      foraminiferal oxygen and carbon isotope measurements, and                       foraminiferal quantitative analyses.  We will attempt to determine              the effect of climatic/oceanographic changes on foraminiferal                   populations.  Stratigraphic correlation of deep-sea sections will               be enhanced by integration of biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy              and chemostratigraphy.  This data set is expected to provide a                  basis for climatic reconstruction of the Late Cretaceous including              development of new climatic models that are not based on the                    assumption of uniform, warm, and equable climatic conditions during             the Cretaceous.",
