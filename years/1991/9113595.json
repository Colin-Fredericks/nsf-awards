 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in Signal Transduction at Iowa State University.                 The faculty group is a mixture of outstanding senior and junior                 investigators who come from a variety of disciplinary                           backgrounds, but share a common interest in intra- and                          extracellular signal transduction.  The funds will provide                      stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees, will                  support research participation by undergraduate students and will               defray part of the cost of the trainees' research.  In addition,                funds will be used to purchase specialized research equipment to                be used by trainees and to bring investigators from other                       research and academic institutions to the campus for seminars and               symposia.                                                                                                                                                       Signal transduction within and between cells is fundamental to                  all types of cells and plays a crucial role in normal cell                      development and function.  Examples of signal transduction might                include the cell-cell interactions involved in development and                  function of the nervous system, and the molecular mechanisms by                 which extracellular signals effect temporary or permanent changes               in the metabolism and gene expression within individual cells.                  Typically, studies of signal transduction are directed at any of                a number of levels of cell organization, from the atomic to the                 organismal.  The faculty participating in this training group                   study cells from a variety of organisms using a variety of                      biophyisical and molecular biological techniques.  By integrating               their research programs and training activities in these various                areas, the group will promote a cross fertilization of                          intellectual and experimental approaches that should provide a                  superb experience for faculty and students alike.",
