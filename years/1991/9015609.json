 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seven projects are proposed in the area                                         of acousto-optics.  Three of these are                                          extensions of work started under the                                            previous NSF grant.  In the area of weak                                        acousto-optic interaction, three projects                                       deal with the visualization of three                                            dimensional sound fields by scattered                                           light.  Two of these are concerned with                                         high frequency, wide band Schlieren                                             imaging, of relevance to acousto-optic                                          signal processing.  The third one deals                                         with the wave analysis of a recently                                            developed convenient method of Bragg                                            diffraction imaging, of relevance to                                            diagnostics and general visualization.  The                                     four remaining projects address the, as                                         yet largely unsolved, problem of the                                            calculation of strongly interacting three-                                      dimensional light and sound fields of                                           arbitrary shape.  One of these projects                                         attacks the problem by Monte Carlo                                              computer simulation of the quantum                                              mechanical scattering process, which we                                         have shown to give good results in two                                          dimensions for known cases.  The second                                         one uses a novel \"carrierless\" beam                                             propagation algorithm, that has shown                                           considerable promise.  For the third                                            approach we will try successive Born                                            approximations using angular plane wave                                         spectra, and the last approach will be an                                       extension of the Feynman diagram                                                technique to three dimensions.  The                                             common aim of all projects is to enhance                                        the knowledge base of acousto-optics by                                         developing physically intuitive concepts,                                       formalisms and algorithms, of relevance to                                      engineering practice.  Both theoretical                                         and experimental components are present,                                        and extensive collaboration with other                                          researchers in this area, both domestic                                         and foreign, is being developed.",
