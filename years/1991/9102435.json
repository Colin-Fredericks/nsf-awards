 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project outlines a study of the rapid precipitation of                 homogeneous polymer blends from ternary solutions having a                      supercritical fluid (SCF) as the solvent.  Although polymers can                have substantial solubility in SCF's, they are insoluble in the                 same fluids in the gaseous state.  Hence, density reduction,                    which can be accomplished at the speed of sound, results in                     precipitation of the polymer dissolved in the SCF.  Because the                 time scale for precipitation can be significantly shorter than                  the time scale for phase segregation  to occur by polymer                       diffusion, expanding a single phase ternary SCF solution will                   result in a single-phase blend of solid polymers.  Thus, the                    supercritical fluid precipitation technique suggests the                        possibility of producing a homogeneous, compatible blend of                     polymers that otherwise have been found to be incompatible by                   melt blending or conventional solution blending techniques.                          The objectives of this project are: (1) to develop the                     capability of producing compatible polymer blends via a                         supercritical fluid blending process, and (2) to assess the                     stability of these prepared blends.  These objectives will be                   achieved through studies of polymer/polymer/SCF phase equilibria,               through experimental and theoretical investigations of the                      dynamics of the SCF expansion process, and through examination of               the kinetics of phase separation in the precipitated blends.  If                new, fine-state polymer mixtures can be developed using this                    novel technique, they may have high strength or other unique                    properties that will be useful in the manufacture of high-                      performance components.",
