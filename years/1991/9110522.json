 "awd_abstract_narration": "Machines During the past decade, parallel database systems                      havegained increased popularity due to their high                               performance,scalability, and availability characteristics.  With                thepredicted future database sizes and complexity of queries,it                 is essential that these systems effectively utilizehundreds or                  thousands of processors.  Several studies haverepeatedly                        demonstrated that both the performance and scalability of a                     parallel database system is contingent on the physical layout of                the data across the processors of the system.Recently, the design               of a new declustering strategy, termed Multi-Attribute GrId                     deClustering (MAGIC), was introduced.  MAGIC is superior to the                 current declustering strategies because it can partition a                      relation using two or more of its attributes.  In addition, it                  minimizes the overhead of using parallelism to allow the system                 to scale to a large number of processors.  This project focuses                 on: (1) analysis and extension of MAGIC for executing complex                   queries, and (2) incorporation of algorithms for dynamic on-line                reorganization of a relation in the presence of update queries                  and changing workload characteristics.The approach involves                     development of analytical and simulation models first, followed                 by a prototype implementation.  This research enhances the                      scalability of a parallel database machine and improve its                      performance for executing complex queries.",
