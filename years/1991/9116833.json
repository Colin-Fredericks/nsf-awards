 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arizona State University will support six women, minorities, and/or             persons with disabilities in an engineering graduate program                    designed to culminate in the awarding of a doctoral degree to each              student.  Five outstanding and complementary research areas are                 proposed in this program.  These areas are: (1) Nanoelectronics,                (2) Manufacturing Quality Improvement, (3) Telecommunications, (4)              Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems, and (5) Aerospace.  Each of                these disciplines is headed by a professor who is a recognized                  authority in his area of expertise.  Students will be recruited to              the program using a national advertising campaign based on the                  College's success with the Industrial Fellows Program.  Candidates              will be invited to campus to meet the faculty, students, and to                 become acquainted with the research facilities available at the                 graduate level.  Final selection will be made by the departmental               graduate committee, in conjunction with the PI's.  Immediately upon             selection the student will be assigned a mentor to assist in the                preliminary phase of his/her program.  ASU's effort to recruit                  underrepresented students is vigorously supported by the state                  legislature and the Board of Regents who have provided special                  funds for this purpose.",
