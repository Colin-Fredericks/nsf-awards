 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine invertebrate species often have life cycles involving                    planktonic larvae which must settle on benthic substrates before                they metamorphose into the adult form.  Such species include edible             shellfish likde mussels, oysters and abalone, as well as fouling                organisms such as barnacles, hydroids and bryazoans.  The process               of settlement and metamorphosis is not random.  Larvae of many, if              not most of the species investigated respond to specific chemicals              associated with their adult environment.  Relatively little is                  known about these \"natural\" cues, and only a few have been either               partially or completely identified.                                                                                                                             This study will focus on identifying and documenting the origin of              the natural chemical cues of settlemlent and metamorphosis of                   planulae larvae of the \"upside down\" jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana.             Preliminary evidence shows that the larvae of this species settle               preferentially on old, degrading mangrove leaves.  Larvae appear                to respond to soluble chemicals released from the leaf, either                  diffusing directly from the leaf or the result of bacterial action              during decomposition.  The role of bacteria in producing specific               cues for the settlement of larvae will be determined.  The fact                 that another genetic entity (e.g. bacteria can play an integral                 role in the life cycle a different species is more common in nature             than originally thought.                                                                                                                                        Larvae of jellyfish are relatively simple animals, compared with                more complicated \"higher\" invertebrates such as shellfish.                      Therefore the cellular, molecular and physiological mechanisms in               settlement and metamorphosis may be easier to elucidate and provide             a \"model\" for other invertebrate species.//",
