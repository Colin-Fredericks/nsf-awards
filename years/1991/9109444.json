 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will initiate                   preliminary work to determine the feasibility of extending one-                 dimensional techniques to investigate the rates of convergence of               two-dimensional Fourier series and more general eigenfunction                   expansions of Sturm-Liouville type.  In particular, she will                    consider rates of convergence and the asymptotic behavior of                    partial sums of functions of bounded variation and functions whose              derivatives have bounded variation.                                                  Problems involving eigenfunction expansions arise in a host of             areas of applied mathematics and engineering.  There are two basic              questions that need to be answered.  The first involves the rate of             convergence of the expansion and the second involves the asymptotic             behavior of the partial sums as the number of terms increases to                infinity.  The principal investigator plans on answering these                  questions for series expansions in two dimensions by extending                  techniques that have worked for series in one dimension.",
