 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on communication and has two parts.  Part one                  concerns costly signaling by multiple parties.  With few                        exceptions, signaling has been modeled as a game with one informed              sender.  This is inappropriate for situations with multiple                     informed parties.  For example, industry insiders tend to have                  better information about their industry or each other's products                than do outsiders, and many of their actions, such as pricing,                  investment, or advertising choices, are separably observed by the               outsiders.  Such senders \"compete\" in the signaling domain to                   influence the beliefs of receivers.  This research will develop                 models of signaling competition in correlated private information               settings.  A central focus will be on the conditions under which                signaling competition reduces asymmetric information losses.                                                                                                    Part two concerns communication which is not costly, \"cheap talk.\"              Simple talking plays a large role in actual economic activity, but              it plays no role in most economic models.  The proposed research                will develop theoretical models of face-to-face communication                   without mediators, emphasizing the role of multiple rounds of                   message exchange.  Cheap talk refinement criteria for games with                multiple privately informed parties and multiple rounds of                      communication will also be considered.                                                                                                                          These analyses are important because they will help advance our                 understanding in two issues in communication, namely, interacting               signals sent by agents, and face-to-face and costless communication             conveyed by people.",
