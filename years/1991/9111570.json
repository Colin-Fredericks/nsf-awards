 "awd_abstract_narration": "The motivation for this proposal is derived from the                            problem of robust control in the presence of structured                         real uncertain parameters.  More specifically, it deals                         exclusively with linear systems described by a transfer                         function or state space model which includes uncertain                          parameters entering into various plant coefficients.                            The takeoff point for research is the body of literature                        motivated by Kharitonov's Theorem.  Given the fact                              that this body of literature deals almost exclusively with                      robust stability analysis, the first focal point of the                         research is synthesis of robust stabilizing controllers.                        A spark for this line of work is provided by some                               recent extreme point results (involving the PI) on                              robust stabilization of an interval plant (ratio of                             interval polynomials) with a first order controller.                            Additional motivation is also provided by the so-called                         value set approach.  Given the widespread use of value                          sets in an analysis context, the open question is: To                           what extent are value sets useful in a synthesis context?                       The second focal point of this proposal is robust                               performance.  That is, the objective is to deal with                            robust performance specifications over and above                                stability.  Analogous to the investigation of robust                            stabilization, the intention is to begin the work by                            looking at robust performance problems with low order                           controllers and then to follow up with the higher order                         case.  In this framework, a number of important                                 research problems are proposed.  The third and final                            focal point is described by the words generating                                mechanism.  That is, to enlarge the class of                                    uncertainties which can be accommodated, it is                                  proposed to impose more structure on the \"uncertain\"                            polynomials and rational functions which arise in the                           analysis.",
