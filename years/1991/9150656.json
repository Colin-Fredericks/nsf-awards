 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to help support The BioQUEST Curriculum               Development Project.  The program is an extension of an inaugural               curriculum development effort of a consortium of biologists who                 designed instructional materials based on a three P's (Problem-                 posing, Problem-solving, and Persuasion of peers) approach to                   learning.  This first demonstration project has resulted in a                   national network of biologists dedicated to the improvement of                  introductory and non-majors level undergraduate biology education               by stressing the use of open-ended problems.  Now the intent of                 the BioQUEST project is to enlarge this network by gathering an                 additional consortium of biologists who will be part of a major                 instructional materials development project aimed at integrating                a research approach to learning.  These materials will include                  the development of additional software simulations and tools, the               design of instructional materials built around existing software,               the development of materials that reflect the 3P's approach that                are not computer dependent, and the development of materials and                approaches that can be used in large lectures to engage students                in problem-posing, problem solving, or persuasion.  Funds from                  this award will be used to develop materials in a broader array                 of topics than the initial demonstration project which focused on               biochemistry, ecology, evolution, genetics, and physiology.  The                materials developed in these workshops will be tested, refined,                 discussed in a follow-up mini-workshop, and then disseminated as                widely as possible.  Besides coordinating the efforts of these                  sixty teacher/developers, BioQUEST staff will continue to develop               their own investigative lab and field exercises, computer                       simulations, and other teaching materials; will edit and                        disseminate materials; coordinate campus testing and evaluation                 of materials; and present national symposia on the development                  project.",
