 "awd_abstract_narration": "The X chromosome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has three               specialized properties: it controls sex determination via the X/A               ratio; X-linked genes are subject to dosage compensation; and it is             under independent meiotic control.  My previous work has focused on             the relationship of sex determination to dosage compensation.  This             proposal describes a molecular study of dpy-26, an autosomal gene               that affects all three of these properties, to understand how the               properties are related.  Two other autosomal genes that affect sex              determination and dosage compensation, but not meiosis, will be                 studied for comparison to dpy-26.  In addition, this proposal                   outlines a genetic and molecular analysis of two genes that                     specifically affect disjunction and recombination of the X                      chromosome, with no effect on the autosomes.  We will use these                 genes to investigate the relationship among exchange, disjunction,              and conversion on the X chromosome.  We will also identify new                  mutations that specifically reduce or eliminate recombination on                the X chromosome.                                                                                                                                               In conjunction with the analysis of dpy-26, analysis of these genes             will likely contribute to the understanding of both the general                 mechanisms of meiosis and the chromosome-specific mechanisms of                 meiosis.***//",
