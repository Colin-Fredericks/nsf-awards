 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal communities at the recently discovered deep Sea                          hydrothermal vents (depth >2000 m) exhibit biomass densities                    which are probably as high as any ecosystem on earth.  As a                     matter reaches the sea floor at such depths (Suess, 1980).                      Instead, local production of organic carbon by chemoautotrophic                 bacteria is believed to form much or all of the nutritional                     base at these vents.  At the vents some of these bacteria are                   free-living either suspended in hydrothermal plumes or attached                 to surfaces (Jannasch and Mottl, 1985; Jannasch, 1989).  These                  offer food sources for filter feeding and surface grazing vent                  animals.  In this permanently dark environment, however, the                    major portion of life-supporting interactions between bacteria                  and animals occurs in endosymbiotic associations (reviewed by                   Childress et al., 1987).  In most examples studied to date the                  symbiont is some type of chemoautotrophic sulfur bacterium, but                 methane oxidizing symbionts are also known (Cavanaugh et al.,                   1987; Childress et al., 1986).  Chemoautotrophic sulfur                         bacteria generate energy (ATP or a proton motive force) by the                  oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (sulfide, elemental                       sulfur, thiosulfate, etc.) and usually fix CO2 via the Calvin-                  Benson cycle also employed by green plants and algae,  There                    are two general ways a symbiont might provide nutrients to its                  host.  The symbiont might remain intact but overproduce certain                 organics which leak out of the symbiont or be deposited                         extracellularly.  Alternatively, the host might degrade a                       fraction of the bacteria using lytic enzymes, possibly                          localized in vacuoles.  There is little evidence pointing to                    the operation of either mechanism.",
