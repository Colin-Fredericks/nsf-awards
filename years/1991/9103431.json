 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many practical problems require for their solution the sampling of a            random object from a combinatorial class or, worse, an exhaustive               search through all objects in the class.  In order for such a search            to be possible, even for problems of moderate size, combinatorial               generation methods must be extremely efficient.                                      As an example, the Gray code approach to combinatorial generation          is to generate the objects as a list in which successive elements               differ only in a small way, as in the binary reflected Gray code.               Each combinatorial Gray code problem has an alternate formulation as a          Hamilton path or cycle problem in an associated graph, which may be             vertex transitive or even a Cayley graph.                                            Asymptotic improvement in the efficiency of combinatorial                  generation requires not only good data structures and algorithm design          techniques, but, more often, some new insight into the structure of             the combinatorial class involved.  These structure questions put us             into the realm of well-known open problems on Hamilton cycles, graph            isomorphism, Cayley graphs, and symmetric chain decompositions in               lattices.  Progress on the enumeration problems is made by studying             the structure problems hand in hand.                                                 The research proposed herein is to continue work on combinatorial          generation and Gray codes and also to address directly some of the              outstanding problems in related areas.  These include the Hamilton              cycle problem on vertex transitive graphs and Cayley graphs, new                problems on de Bruijn - like sequences, and the existence of symmetric          chain decompositions and complete matchings in certain partially                ordered sets involving permutations and integer partitions.",
