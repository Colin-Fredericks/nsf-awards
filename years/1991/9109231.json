 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the static analysis of concurrent                 software systems.  The purpose of this analysis is to determine                 whether a given program or program specification satisfies certain              correctness requirements, such as freedom of deadlock or absence of             starvation.  The goal of this research project is to define new                 techniques and automated tools for the analysis of concurrent                   programs.  The new techniques will be aimed at extending and                    integrating existing analysis methods.  To date a number of approaches          to the analysis of concurrent programs have been proposed.  Some                approaches have been implemented and the resulting analysis tools have          been tested on some well-known examples of concurrent programs.  At             present, however, little is known about the types and sizes of                  programs to which each approach can be usefully applied, and the kinds          of questions about the programs that the approach can effectively               answer.  Some approaches which use linear algebra or temporal logic             based techniques to perform portions of the analysis are especially             promising.  These approaches will be investigated in an effort to               characterize their relative strengths and weaknesses.                           The evaluation of the existing approaches will guide the definition of          new analysis techniques.  Preliminary investigations in this area have          identified various possibilities for extending and integrating                  existing approaches.  The new analysis techniques must be amenable to           the implementation of automated analysis tools.  Practical                      experimentations and the evaluation of performance results will play a          crucial role when assessing the relative strengths of existing and              proposed approaches.",
