The                  present pier, built in the early 1960's has deteriorated to the                 point that it is unsafe for vehicles that must use it to service                the ship.  The cost will be shared with Duke University.  The                   University which has already funded an engineering study, will be               responsible for the south pier and trestle which services small                 boats, and NSF funds will be used for a new concrete north pier                 and trestle plus electrical service improvements.  The new pier                 will significantly reduce maintenance costs and should see many                 years of service.",
