 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new patented method to reduce the oscillatory behavior of                electro-mechanical systems, called Command Input Pulse Shaping, was             successfully demonstrated in Phase I of this SBIR effort.  When                 implemented on essentially single-mode systems, dramatic                        improvements in dynamic behavior were observed, with settling times             being reduced by factors ranging from 3 to 5.  The current work is              to now implement this technique to more complex multi-mode systems              and to refine and fine tune the procedure to achieve better and                 quicker results.                                                                     The economic and technological impact of this work is                      potentially tremendous.  Almost all electro-mechanical machinery,               in manufacturing and other industries, are constrained in their                 ability to perform by their dynamic characteristics that leads to               vibratory motion.  A practical technique that can counter this,                 would have far reaching consequences in terms of improving                      performance and allowing the equipment to perform at increased                  rates.  The economic impact of this possibility could be                        significant.",
