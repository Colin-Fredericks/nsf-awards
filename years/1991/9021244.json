 "awd_abstract_narration": "Skilled movements are thought to be produced by adding together                 in series a number of simpler movements. In the case of skilled                 movements of the hands and fingers, simultaneous movements of                   both hands are often involved. This project to be conducted by                  Dr.John Soechting will use the movements of the hands and fingers               during typing as a model for the way in which complex, bimanual                 movements can be derived by putting together a sequence of                      simpler movements. In typing, these simpler movements are the                   individual keystrokes and the movment sequence is the series of                 keystrokes that generate a word or a phrase. The motions of the                 hands and of the fingers will initially be described for single                 letters typed in isolation. Then the process of how such                        individual movements are put together in series will be studied                 by asking subjects to type words in which only two letters are                  typed by one hand and all other letters are typed with the other                hand. Finally, by changing the location of the keys on the                      keyboard and forcing typists to relearn the keyboard layout, the                processes by which movement sequences are learned will be                       studied. This research will contribute to understanding how                     individual motor acts are integrated to form coordinated series                 of movements.",
