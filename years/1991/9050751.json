It is                   being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement               (ILI) Program, which has the goal of supporting projects to                     develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory               courses in science, mathematics, or engineering.  The                           Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program provides                     matching support for the instrumentation necessary to implement                 undergraduate instructional improvements at U.S. colleges and                   universities.                                                                        In particular, the main objective of this project is to                    enable instructors to show more realistic examples and                          demonstrate the use of the programs and languages they expect                   their students to use.  The part of the curriculum targeted for                 improvement in this project is a group of courses with an                       applications emphasis designed for science and engineering                      majors.  The courses to be affected include differential                        equations, Fourier analysis, linear algebra, numerical analysis,                linear programming, combinatorics, and number theory.",
