 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynein is a protein which \"powers\" the translocation of                      molecules along microtubules.  Dynein is responsible for ciliary                and flagellar beating, organelle transport (including axonal                    transport), and aspects of mitotic anaphase motion.  Distinct                   isoforms of dynein are thought to perform each of these functions.              It is hypothesized that dynein is the composite of motor domains                that are common to all dyneins and tether domains that are unique               to each isoform and that define the location of the isoform and                 link the dynein to the molecule that is translocated along the                  microtubule.                                                                                                                                                    The long term objective of this project is to determine the                     structures of dynein isoforms that are expressed in the developing              sea urchin embryo, an excellent system for the study of dynein                  isoforms.  The complete sequence of sea urchin axonemal dynein beta             heavy chain has recently been determined.  The goals of the current             three year project are to produce a library of monoclonal                       antibodies to selected epitopes along the length of the beta chain,             to use the antibodies to determine what epitopes are exposed on the             surface of the native dynein molecule, and to begin the exploration             of isoform-specific epitopes.                                                                                                                                   This project will provide new information that is critical for the              elucidation of the molecular mechanism of dynein activity, and will             lead to an eventual understanding of the structural basis for                   dynein isoform functional diversity.",
