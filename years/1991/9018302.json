 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although crinoid ossicles (skeletal plates) are common                     components of many ancient limestones and shales, they have                     received relatively little attention from the standpoint of                     taphonomy.  With the recent documentation of crinoid ossicles in                Recent sea floor sediment, the opportunity now exists to pursue                 actualistic studies of the taphonomy of individual plates.                           The main emphasis of the study lies in the area of plate                   degradation: objectives are to determine relative resistance to                 abrasion and dissolution, to examine the distribution of these                  taphonomic processes and others in the study area, and to set some              constraints on the rates of these processes.  With respect to                   transport, objectives are to determine the sites of accumulation                of transported ossicles, and to see if ossicles travel as bedload.              The primary objectives with regard to diagenesis are to determine               if ossicles are \"prefossilized\" by sediment infilling or early                  diagenesis and to determine if biostratinomic signatures are still              recognizable in ossicles recovered from Pleistocene reef rocks.                      Sediment samples taken from the upper 2-3 cm of the sediment               and from 1-2 meter cores will be used to map the distribution of                plates and their degree and type of alteration.  Laboratory                     experiments of abrasion and dissolution and implants on the sea                 floor will aid in defining processes and constraining rates of                  degradation.                                                                         Because the vast majority of fossil crinoid material consists              of disarticulated skeletons, this approach will help to make a                  large volume of fossil material more useful to other scientists,                assisting geologists from sedimentologists to crinoid specialists.",
