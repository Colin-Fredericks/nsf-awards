 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is designed to investigate the range                       of approaches used by multinational organizations to                            handle cultural diversity and their relationship to                             employee productivity, job satisfaction, and intergroup                         attitudes. Foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies, U.S.                         subsidiaries of Japanese companies, and similarly sized                         domestic units of U.S. corporations will be assessed in terms                   of their approaches to cultural diversity at the organizational                 level.  Using methods derived from organizational diagnosis and                 organizational culture perspectives, as well as newly developed                 questionnaires for key organization members, data will be                       gathered about programs, procedures and policies related to                     organizational awareness of multicultural issues and                            organizational handling of cultural differences.  To                            investigate the implications of different organizational                        policies and practices regarding cultural diversity on                          individual employees, a subset of organizations representing                    the range of approaches will be studied in greater depth.  At                   these sites, additional surveys of approaches will be studied                   in greater depth.  At these sites, additional surveys of                        employees at different levels will assess variables such as job                 satisfaction, work related behavior, and individual                             perspectives on cultural diversity.  Comparisons of                             these variables among organizations will permit making                          inferences about the relationships between organizational and                   individual level variables.",
