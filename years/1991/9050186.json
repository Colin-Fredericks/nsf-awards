The technical approach is to create interactive media, both                     a computer program and text based materials, to stimulate                       and inform the students concerning the activities of                            professional engineers, academic and social life in college,                    course requirements for both High School and College, etc.                      The combined media will use an \"adventure\" format with many                     possible scenarios dependent upon the student's selection,                      plus humor, and special effects (e.g. computer sound and                        animation) to sustain interest.  Examples will relate the                       secondary school course content with the engineer's                             practices.                                                                                                                                                      The program will be conducted in conjunction with the                           California State University, Long Beach MESA (minority                          outreach) and MEP (Minority Engineering Programs), and in                       conjunction with Compton Middle schools (grades 6-8).  A                        computer simulation with text accompaniments and teacher's                      guides will be completed and field tested in the junior high                    schools.  The success of this model will lead to a range of                     materials for economical, nationwide dissemination and                          application on many educational levels for minorities,                          women, disabled, and other special and general populations.",
