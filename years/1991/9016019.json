 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor David Mulcahy of the                          University of Massachusetts in a research collaboration with                    Professor Mauro Cresti of the University of Siena, Italy.                       The investigators intend to study microbial-like competition                    among pollen grains.  Preliminary data indicate that while                      microspores (pollen grains-to-be) are still united in                           tetrads, they are competing with each other for resources.                      The major evidence for such intratetrad competition is that                     the deletion of one to three members within the tetrad is                       characterized by increases in the size of the viable members.                   The extent to which surviving members are able to absorb the                    resources of aborted members, the degree to which viable                        members compete among themselves, and the extent to which                       ultrastructural changes may express this competition are some                   of the topics that will be addressed by this research.                                                                                                          In the angiosperms (and gymnosperms) pollen represents a                        microbial-like system of extremely large population and                         genotypes.  Although pollen comprises a small portion of the                    angiosperm life cycle, it expresses, and thus exposes to                        selection, approximately 60% of all spirophytically expressed                   genes.  This system is particularly effective in the                            angiosperms and may represent a significant contributor to                      the adaptive superiority of that group in the world flora.                      By combining the genetic approach of the U.S. researcher with                   the focus on pollen microstructure of the Italian investigator,                 this study will not only examine a newly appreciated aspect                     of microspore competition, it may also reveal information                       which could be useful in using pollen selection to develop                      plants resistant to agronomically and ecologically important                    stresses.",
