 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Student-Oriented project is improving introductory science                  coerces by 1)  developing new microcomputer-based laboratory                    (MBL) tools useful in a number of disciplines, 2)  developing,                  supporting, disseminating, and evaluating interactive                           introductory physics materials of the type developed in the                     Tools for Scientific Thinking project at Tufts University and                   in the Workshop Physics program at Dickinson College.  The work                 is being extended to the learning environments found at large                   universities.  The flexibility of these materials allows                        colleges and universities to incrementally introduce changes in                 the way they teach.  The project is extensively testing both                    individual learning modules and total curricula by working with                 physicists from Dickinson College, Tufts University, University                 of Oregon, Boise State University in Idaho, Muskingum College,                  Ohio State, Rutgers University, the University of Washington,                   and others.  Several criteria which will be considered in the                   evaluation of the materials include student attitudes toward                    science, level of scientific literacy, and conceptual learning                  gains.  Materials are being produced that work well with                        underprepared and science-anxious students and with non-science                 as well as science majors.",
