 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gulf has long been recognized as an important biologically                  productive ecosystem which supports a diversity of coastal and                  oceanic habitats.  These include mangroves, seagrass beds, reef                 flats, reefs and well as pelagic and benthic oceanic habitats.                  Commercial fisheries and shellfish industries provide income to                 regional fisherman and The Gulf provides a critical habitat to                  some endangered species including dugongs and birds.  The massive               oil spills and the depositions of oil burn products resulting                   from the 1991 war activities have potential for long term impact                on both the oceanic and coastal biology.  These events are                      superimposed on coastal habitat destruction due to military                     activities such as mines, bombs, vehicular movement and related                 mechanical disturbances.  All of this additional stress must be                 assessed in the framework of the recent history of oil                          exploration and production activities and past wars.   Many                     national and international groups have undertaken preliminary                   impact assessment work in the Northern Gulf.  These include the                 USCG, US EPA, NOAA consultants sent by several UN agencies and                  regional Gulf state authorities.  These efforts have been                       directed at initial animal rescue activities, clean up and                      assessment in coastal habitats.  The UN agencies, in                            collaboration with ROPME, have intentions of developing and                     implementing a plan for the long term impact assessment of recent               war related pollution and habitat destruction events on the                     marine ecology or The Gulf.  To do this the UN requires input by                appropriate expert.  This effort will be conducted under the                    SGER Program to undertake this long range Plan Development                      regarding the marine chemical component.",
