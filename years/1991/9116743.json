 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program to prepare minority graduate students for a career in                 engineering education has been designed by the Faculty of the                   Watson School, SUNY-Binghamton, in conjunction with the engineering             Faculty of Morgan State University, a historically black university             in Baltimore.  The program, called The Partnership, features early              identification of academically talented engineering students at                 Morgan State, and provides academic advising and support to smooth              the transition to graduate school at SUNY-Binghamton, financial                 support through the NSF Graduate Engineering Education Fellowship               for the first three years of graduate study, and specific training              and encouragement for an academic career.  The Watson School and                Morgan State are uniquely suited to develop a successful                        collaborative program.  Both are relatively small, young programs               with a strong commitment to minority engineering education, links               with industry and active support for minority education from the                state governments.  Both have faculty members who are active in                 engineering education societies.  They have already established a               faculty seminar exchange.",
