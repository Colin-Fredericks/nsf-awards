Data will                be obtained on atmospheric extinction at eight wavelengths                      including a water vapor absorption band.  These data will permit                the correction of airglow photometric data for absorption in the                earth's troposphere.  In addition, the background sky brightness                will be monitored at each wavelength.  Two wavelengths will be                  set at emission lines due to mercury and sodium which are emitted               strongly by outside lights at night.  Clouds illuminated by such                lighting produces a strong source of sky pollution which reduces                the quality of night sky observations.  Results from this                       instrument will be invaluable to other observers who must operate               their instrument in an unmanned automatic mode.  With data                      corrected for extinction better agreement between observations                  and model predictions should result; likewise agreement between                 various observers' results should improve.  Commercial devices                  will be used as far as possible to reduce development time.  The                resulting data set will be provided to campaign observers and                   will be deposited in the CEDAR data bank.",
