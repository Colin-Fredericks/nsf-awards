 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the relationship between a male and a                     female in a monogamous pair of fish, the Midas cichlid of                       Nicaragua.  As is typical of monogamous species, males and                      females look alike and have the same behavior patterns.  Pair                   formation is accompanied by high levels of threat display as each               sex probes to determine that the other has the wherewithal to                   obtain and protect a breeding territory, and to defend the eggs                 and young against predators.  When arbitrarily selected, only                   about 50% of pairs put together successfully mate; aggression                   gets out of control in the others.  Some fish lose their dark                   pigments and become strikingly gold in color.  The gold-colored                 fish inhibit aggression in their opponents; thus nature has                     provided a unique experimental tool for exploring pair                          relationships.                                                                                                                                                  The experiments are of two types.  In the first, Dr. Barlow will                test three alternative hypotheses in aquaria.  Each makes                       different predictions about the success of pairing depending on                 the aggressiveness of the individuals.  In the second experiment,               Dr. Barlow will explore the relationship between color,                         aggressiveness, and sex, using a large pool situation.  In the                  field, the fish mate predominantly with those of the same color,                but experiments have proved that they have no preferences by                    color that would predict such an outcome.  The effect of gold                   color on aggression probably produces assortative mating in the                 field; if so, this can tell us something important about mate                   compatibility.  Dr. Barlow will also make a field trip to                       Nicaragua to test conclusions and predictions.                                                                                                                  This project departs from the prevailing vogue.  Current theory                 on mating has led to an emphasis on polygynous species, in which                the sexes look strikingly different from one another, mate                      quickly, then separate.  Mates in monogamous species remain                     together and have a greater need to adjust aggressiveness.  The                 Midas cichlid offers the possibility of being a model species for               understanding intersexual aggression in monogamous species in                   general.  Note that spousal abuse is exceedingly common in                      humans; in the USA, a spouse is abused on average every 15                      seconds.  Finally, the Midas cichlid is the most important food                 fish in Nicaragua; information about its reproductive behavior is               useful in managing and culturing this species.",
