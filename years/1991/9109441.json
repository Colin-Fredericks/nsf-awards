 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gibbons are the one nonhuman primate closely related to humans                  that exists with an apparent monogamous mating relationship and a               family-unit form of social organization.  Moreover, these animals               represent an endangered species that have not been adequately                   studied.  Using a semi-natural environment, Dr. Nadler will carry               out a series of studies on gibbon reproductive endocrinology,                   stress and behavior.  The research program integrates                           evolutionary, functional and mechanistic issues and approaches at               several levels including physiology, behavior and taxonomy.                     This work is of great importance in discerning the possible                     origins of human behavior.  The ideas fostered by this research                 may lead to a better understanding of the nature of monogamy in                 primates and with respect to possible parallels to human mating                 systems.  Moreover, information about reproductive physiology on                gibbons is critical for the conservation and maintenance of this                endangered species.  Finally, given their close biological                      relationship, information gained from this work is of potential                 value in elucidating the interactions between reproductive                      hormones and behavior in humans.",
