 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes in energy supply require societal adjustments.  It is              important to understand the nature of those adjustments and what                potential contribution changes in household energy-use behavior can make        in the face of an impending energy shortfall.  This doctoral                    dissertation project will study two Swedish towns that are dependent            upon different energy sources as they comply with the result of a               national referendum issued by the Swedish government to phase out the           country's nuclear reactors.  Historical and theoretical analysis and            empirical research involving focus groups, telephone questionnaires, and        a mass media analysis will be used to illuminate the positions of those         groups that were involved in the nuclear referendum debate and to assess        the potential for household energy-conservation programs.                                                                                                            This project will provide information valuable both to the                 scientific community and to policy makers about how grassroots behavior         can lead to an acceptance of difficult economic tradeoffs in the                interest of environmental management.  This project also will provide an        excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to              develop independent research skills.",
