 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of model building is of fundamental                                 importance to science and engineering.  Although                                modeling, especially linear modeling, has been                                  extensively investigated and applied, most of the                               existing frameworks are based on stochastic                                     approximation of the modeling error, an assumption                              that cannot be justified on physical ground in many                             applications.  A general, deterministic, modeling                               framework for linear systems has recently been put                              forward by Willems.  Parallel to this, Antoulas                                 developed a detailed and explicit recursive realization                         theory, i.e. a theory of recursiveness of exact modeling                        based on impulse response time series.  Preliminary                             results have shown that the above two research projects                         overlap and complement each other in significant ways.                          This motivates investigations into the recursiveness                            structure of exact and approximate modeling.  These                             investigations, and in particular the recursiveness                             results, complemented with the necessary software in                            the form of a hard disc, will be used at a later stage to                       develop a new framework for deterministic adaptive                              control.                                                                                                                                                        We propose to develop a whole class of alternative                              (deterministic) ways of approaching linear recursive                            modeling.  It has the potential of significant impact in                        areas where model building is needed for predictive                             purposes, as well as in areas where modeling is needed                          for control applications, especially so, for the control of                     plants in dynamically changing environments.",
