 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will receive support                   for shipboard technician activities associated with the three                   major research vessels that are operated by the Institution.                    A significant portion of the ships' operating schedules in                      recent years and again in 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored                   research projects.  The Shipboard Technician Program has two                    components: an at-sea component and an ashore component.                                                                                                        The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                         personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;                             maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific                              instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck                            operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming                     and off-going scientific parties.  On shore activities                          include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared                      use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in                    preparing for field work on the vessel.  Shipboard                              technicians funded by this award have broad responsibilities                    for providing the coordination and assistance needed for the                    successful completion of research projects at sea.  The level                   of activity and amount of support are closely related to the                    size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                    and capability.",
