 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research program is to develop                    new overall computational schemes which employ spectral                         methods for the accurate and efficient solution of fluid flows                  with radiative transfer.  This will significantly extend the                    class of radiation problems that may be studied numerically.                    For example, oscillating or weakly turbulent flows could be                     fully resolved in a simulation without approximation, i.e.                      numerical solutions to the exact forms of the governing                         equations could be obtained.  Specifically, the governing                       equations (Navier-Stokes, energy conservation, and radiative                    transfer equations) will be discretized and solved by                           employing Fourier series and Chebyshev polynomials as basis                     expansion functions with efficient pseudospectral collocation                   and tau algorithms.  To develop and validate these schemes,                     and to evaluate their performance and accuracy, the new models                  will be applied to the problem of combined radiation and                        natural convection in flows with participating media between                    concentric, horizontal cylinders.  Experiments will also be                     performed to provide quantitative information for this                          purpose.  A holographic interferometer will be used to provide                  measurements of the temperature field, and Laser Doppler                        Velocimetry (LDV) will be used for measurements of the                          fluctuating velocity field.  The concentric cylinder geometry                   is chosen due to its relatively simple configuration and the                    well-documented existence of oscillating flows and transition                   to turbulence in the natural convection case.  Successful                       completion of the proposed research program will dramatically                   improve our ability to perform engineering radiation heat                       transfer analyses.",
