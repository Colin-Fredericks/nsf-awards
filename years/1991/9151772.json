 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science faculty at New Mexico Highlands University                 has developed degree programs in Computer Science and Computer                  Information Systems that meet the needs of largely, under-                      represented students.  These students are highly motivated but                  have been poor foudations in problem solving, internal model                    development, and abstraction skills - all important in                          understanding the concepts of Computer Science.  This project                   augments the present curriculum in Computer Science and                         Computer Information Systems by adding computer laboratories to                 a number of the courses.  For each laboratory, exercises and                    computational experiments are being developed to help the                       students realize the abstractions they find so difficult.  The                  goal is to allow more students to graduate with strong computer                 science backgrounds and a sense of confidence.",
