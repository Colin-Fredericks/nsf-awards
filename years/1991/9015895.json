 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in mathematical                  physics  between Dr. Peter Hislop, University of Kentucky and                   Dr. Jean-Michel Combes, University of Toulon and Var, La                        Garde, France.  The objective of the proposed research is to                    investigate quantum mechanics of ordered and disordered media.                                                                                                  The quantum behavior of a charged particle moving in a                          periodic array of atoms is determined by the bands of allowed                   energy.  Any particle with energy in these bands will                           propagate to infinity in the crystal.  Physically, this is an                   idealized situation which corresponds to matter with infinite                   conductivity.  These transport properties of matter, for                        example the conductivity, change dramatically when the                          material is immeresed in electric and magnetic fields or when                   the perfect order of the crystal is broken by impurities.                       Changes of this type may cause states of the system to be                       well-localized in energy and space.  A key ingredient in the                    formation of these localized states is quantum tunneling                        through potential barriers.  A particle propagating with                        energy E will encounter regions of space where the potential                    is larger than E.  Classically, the particle is forbidden to                    traverse these regions, but quantum mechnically, the wave                       function will penetrate them.  However, the net effect of many                  barriers may be to well-localize the particle.  In this                         project, the investigators will concentrate on the spectral                     structure of these systems with an emphasis on the role                         played by quantum tunnelling.  They will study the resonance                    states and the scattering theory of crystals in electric                        fields.  They will also study models of disordered media in                     which diffusive behavior is suppressed by potential barriers.                   The project will benefit from the significant and complementary                 expertise of the two investigators in the areas of quantum                      resonances and scattering theory.",
