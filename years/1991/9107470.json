 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sunlight significantly affects the heat or cold stress                     experienced by animals in nature.  Historically, biologists                     expected that heat gain from solar radiation was largely                        determined by an animal's surface coloration (e.g., darker                      surfaces acquire greater heat loads).  Dr. Walsberg has                         demonstrated that mammals and birds can alter heat gain                         independently of animal coloration.  The current project extends                these previous analyses by quantifying the significance of such                 adjustments for heat balance and energy expenditure of animals in               their natural habitats.  Three species will be studied:  (1)                    Golden-mantled Ground Squirrels in which different populations                  differ greatly in coloration but manage to maintain constant                    solar heat loads, (2) a contrasting case in which populations of                House Finches remain similar in coloration across wide geographic               distances yet adaptively alter solar heat gain, and (3) the Rock                Squirrel which maintains the same appearance over the annual                    cycle yet substantially increases solar heat gain during cold                   winter months.                                                                       This research should improve understanding of the diverse                  functions performed by the insulating coats of animals.  This                   work will contribute substantially to understanding of the                      thermal stresses imposed upon birds and mammals in nature as well               as the selection pressures affecting solar heat gain, thermal                   insulation, and visual communication.                                                These studies have potential practical implications because                thermal and energetic stresses are important problems in                        livestock production and because human clothing essentially is an               artificial substitute for the fur or feather coats of mammals and               birds.  Understanding the mechanisms produced by natural                        selection in wild animals and which adaptively adjust solar heat                gain may provide useful insights into properties that would be                  advantageous from an applied perspective.",
