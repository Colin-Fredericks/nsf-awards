 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science and Mathematics department of Holmes Community                      College is improving its astronomy laboratory curriculum by                     acquiring instrumentation which will allow students to collect                  scientifically valuable data.  The department is using a 14-                    inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, photometer, CCD imaging                      camera, video camera and conventional photography equipment.                    In addition, a planetarium and computers are being used for                     preparation for outdoor observations.  The photometer is used                   to determine the lightcurves of variable stars.  The                            astrometric capabilities of the CCD imaging camera allow                        students to determine the angular separation between objects.                   Students can also use the CCD imaging camera to plot the                        movement of objects (such as comets and asteroids) relative to                  the stars.  The CCD camera also has photometric capability and                  allows students to measure changes in the brightness and                        structure of comets.  The video camera is used to record and                    time occultations.  The video camera also makes the telescope                   more accessible to visually and physically handicapped                          students.  The college is housing the instruments in an                         existing domed observatory.The instruments allow students to                    participate in the entire scientific process, from the                          development of an observing program to the reduction and                        analysis of data.  The department plans its observing programs                  in association with several amateur astronomical societies to                   which students may submit data and publications.",
