 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator analyzes large systems of coupled                         oscillators that arise in various branches of biology and                       condensed-matter physics.  A common theme is the spontaneous                    emergence of synchronization due to cooperative interactions                    among the oscillators.  The systems of ordinary differential                    equations that constitute the models will be investigated                       analytically and numerically.  Techniques to be used include                    methods of dynamical systems, bifurcation theory, statistical                   mechanics, and numerical simulation.  Real-time computer                        visualization of the many-oscillator dynamics plays a crucial                   heuristic role in the research. Several of the tasks are expected               to generate experimentally testable predictions.                                     The mathematical problems studied here are models of                       behavior as varied as the beating of a heart, the patterned                     flashing of groups of fireflies, or the circadian rhythm.                       Specific areas to be studied include: phase models with a large                 but finite number of oscillators; pulse-coupled oscillators with                distributed frequencies or local coupling; phase-locking and                    invariant 2-tori in arrays of Josephson junctions; arrays of                    electronic relaxation oscillators; coupled oscillator models of                 the Drosophila circadian system; and delayed switching                          of charge-density waves.",
