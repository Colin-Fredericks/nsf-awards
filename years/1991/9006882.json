 "awd_abstract_narration": "The herbicide atrazine kills plants by disrupting the                      \"light\" reactions in the photosynthetic pathway.  It works by                   blocking the action of a critical protein (QB) in the electron                  transport chain of photosystem II.  The resistance takes the form               of a modification of the QB protein of photosystem II which                     prevents atrazine binding to the QB protein.  An additional                     effect of this modification of the QB protein is to reduce                      photosynthetic capacity.  This gives us biotypes with high                      photosynthetic capacity (atrazine resistant) and low                            photosynthetic capacity  (atrazine susceptible).  This project                  examines the link between photosynthetic capacity and fitness,                  using atrazine resistant and susceptible biotypes of Abutilon                   theophrasti, a common invader of agricultural fields in Eastern                 North America.  Atrazine resistance is confered by a single                     nuclear gene in this species.                                                        It has classically been assumed that a reduction of                        photosynthetic capacity will translate directly into a decrease                 in plant fitness; however, this assumption has rarely been                      tested.  The fitness consequences of this reduction in                          photosynthetic capacity will be investigated in three                           experiments, all conducted in the absence of atrazine.  The first               will compare resistant and susceptible biotypes of A. theophrasti               grown as well spaced individuals, the second will be an intra-                  specific competition experiment in which A. theophrasti will be                 competed with other commonly occurring weedy annual species.  In                all three experiment, demographic growth analysis, a non-                       destructive indirect method of growth analysis, will be performed               in order to provide a mechanistic interpretation of the link                    between physiology and fitness.",
