 "awd_abstract_narration": "This approximately two-year project targets primarily                           teachers of elementary schools in Texas, and would involve                      teachers of grades 4-6 during the first year and teachers of                    grades K-3 during the 2nd year.  During each yearly cycle,                      24 participants from across the state of Texas will come to                     Concordia Lutheran College, Austin, Texas, for a 4-week                         summer workshop involving classroom, laboratory, and field                      experiences.  During the following school year, the Project                     Director and Senior Associate will conduct four Saturday                        workshops in each of four regions of the state to address                       the expressed needs and concerns of teachers in that region.                    They will also visit each participant's school and assist in                    the implementation of science concepts and methods learned                      during the summer.  Teachers who have completed one year in                     the program will return the for several days during the                         following summer workshop to share their experiences with                       the new group of teachers, and to design school-specific                        plans to radically improve science education in their                           schools.  On one of the workshop days, principals will join                     the teachers to collaborate with and support them in                            developing the plan for their schools.                                                                                                                          This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because it (1) is designed to enhance the science                       knowledge and teaching of teachers by utilizing the local                       environment and focusing on phenomena appropriate for                           elementary school science; (2) contains an amplification                        plan which will accommodate the limitations and                                 idiosyncracies of individual schools while enhancing the                        teaching of science in all of the grades in each school; and                    (3) targets an under-represented (rural) group;                                                                                                                 Non-NSF cost sharing is approximately 8.5% of the amount                        requested from NSF.",
