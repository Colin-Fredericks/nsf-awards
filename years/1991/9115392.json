 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia                           University will continue shipboard technician activities                        associated with the research vessel MAURICE EWING, a 239-foot                   vessel that is owned and operated by the University.  A                         significant portion of Lamont's ship operating schedule in                      recent years and again in during 1991 is in support of NSF-                     sponsored research projects.  The Shipboard Technician                          Program has two components: an at-sea component and an ashore                   component.                                                                                                                                                      The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                         personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;                             maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific instru-                      mentation; instruction and supervision of deck operations;                      and providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going                   scientific parties.  On shore activities include maintenance,                   repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and                    assisting scientific personnel in preparing for field work on                   the vessel.  Shipboard technicians funded by this award have                    broad responsibilities for providing the coordination and                       assistance needed for the successful completion of research                     projects at sea.  The level of activity and amount of support                   are closely related to the size and capability of the vessel,                   and its scientific outfit and capability.",
