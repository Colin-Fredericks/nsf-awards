Although it has been recognized for some                 time that microorganisms are capable of assimilating cyanide as a               source of nutrition, very little is actually known about the                    molecular basis of this ability.  Work in our laboratory has shown              that bacteria capable of utilizing cyanide as a sole nitrogen                   source occur readily in nature, but the mechanism of assimilation               is unknown.  Other investigations have indicated that assimilation              is oxygenase-mediated, but this has yet to be confirmed.  The                   present work is aimed at further defining the metabolic basis of                this ability by (i) chemically identifying conversion products,                 (ii) identifying the kinds of enzymatic activities responsible for              conversion, and (iii) identifying the combination of chemical                   (e.g., radiolabelling, 13C-NMR), biochemical (e.g.,                             biotransformation assays, inhibitor studies, SDS-PAGE) and genetic              approaches (mutant analysis).  New information on the fundamental               microbial basis of cyanide metabolism is expected, which given the              importance of cyanide as both an environmental toxicant and                     participant in prebiotic evolution, is of significant scientific                merit.//",
