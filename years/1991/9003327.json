 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. M. Howard Lee,                       Professor of Physics, University of Georgia, to pursue with                     Dr. Jongbae Hong, Associate Professor of Physics, Seoul                         National University, for a period of 24 months, a program of                    cooperative research on the dynamical behavior of an                            electron gas.  Specifically, the research will address                          problems concerning the frequency or time dependent behavior                    of electron gases, such as critical damping of the plasmon,                     dynamics of a classical electron gas and the fifth moment,                      and dynamics of a layered electron gas.                                                                                                                         The time and frequency behavior of an electron gas at                           metallic densities has been the subject of intense research                     by a number of workers during the past decade.  The present                     cooperative project is based on advances made in research                       under NSF Grant No. INT-8517639 on the time and frequency                       dependent response of an electron gas at metallic densities                     and at intermediate wave vectors.  This research may                            contribute to a better understanding of electronic systems                      in metal-oxide-semiconductors and in heterostructures.  This                    project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea                         Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the                         level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and                     engineers through the exchange of information, ideas,                           skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems                    of mutual interest and benefit.  Support for Korean                             participation in the project is provided by the Korea                           Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
