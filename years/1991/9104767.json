 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is designed to investigate                              experimentally the interaction of a shock wave first with                       homogeneous/isotropic flow and second with a longitudinal or                    traverse vortex in the so called vorticity mode.                                Specifically, the research will focus on the phenomenon of                      turbulence and vorticity amplification across an unsteady                       shock  propagating inside the flow and the                                      distortion/deformation of the shock by turbulence or vortex.                    A shock wave which is formed inside a shock tube, passes                        through a grid and the induced flow behind the shock has the                    features of a compressible flow with free stream                                turbulence.  The decaying turbulence is subjected to                            interaction with the reflected shock and travelling in the                      opposite direction.  In the vortex/shock wave interaction,                      the induced flow over a transverse circular cylinder or a                       small delta wing at incident will generate the required                         vortices with transverse or longitudinal vorticity                              respectively.  Preliminary results indicate that turbulence                     amplification is not the same for all investigated                              turbulence intensities and length scales during interactions                    with the shock waves of the same strength.  The proposed                        program with its unique characteristics will provide the                        opportunity to a number of minority students in Mechanical                      Engineering to participate in an advanced research project                      aimed at a better understanding of compressible turbulence.                     Minority students will be exposed to the-state-of-the-art in                    experimental and computational techniques and, therefore,                       will be encouraged to enter research careers.",
