 "awd_abstract_narration": "Management of pest species in agricultural environments has                become highly technical since the introduction of synthetic                     chemicals as pesticides.  The judicious use of these chemical                   tools, integrated with cultural, mechanical and biological controls             to minimize effects on the environment is an integral part of                   Integrated Pest Management (IPM).  Industry support for a IPM                   research program has been obtained to establish an                              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Integrated Pest             Management at North Carolina State University.                                       The initial research program at the Industry/University                    Cooperative Research Center for Integrated Pest Management will                 address the impact of pest management on environmental quality,                 crop loss assessment and economic threshold determinations, genetic             engineering for improved pest management, improved  understanding               of pest biology and ecology, pesticide resistance detection and                 management, and development of decision support systems for IPM.                     The Principal Investigator and his colleagues are                          internationally recognized researchers that have the capability and             resources to run the Center.                                                         This Center has been coordinated with Dr. F. Heineken, Program             Manager of Biotechnology Program.                                                    The Program Manager recommends North Carolina State University             be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing                 award.                                                                               Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                   and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review             the progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the               following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                     interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to                  which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                  robust research program is developing.  If the review is                        satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support of the                 next period of this continuing award.",
