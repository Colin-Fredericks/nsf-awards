 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the basic mechanisms underlying the perception and                control of pain signals originating from the oro-facial region is               the aim of Dr. Mokha's research program.  While it is known that                the processing of pain signals from the oro-facial region takes                 place initially in the dorsal horn of the medulla (trigeminal                   nucleus caudalis) and is relayed to higher centers of the brain                 involved in the perception of pain,  Dr. Mokha will delineate the               importance of opiates and opiod peptides in modulating pain                     transmission.  These opiates and opioid peptides are morphine                   like compounds localized in these brain regions.  Moreover, he                  will determine the contribution of pathways descending from the                 hypothalamus to the dorsal horn in modulating pain signals                      originating from the oro-facial region.  The new knowledge gained               from these type of work will eventually lead to the development                 of new and better strategies for controlling clinical pain states               such as trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux), migraine and other               debilitating pains associated with spinal cord or peripheral                    nerve injuries and other disease processes.  Understanding the                  neural mechanisms and neurochemicals that underlie the modulation               of pain signals in the dorsal horn should lead to the development               of new non-addictive analgesic drugs for the treatment of pain.",
