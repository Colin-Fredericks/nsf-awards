 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hormones are important physiological molecules which control a                  variety of cellular processes during both development and                       homeostasis of most all plants and animals.  Steroids represent one             class of hormones found in mammals, they are produced by several                small glands as by-products of cholesterol.  Steroid hormones                   circulate through the blood and enter cells by passive diffusion.               The most important mediators of steroid effects are steroid                     receptor proteins, which when bound with the steroid molecule, form             activated complexes that ultimately regulate the expression of                  specific target genes in the nucleus.  The integration of signals               coming from multiple steroid receptor interactions in a variety of              cell types, results in a coordinated response to changes in the                 enviroment.  For example, most steroid molecules differ by only a               few atoms of carbon and oxygen, yet increased stress leads to                   secretion of glucocorticoids signalling the liver to release stored             glycogen while seasonal changes in the weather cause male birds to              alter the production of androgens thereby directly influencing                  certain brain cells that control mating songs.  Recent advances in              the molecular biology of steroid hormone action now make it                     possible to begin studies at the cellular level to investigate the              mechanisms that control these seemingly intricate  responses.                                                                                                   We propose to perform a series of molecular analyses using cloned               androgen and glucocorticoid receptor sequences to identify critical             residues important for binding of these receptors to the regulatory             regions of responsive target genes.  Using three basic approaches               these experiments should:  1) identify the nucleotide sequence of               optimal receptor binding sites on DNA, 2) delineate structure-                  function relationships of the androgen receptor which distinguish               it from the glucocorticoid receptor, this comparative analysis may              reveal important differences between the  receptors would explain               the observed cell-specific effects of these hormones, and 3)                    integrate androgen and glucocorticoid receptor sequences into the               chromosomes of cells that normally lack these receptors and                     determine how this alters their hormonal responsiveness.  We                    anticipate that as a result of these basic studies aimed at                     dissecting the molecular interactions of steroid receptors with                 target gene DNA, we may gain a greater understanding of the                     circuitry which controls complex hormonal responses to                          developmental and environmental cues.",
