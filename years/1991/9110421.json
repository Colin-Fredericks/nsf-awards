New technology in the domain                 of multi-media presentation may allow contemporary theories in                  semantics and discourse analysis to be tested empirically.                                                                                                      The hypothesis to be investigated is that a subject employs a                   process of reduction in perceiving and interpreting a complex                   narrative event, organizing the event into a hierarchy of more                  and less important subevents.  The investigator will develop and                employ a novel methodology based on recording a complex stimulus                event on a video laser disc, and then manipulating the                          presentation of the event to subjects in a variety of ways which                will permit analysis of the subjects' responses.                                                                                                                If the investigation is successful, it will become possible to                  analyze nonlinguistic narrative event structure with a new degree               of precision and insight, and to arrive at a more detailed and                  comprehensive understanding of the relationship between a                       perceived nonlinguistic event and the linguistic expression of                  that event.",
