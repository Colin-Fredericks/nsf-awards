 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large variety of evidence suggests that processing of visual                  objects is done in two separate stages.  The visual system first                parses the scene into visual features such as color, line                       orientation, and direction of motion.  At this early stage of                   processing there is no distinction between features that                        originate from different objects in the scene.  The particular                  visual features of each object in the scene are conjoined at a                  later stage.  The analysis of the visual features at the early                  stage of processing creates a serious problem for the visual                    system.  Given that there is no distinction at the early stage                  between features of different objects, how does the visual system               correctly conjoin features of one object without confusing them                 with features of other objects in the scene?  What is(are) the                  mechnism(s) for feature integration?                                                                                                                            This research follows from the hypothesis that the visual system                uses two different mechanisms for feature integration.  One                     mechanism, the coarse location mechanism, is based on the notion                that visual features are perceived at the early stage with coarse               location information.  The coarse location mechanism integrates                 features with overlapping location information.  This mechanism,                however, is not useful when objects are located spatially near                  each other.  In these situations, a second mechanism, the                       attentional binding mechanism must be used.  The attentional                    mechanism works by marking an area in space and conjoining the                  features present in that area.                                                                                                                                  Separate sets of experiments will examine properties of the two                 mechanisms.  The first set of experiments will explore some of                  the basic characteristics of the coarse location mechanism and                  will show its applicability to everyday situations.  For example,               can the coarse location information detect two targets in                       parallel?  Does it use a simple (linear) activation rule for                    integrating features?  Can it ignore irrelevant features?                                                                                                       The second set of experiments will examine several spatial                      properties of the attentional binding mechanism and will look at                possible connections between the operation of this mechanism and                some of the Gestalt grouping principles.                                                                                                                        This research may lead to mechanisms for simulation of human                    object recognition by an artificial system.",
