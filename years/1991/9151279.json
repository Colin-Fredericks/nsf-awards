 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the development of an introductory solid state                  physics course centered about a semiconductor devices                           laboratory.  The objectives of the course are to involve                        industry as an informal active partner in the educational                       process, and to introduce the student to simultaneous learn-as-                 you-do directed group experiences.The activities of the course                  are designed to allow the student to undergo a project                          development-type experience involving team and individual                       effort and the parallel opportunity to observe, with some                       participation, the same activities in an active industry                        environment.  It is also organized to allow the student to                      interact with the instructor in an educational environment in                   regular laboratory sessions, and in addition to interact                        through sessions at the cooperating industry site with                          scientists and engineers in the industrial setting.The course                   is initially aimed at physics majors and minors, and                            engineering technology majors, with plans to modify it slightly                 for teacher training and field teachers.",
