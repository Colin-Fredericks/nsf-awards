 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study select problems in the               numerical simulation and analysis of wave propagation.  These                   include both the development of improved methods as well as                     applications drawn from fluid dynamics, dynamical systems,                      reaction-diffusion systems and combustion.  Problems in                         methodology to be considered include the construction of accurate               and stable boundary conditions at artificial boundaries for                     computations in unbounded domains, emphasizing error estimation                 and the equations of fluid dynamics, and bifurcation theory                     for points in the essential spectrum, with applications to                      the existence theory of traveling waves in cylindrical domains.                 The study of these problems makes use of the asymptotic analysis                of long range wave propagation, the stability theory                            of initial-boundary value problems, multiple scales expansions                  and extensive numerical experimentation. Applications of these                  methods include the simulation of unsteady compressible flows in                exterior and wall-bounded domains, the construction and stability               analysis of waves modeling the propagation of curved flame fronts               for both thermo-diffusive models and models that include                        hydrodynamic effects, and a numerical investigation of the                      existence of neutrally stable helical waves in pipe flow, as                    predicted by critical layer theory.                                                  Wave motion in fluids and other media is a fundamental                     feature of a variety of disciplines in the sciences                             and engineering, ranging from meteorology to aeronautics to                     oil exploration.  Despite the diversity of the physics, the                     science of waves possesses an underlying mathematical unity, and                has been the subject of intense and fruitful research.                          Modern computing technology has provided a new tool for studying                these phenomena, allowing a deeper investigation of nonlinear                   and multidimensional dynamics.  The research centers on the                     development and application of new computational and analytic                   techniques.  It emphasizes the complementary use of computer                    simulations with other forms of analysis.  The particular                       problems chosen for study arise in fluid dynamics and combustion,               but the universal importance of wave propagation makes the work                 applicable in many other settings.",
