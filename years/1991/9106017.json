 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is a light driven proton pump whose                      function includes two key membrane based processes, active                      transport and energy transduction.  Despite extensive research on               bR and other membrane proteins, the molecular basis of these                    processes is unknown.  Dr. Rothschild's laboratory has developed                an approach based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference               spectroscopy which allows these processes to be investigated at                 the level of single protein residues.  This work is providing                   information about changes in the protonation state and                          environment of specific residues during the bR photocycle.  The                 goal of this research will be to utilize this approach to develop               an increasingly detailed picture of the bR pump mechanism.  These               studies will be facilitated by recent improved methods developed                for time-resolved FTIR difference spectroscopy, polarized FTIR                  and attenuated total reflection.  In collaboration with Dr. H.G.                Khorana's group new methods have been developed, based on site-                 directed mutagenesis, for assigning bands in FTIR difference                    spectrum to the vibrations of individual protein residues.  These               techniques allow the investigation of the sequence of protonation               changes of Asp groups and other residues in the bR proton                       transport pathway; changes in the orientation of the bR alpha-                  helices and changes in pK  of individual COOH groups in the                     membrane.  Parallel studies will be conducted using time-resolved               UV/visible spectroscopy and resonance Raman spectroscopy.  FTIR                 studies will also be continued on two related membrane proteins                 from Halobacterium halobium:  halorhodopsin (hR), a light driven                chloride pump and sensory rhodopsin (sR-I), a phototaxis light                  receptor.",
