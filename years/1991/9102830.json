 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to the Cornell National Supercomputer Facility (CNSF)             in collaboration with the NAtional Center for Supercomputing                    Applications (NCSA) and the University of Alabama at Huntsville for             the 1991-1994 SuperQuest Program.  This is a three year continuing              award to support the integration of computational science and its               tools into the high school science and mathematics curriculum.  A               national competition for high school students and teachers was                  held.  These students proposed the investigation of a scientific                problem and its solution using supercomputing resources.  Judging               was based on scientific content, effectiveness of computational                 approach, creativity and clarity.  The proposals were eleven                    winning teams attending CNSF; for teams at NCSA and three teams at              the University of Alabama.  Each team will consist of three-four                students and a teacher.  The proposed topics range from the                     extinction of the dinosaurs to a study of traffic jams to                       preserving organs at low temperatures.  The SuperQuest teams will               receive training in basic supercomputer usage, programming                      languages, computer graphics and basic numerical methods.  They                 will be aided by supercomputer experts in developing and                        implementing their programs on the centers' supercomputers.                     Workstations will be donated to the schools and the winning teams               will receive technical assistance in setting up the remote                      computing sites.  The students will deliver scientific talks on                 their projects at professional scientific meetings.",
