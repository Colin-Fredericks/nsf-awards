 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Dickel has planned several specific projects to answer                      questions about the structural properties of filaments in supernova             remnants and the generation of their observed emission.  The                    projects include searching for radio wavelength emission from the               remnant SN1885 in the galaxy M31, continuum radio observations at               more than one wavelength from remnants with different ages to                   evaluate their spectra and their particle acceleration mechanisms,              radio wavelength polarimetry to study both the field strength and               the relation of the field structure to the morphology of the                    emitting regions, and some studies of emission measures to                      investigate the depth along the line of sight and relate the                    emission to models of variously shaped emitting features.                                                                                                       Supernova remnants have a variety of structures which can be                    observed in all wavelength regimes from the radio through the x-                ray.  Young remnants show a few very thin optical filaments on the              outer periphery of the shell and then a thicker irregular shell at              radio and x-ray wavelengths.  The older remnants have identical                 radio and optical morphology consisting of a collection of sinuous              filaments in a shell of more diffuse x-ray and radio emission.  The             resolution, sensitivity, and accuracy of modern aperture synthesis              radio telescopes and optical detectors are now giving us the                    opportunity to answer some important questions relating to the                  structures of the remnants of supernovae.  Dr. Dickel's research                program is designed to take advantage of recently available state               of the art instrumentation to examine supernova remnant structures              in detail.",
