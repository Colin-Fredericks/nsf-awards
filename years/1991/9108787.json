 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will exploit parallelism in                          unconstrained structural optimization problems involving Finite                 Element Analysis (FEA).  Typical engineering problems involve                   large finite element models and optimization algorithms take                    several hundred iterations.  Parallel finite element analysis and               optimization cannot be decoupled because calculation of gradients               is closely tied with the function evaluation (FEA), requiring                   proper distribution of data such as global stiffness matrix and                 displacement solution across processors.  Since the total                       computational cost is dominated by the cost of function                         evaluation, methods that result in fewer function evaluations at                the expense of more linear algebraic operations per iteration                   might be preferred.  This might require the calculation of second               derivatives in order to obtain a better quadratic model.  The                   parallelization of linear elastic finite element analysis and                   parallel calculation of first and/or second derivatives will be                 considered.                                                                          In the area of biomechanics, researchers are using                         optimization methods to predict the distribution of material                    properties in the human femur due to the presence of artificial                 implants.  Several theoretical models have been proposed.  A                    typical model would formulate bone remodeling as an optimization                problem where the objective function is strain energy and the                   independent variables are the material properties in each finite                element.  Parallel structural optimization will be used to solve                some problems in this field.",
