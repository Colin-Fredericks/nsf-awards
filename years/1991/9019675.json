 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                     metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Arnold will study                   metal complexes containing sterically hindered tellurolate                      ligands.  The long term goals of the research are to better                     define the coordination chemistry of tellurolate ligands via                    comparisons with related alkoxides and thiolates and, in doing                  so, to provide a rational basis for the design of molecular                     precursors to a variety of potentially useful solid-state                       materials.                                                                                                                                                      Considerable attention has been focused on a range of metal                     compounds incorporating tellurium due to their novel chemical,                  optical and electronic properties.  In contrast to the large                    body of data pertaining to the solid-state properties of these                  materials, however, there continues to exist a large gap in our                 knowledge relating to the chemistry of discrete metal-tellurium                 bonds.  This project outlines work aimed at developing the                      general chemistry of such interactions by studying metal                        complexes incorporating organotellurium ligands.  A particular                  focus of the work is to better define the coordination                          chemistry of tellurolate ligands by probing new synthetic                       routes to discrete, monomeric tellurolate species with bulky                    aryl, alkyl, silyl and related substituents.  This type of                      approach can be compared to recent advances in corresponding                    alkoxide and thiolates, where use of bulky ligands has resulted                 in a much more detailed understanding of the properties of                      metal-oxygen and metal-sulfur bonds. Since relatively few metal                 tellurolates are known, this chemistry will be developed across                 a broad spectrum of main group and transition elements in order                 to address specific questions regarding bonding and reactivity.",
