 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a visit by Dr. Glenn L. Schrader of Iowa                    State University to the University of New South Wales in                        Australia, to work with Dr. H.E. Curry-Hyde to provide new                      fundamental information concerning the mechanism of CO, CO2                     and H2 conversion to methanol using novel Raney Cu-Zn                           catalysts.  Despite the importance of methanol as a large-                      volume chemical intermediate--and the potentially enormous                      demand as an alternate liquid fuel or fuel additive--many                       uncertainties remain regarding the detailed catalytic                           mechanism for methanol synthesis.  New fundamental information                  concerning the reaction pathway would lead to improved                          methanol catalysts and processes.  The Australian researchers                   have discovered a unique series of highly active methanol                       catalysts based on a Raney-catalyst preparational technique.                    Two advanced spectroscopic techniques developed by the United                   States researchers for catalysts research--FTIR reflectance-                    absorbance spectroscopy (IRRAS) and laser Raman spectroscopy                    (LRS), including \"surface-enhanced\" approaches--will be used                    to examine Raney Cu-Zn catalysts which have been prepared,                      characterized, and evaluated for activity and selectivity by                    the Australian researchers.  These studies will contribute                      new information concerning the nature of adsorption and                         reaction on methanol synthesis catalysts and will lead to a                     more fundamental understanding of the nature of the active                      sites.  Specifically, the goals of these studies will be: (1)                   to determine the nature of CO2, CO, H2, and H2O adsorption of                   specific sites on the surfaces of the Raney Cu-Zn catalysts;                    (2) to examine the role of intermediates such as formates,                      formaldehyde, methoxy, or other surface species in methanol                     synthesis; and (3) to distinguish the differences in the                        mechanistic pathways for CO2 and CO conversion in methanol                      synthesis.",
