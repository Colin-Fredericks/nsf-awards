The laboratory will be                developed under the auspices of the Department of Geography at                  the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and will consist of a local                  area network (LAN) comprised of a file server and several                       workstations, with appropriate printers and other peripherals                   attached as shared resources.  This laboratory will be primarily                devoted to meteorological data display and analysis using the                   NSF-funded Unidata data stream and PC-McIDAS display and                        analysis software.  Through the campus computing network, the                   meteorology laboratory will be joined to a geographic information               systems (GIS) laboratory that will allow students to analyze and                display meteorological, climatological and geographic data in                   non-traditional ways.  The synergistic relationship of the                      laboratories will create a unique environment for innovative                    undergraduate education and research.  Existing courses in                      meteorology-climatology will be improved by the additional                      computer equipment and the expanded capabilities will allow new                 courses to be developed.  The coupled meteorology-climatology and               GIS laboratories will allow an emphasis on the inseparable                      nature of the physical world and societal activities in the                     department's courses and will provide a model program for other                 departments around the country.",
