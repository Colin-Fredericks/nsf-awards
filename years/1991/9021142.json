 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regulation and determination of cell fate are fundamental to                    development. Identification of selector genes in Drosophila                     allows description of these elusive phenomena in terms of gene                  expression. Expression of a particular selector gene selects a                  particular pathway of development. Selector gene expression must                change when cells change their fate in response to environment                  (regulation), whereas selector gene expression must be stably                   maintained when a cell and its progeny are committed to a pathway               of development (determined). Expression of engrailed, a selector                gene, commits cells to the posterior compartment of a segment,                  but expression is not initially stable. Cell-cell signalling in                 very young embryos appears to represent regulative control of                   engrailed expression. Subsequently, engrailed expression appears                to be stabilized as it comes under the influence of two later                   tiers of control. As a paradigm for the processes of regulation                 and determination, Dr. O'Farrell is examining engrailed                         expression. He will define when and where determination of                      engrailed expression occurs. He will explore the involvement of                 autoregulation and candidate \"maintenance genes\" in the                         stabilization of engrailed expression. He will map engrailed                    regulatory sequences that mediate regulative and determinative                  programs of expression. From this base he will study the                        molecular mechanisms of regulation and determination in                         development.",
