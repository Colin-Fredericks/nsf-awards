 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports exploratory research on the political and legal             culture of the Soviet Union.  The political culture of the Soviet               Union is experiencing profound strains.  In part, these are the                 cause, and in part an effect, of the dramatic convulsions taking                place in the politics of that country as it attempts the difficult              transition from authoritarian government and socialist economy to               democracy and markets.  This research examines the linkages between             public opinion, political change, and the process of                            democratization.                                                                                                                                                This project is structured around national surveys of public                    opinion and political elite attitudes to be conducted in the Soviet             Union in mid-1991.  The research will provide the basis for                     developing a profile of the major attributes of Soviet legal and                political culture, permit the testing of hypotheses about the                   origins of and recent changes in Soviet values, and facilitate                  comparisons of the differences in value content and structure                   between the Soviet Union, Western Europe and the United States.                                                                                                 When completed this research will provide valuable evidence for                 understanding the changes underway in the Soviet Union.  It should              facilitate assessments of the distance the Soviet Union has                     traveled down the road to democracy and whether it is likely to                 continue moving along that road.  More generally, this research                 should help us understand the role of political culture in                      processes of democratization and global change.",
