Specimens will be pinned or layered in              the field, shipped to a processing center for labeling, sorting,                etc., and then sent to experts for identification.  Data from                   specimens will be computerized after determination, and specimens               will be deposited in major collections equally in the United States             and in Mexico.  Mexican scientists and students will be used in                 field work and some trained in bee systematics.  Checklists, field              guides, descriptions, and keys to the bees of Mexico will be                    produced and published in Spanish and/or in English.  Other                     systematic and evolutionary work stimulated by this inventory will              be completed and published at the convenience of various experts                involved.  The large and extraordinary bee fauna of Mexico will                 become well represented in collections available to scientists in               ecology, plant biology, evolution, zoogeography and other                       disciplines.  A well curated and determined collection of native                bees will be established in Mexico and Mexican personnel will be                trained to curate this collection and to make scientific use of                 it.  This inventory will be of great scientific value to                        systematics, as well as being timely because of current destruction             of natural habitats in Mexico and the recent introduction of the                Africanized honey bee into Mexico.",
