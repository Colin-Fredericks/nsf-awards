 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study involves the use of microsporous membranes for the                   separation of whole and broken cells from proteins and other                    soluble molecules present in fermentation broths and cell                       homogenates.  Its primary objectives are to provide a                           predictive understanding of cake and membrane fouling, which                    lead to a reduced efficiency of the separations process, and                    to use this understanding to develop novel strategies to                        overcome the detrimental effect of fouling.  A new theory,                      which includes the mechanism of shear-induced hydrodynamic                      diffusion, is used to describe the reductions in permeate flux                                                                                                  and protein transmission due to simultaneous cake buildup on                    the membrane surface and adsorption fouling within the                          membrane structure.  When the equations of motion are                           integrated across the cake layer and the concentration-                         polarization boundary layer, this theory takes the form of an                   integral model and is solved using the method of                                characteristics.  In addition to describing the transient and                   steady-state behavior of crossflow microfiltration separation                   processes, the theory predicts desired operating conditions                     under which little or no cake layer of rejected cells is                        expected to form on the membrane surface.  Complementary                        experimental research has tow primary thrusts.  The first is                    the development of protocols to measure physical parameters                     required in the theory.  These parameters include the membrane                                                                                                  and cake permeabilities and selectivities, and a crossflow                      integral which involves the concentration dependence of the                     diffusivity and viscosity of the suspension being filtered.                     The second thrust involves testing and improving the theory by                                                                                                  measuring permeate flux, protein transmission, cake buildup,                    and membrane fouling.  Experiments are performed with rotary                    and conventional crossflow microfilters containing polymeric                    and ceramic membranes, and using model suspensions for latex                    beads and complex suspensions of bacterial and yeast                            fermentation broths and cells homogenates.  The results of                      this research are helping to advance the application of                         membranes for separations in environmental, chemical, energy,                   microelectronics food, beverage, and pharmaceutical                             industries.  Applications to the production of pharmaceuticals                                                                                                  are especially significant, as the knowledge gained may be                      used to design membrane separations systems which yield high                    recoveries of valuable protein products.",
