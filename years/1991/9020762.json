 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iowa State University established a UNIDATA system using                   State funds.  The system will be enhanced under this award.                     UNIDATA plays an important role in the teaching and research                    programs for both the atmospheric science and agricultural                      meteorology programs.  For example, the jointly taught                          Introduction to Meteorology course with a yearly enrollment in                  excess of 800 students uses McIDAS products in the weather                      discussion which begins each lecture.  Several research projects                depend upon \"real-time\" data input including a project which uses               upper-air data, radar observations and satellite imagery in an                  operational forecast mode to predict insect pest movements in the               boundary layer.                                                                      The equipment to be acquired will accomplish five main                     objectives:  1. Update the four IBM PS/2 model 60 computers with                three IBM PS/2 model 70 computers.  This will allow Iowa State                  University to continue receiving McIDAS weather products after                  the UNIDATA support for the DOS  version of PC-McIDAS terminates;               2. Obtain networking software (TCP/2) for the OS/2 operating                    system for the IBM PS/2 model 80 (which will act as the                         ingester) and the four model 70's; 3. Obtain PC X-Window                        software to use with the existing IBM PS/2 model 60 computers as                X-Window systems.  An existing Sun 3/160 which now manages                      UNIDATA SDM will act as the X-Window server; 4. Add a 700                       megabyte hard disk unit to improve the ability to archive McIDAS                and SDM products; 5. Initiate the introduction of COMET computer                based learning models as an educational resource for                            undergraduate and graduate instruction at the university and to                 foster synergism between the UNIDATA and COMET Programs.",
