 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mammals in the carnivore family Procyonidae all live in                the New World and all are arboreal (tree-climbing) to some                      extent.  Up to four of the five living genera coexist in the same               forests in Central and South America, but little is known about                 their habitat requirements or the way the forest is apportioned                 among them.  The P.I. has studied the limb anatomy and limb                     kinematics of these animals in an attempt to understand the                     diversity of biomechanical solutions to be problems of food                     acquisition, escape from predators, and movement through a                      complex, three-dimensional habitat.  These lines of inquiry have                led to several hypotheses regarding the functional and ecological               significance of procyonid locomotor patterns, limb proportions,                 and food-handling behaviors that require field work to test.                    Studies of muscle structure and measurement of museum specimens                 are not sufficient to elucidate the radiation of this taxon into                a wide range of adaptive types.  This planning grant is designed                to investigate the feasibility of locating, radio-tracking, and                 capturing the lesser known procyonids to obtain data on (1)                     movement patterns and habitat use in the field, (2) limb use                    behaviors (locomotion and food handling) of wild animals under                  field and laboratory conditions, and (3) the extent to which                    differences in locomotion and food-handling abilities prevent                   overlap in habitat use by procyonid genera and species.",
