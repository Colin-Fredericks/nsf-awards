 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to test the role of                   microorganisms in mediating interactions among phytophagous                     insects, their host plants and their natural enemies.                           Specifically, the proposed research will determine how endophytic               fungi (fungi that produce asymptomatic infections within plant                  tissues)  affect colonization, dispersion, and population                       dynamics of leafmining and leafchewing insects that feed on a                   common host plant, Emory oak.  Although endophytic fungi are                    thought to be plant mutualists by deterring other herbivores,                   accumulating evidence suggests that their effects on phytophagous               insects are highly variable.  The proposed research will test the               direction and magnitude of these effects through a series of                    field and laboratory experiments and observations.  Ecologists                  have recently recognized that the pervasive effects of                          microorganisms such as endophytic fungi may alter conventional                  theories of phytophagous insect - host plant - natural enemy                    interactions.  By rigorously examining the effects of endophytic                fungi, the proposed research will test and modify these                         conventional theories.",
