 "awd_abstract_narration": "The studies proposed here come from early work by the principal                 investigator showing that large reproducible structural                         features could be seen by electron microscopy in RNA obtained                   from the RNA coliphages M12 and MS2.  These studies suggested                   that the structures that were seen by electron microscopy in                    the RNA might represent base pared regions that were unusually                  stable.  The location of these structures within the viral                      genetic map further suggested that they might play a role in                    regulating viral gene expression in infected cells.  Recently                   the PI has been examining the structure of related coliphage                    RNAs by electron microscopy in order to identify conserved                      structural features; conserved features are expected to have                    functional significance in infected cells.  The conformation                    of genomic RNAs from the bacteriophages MS2, GA, Qbeta and SP                   were examined.  These bacteriophages represent 4 major viral                    groups.  A large central loop is conserved in all four RNAs and                 a model was developed at the nucleotide level for 780                           nucleotides of this loop in Qbeta.  The structure of the loop                   has been confirmed using biochemical methods.  The loop is one                  of the most stable features (resistant to denaturation) seen                    by electron microscopy in all of the phage RNAs.  The structure                 and function of this loop will be studied in more detail by                     genetic analysis.  In addition, the PI proposes to develop full                 models at the nucleotide level for the RNAs of the related                      coliphages SP, Qbeta and MX1 using electron microscopy,                         comparative sequence analysis, biochemical probing, and                         computer modeling.  The genetic studies are being done in                       collaboration with Don Mills, Department of Microbiology and                    Immunology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center.  The Mills lab has                   developed a genetic system for isolating and growing  mutants                   of Qbeta carrying large deletions by supplying the wild type                    viral protein in trans.  The have shown that deletions in some                  regions of the viral replicase gene cannot be complemented with                 viral replicase that is supplied in trans and have called these                 regions cis-acting RNA elements.  The PI believes that these                    mutants define regions in the genome where the structure of the                 RNA is important.  The conformation of the mutant RNAs will be                  examined both by electron microscopy and with biochemical                       methods.  In addition, this type of analysis will be extended                   to the conserved central loop region that is described above.                   It is hoped that the information obtained by our analysis will                  prove useful not only in understanding the                                      functional significance of structure in coliphage RNAs, but                     will also help in understanding the role of RNA structure in                    other genomic viral RNAs and in cellular messenger RNAs.",
