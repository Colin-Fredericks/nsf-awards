 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed one year project will explore high performance                architectures applicable to realizing optical WAN switches.  Some               of the major drawbacks of currently proposed high speed \"optical\"               switches are the need for rapidly tunable transmitters or receivers             requiring fast control for contention resolution and for                        transmitter-receiver coordination.  Alternatively, current                      architectures based on the use of fixed transmitters and receivers,             as in a Shuffle, result in good performance only for homogeneous                traffic patterns and do not smoothly adapt to component failures.                    The principle of the proposed solution is the use of                       wavelength or frequency routing, in a way which trades the high                 bandwidth of these technologies for simplifying the processing and              hardware switch requirements.  the proposed solution integrates                 time oriented control with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)               targeted to overcome the above limitations.  The objective of the               one year effort will be to explore the major issues that restrict               WDM/TDM (time division multiplexing) operations and propose a                   preliminary switch architecture.  The operation of the proposed                 system will be evaluated through simulation to provide a                        quantitative measure for evaluating the future potential of the                 proposed approach.",
