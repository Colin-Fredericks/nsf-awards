 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will use the fossil record of four separate marine              inundations of eastern Kentucky to test for community persistence               on a time scale of 10  - 10  years.  Each marine inundation                     resulted in the establishment of benthic habitats that were                     colonized by the same or similar species of marine invertebrates                and preserved as layers of fossiliferous shale.  Four marine units              will be sampled with replication at multiple locations to obtain                complete fossil species abundances for each sample.  The                        lithological and microfaunal characteristics of each sample will                be used to determine which samples formed in comparable habitats.               Samples from comparable habitats will be statistically compared.                Replicate samples will provide an estimate of variation due to                  sampling that will form the basis for judging the significance of               variation between localities within a marine unit.  Statistical                 tests comparing multiple localities within a marine unit will                   demonstrate the geographic pattern of variation in community                    structure that existed during each marine inundation.  The                      variation in species abundances seen within each marine unit will,              in turn, provide a basis for judging whether the same community                 structure was reassembled after major disruptions and persisted                 through some or all of the marine inundations.  The project is                  designed to rigorously test (a) whether fossil assemblages                      represent communities in a more highly structured sense than just               the coincidental co-occurrence of component species, and (b)                    whether fossil communities (as represented by fossil assemblages                from particular habitats) persist through time despite major                    disruptions.",
