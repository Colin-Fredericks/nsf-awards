 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent changes in family arrangements and employment patterns have           renewed scholarly interest in the behavior of family members and in the         ways that family members make locational decisions, both individually           and collectively.  Some of the most abrupt shifts in householders'              behavior comes immediately after a child is born.  This project will            analyze the impacts of the birth of a child on the activities and               responsibilities of a sample of San Diego metropolitan household                members, paying special attention to the ways that individuals' alter           their use of time.  Impacts on spatial behavior, including changes in           places of work, commuting patterns, and shopping behavior, also will be         examined.  Data will be gathered through a series of questionnaires to          be administered annually over a five-year period to members of a large          number of different types of households.  These questionnaires will             elicit data on household member's daily activities, on their family and         other responsibilities, and on their mobility.  Qualitative and                 statistical analyses of these data will be complemented by detailed             time-budget surveys of a subsample of families taken at three times for         each family (before the birth of a child, immediately after the birth,          and four years later).  One of the largest health-maintenance                   organizations in the San Diego area is providing additional financial           and in-kind support to assist in completion of this project.                       This project should provide valuable new information about the ways          that members of different types of household alter their use of time and        their behavior in space after the addition of a child to the family.            Data from the questionnaires, time-budget surveys, and interviews will          provide new insights about changes in behavior resulting from abrupt            transformation of families and about the relationship of those changes          to family members' attitudes and feelings and to associated geographic          conditions.  Resulting analyses should also provide new information             about broader issues of household formation and persistence, home-work          relationships for family members, and gender differences in temporal and        geographic adjustments.",
