He is scheduled to present                      a paper on \"A Goal Seeking and Obstacle Avoiding Algorithm                      for Autonomous Mobile Robots.\"  This topic relates to his                       research interests in sensor based navigation, map                              building and control systems for these devices.  The                            investigator plans to meet with professors at Osaka                             University and research institutions in Japan that have                         work underway on mobile robots.  These contacts are                             expected to assist him in developing his own research                           program.  His participation in the workshop and other                           contacts in Japan are also expected to assist the                               Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in developing a                         robotics component to its initiative on research relating                       to productive and environmentally acceptable ways of                            utilizing coastlines of the United States for waste                             management.",
