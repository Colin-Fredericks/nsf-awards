National Engineers Week is               a public program conducted by the engineering community in America.             Over the last forty years, it has evolved into a popular and highly             visible program with a special emphasis on student outreach                     activities. The National Engineers Week Committee provides print                and audio-visual materials to engineers participating in Discover               \"E\" teach-ins and other public outreach activities.  By such                    support for this effort, NSF will join more than 30 companies,                  engineering societies and government agencies in underwriting the               costs of the program.",
