 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on the distributions and physical                     properties of molecular and atomic clouds in galaxies and their                 relations to star formation.  The molecular clouds are traced                   by millimeter wave emission from carbon monoxide, and the                       atomic gas is seen via 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen                    (HI).  The distributions of star forming regions will be                        determined by observations of ionized hydrogen.  This research                  will address the specific problems of: (1) the effects of                       spiral density waves on the molecular clouds and the local star                 formation efficiency; (2) the physical properties of the                        molecular gas in the nuclei and disks of late-type galaxies;                    (3) the evolution origin of the interstellar medium in                          lenticular galaxies; and (4) the role of HI in molecular cloud                  shielding within dwarf irregular galaxies.                                        This work will lead to an improved understanding of the                       global and local processes which regulate the star formation                    histories of galaxies.  The project also furthers VPW program                   objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance their                  careers in science or engineering through research, and to                      encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas through                  the investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the                    host campuses.  In this project, the proposed activities which                  contribute to the second objective include: leading an advanced                 topics seminar on radio astronomy; teaching, \"Galaxies and                      Cosmology\", an astrophysics course for junior and senior                        physics majors; involving at least one student per semester in                  some aspect of the research; teaching Introductory Physics                      laboratories; and delivering general colloquia.",
