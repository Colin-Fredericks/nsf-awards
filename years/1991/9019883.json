 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to assess the potential of freshwater                 wetlands to accumulate anthropogenic sulfur.  The work is                       predicated on the observation that under certain circumstances,                 stable sulfur isotope analysis can distinguish the origin of                    sulfur compounds within sediments.  These analyses, combined with               precise measurements of sulfur pool sizes and sulfate reduction                 rates, can determine if and to what extent, sulfur is                           accumulating within wetland peat, in what form, and from what                   source.  Both a modeling and an experimental approach (including                laboratory and whole watershed manipulation) are used to detail                 the important processes affecting sulfur cycling.                                    The total sulfur pool is considered as three separate                      subfractions: reduced inorganic sulfur (RIS), organic ester                     sulfate (ES), and organic carbon bonded sulfur (CBS), and                       analyzed for pool size, stable sulfur isotope ratio, and rate of                formation and breakdown.  The role of organic substrates and                    sulfate concentration in controlling the rate of reduced sulfur                 formation is also examined.  The bulk of this research will be                  carried out in a well studied wetland in the New Jersey                         Pinelands.  An important adjunct to this research will be                       participation in an interdisciplinary and international research                effort called HUMEX in Norway.  HUMEX is a whole watershed                      acidification of a Sphagnum-dominated wetland and humic lake that               is similar to wetlands and surface waters in the Pinelands.                          The results from this study will make important                            contributions to ecosystem ecology by  1) documenting the                       importance of wetland S biogeochemical cycling in regulating                    watershed S flux,  2) providing the first direct evidence on the                long-term storage products of dissimilatory sulfate reduction in                freshwater wetland peat,  3) identifying the important processes                regulating S flux in wetland peat, and  4) testing the                          generalizability of these mechanisms to other systems.                               Dr. Morgan is a leading wetland ecosystem scientist with                   expertise in sulfur biogeochemistry.  The facilities for this                   research are outstanding.",
