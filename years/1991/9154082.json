 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42                U.S.C. 1862, Secs. 3.a.5, 3.a.6.), directs the Foundation                                                                                                            ...to evaluate the status and needs of the various sciences                and fields of engineering as evidenced by programs, projects, and               studies...and to take into consideration the results of such                    evaluations in correlating the research and educational programs                undertaken or supported by the Foundation...                                                                                                                         ...to provide a central clearinghouse for the collection,                  interpretation, and analysis of, and the current and projected need             for, scientific and technical resources in the United States, and               to provide a source of information for policy formulation by other              agencies of the Federal Government....                                                                                                                               In support of this mandate, the Office of Studies, Evaluation,             and Dissemination (OSED) of the National Science Foundation's                   Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), serves as a                major source of research, policy information, and appraisals for                strengthening science, mathematics, and engineering education in                the United States; and, to provide evaluative, analytical, and                  policy support for the leadership efforts of the Foundation in                  these critical areas.  OSED is charged with the responsibility of               evaluating education programs conducted by the National Science                 Foundation, coordinating evaluation of all federal mathematics and              science programs, and with reporting to the Congress and to the                 Nation on the condition of science and mathematics education in the             United States.                                                                       OSED conducts evaluations and prepares reports, summaries, and             analyses on science and mathematics education in elementary,                    secondary, and postsecondary schools through the analysis of                    domestic and international sample surveys of education which have               been supported wholly or in part by NSF or by other federal                     agencies.  It prepares statistical charts, graphs, tables, and text             for publication as requested and for official NSF publications.                      OSED requires assistance in conducting evaluation studies of               NSF programs and in preparing statistical reports on the condition              of mathematics and science education.  These projects require                   specialists in designing surveys of program participants, research              assistants to conduct data entry and data analysis using computer               statistical programs (such as SAS, SPSS, Systat, Minitab, LOTUS                 123, and EXCEL) for evaluation projects, advice from consultants                who are specialists in conducting analysis of large data bases, and             assistance from research assistants for data entry for development              of questionnaires and statistical data.  Also, OSED requires                    assistance in holding large conferences to design studies of                    mathematics and science education or to discuss the implications of             major national studies that are underway.  The contractor would                 assist OSED in preparing the plans and agenda for the meeting and               in arranging travel of participants.  Also, the contractor would                help OSED exhibit the programs and products of NSF at about 10                  conferences throughout the United States.//",
