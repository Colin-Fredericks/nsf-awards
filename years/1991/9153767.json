 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, sponsored by SUNY College at Fredonia, is a                       three year project working with 50 middle school teachers                       from the local school districts.  The teachers will be taught                   science content and pedagogy skills to prepare them to                          deliver an interdisciplinary curriculum based upon the New                      York State Middle School Sciences Syllabus.  In addition to                     the summer program there will be an academic year follow-up                     program.  In total teachers will spend almost 5 1/2 weeks                       each year on the project.  The project topics will include                      units on computers and technology based instruction teaching                    of, problem solving and inquiry skills, student centered                        hands-on activities and leadership development.  In addition                    to support from the college the project is supported by a                       collaboration of organizations including the local school                       district, the regional Board of Cooperative Educational                         Services and the Chautauqua Teachers Center.                                                                                                                    The matching funds provided by the college and the local                        school districts are equivalent to about 10% of the NSF                         grant.",
