 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for Dr. Alexander Murphy through the           National Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Program.          The objective of this program is to provide research support for some           of the nation's most outstanding and promising young science and                engineering faculty members.  The awards are intended to improve the            capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand for           highly qualified scientists and engineers for academic and industrial           research and teaching.                                                               This award will allow Dr. Murphy to continue his research in               political geography on evolving regional structures and ideologies in           the Europe and other parts of the globe.  He plans to pay special               attention to development of critical locales within the European                Community, starting with Brussels, a city that has played a central             role in the integration of Western Europe and that likely will undergo          dramatic transformation in the next decades.  In addition to studying           the role and relationships of specific places within dynamically                redefined regions, the investigator also will examine the                       concentration of power within central institutions that exert great             influence within regions, and he will explore the implications of such          concentrations on human use and misuse of the natural environment.              Studies of regional structures and water allocation in the Pacific              Northwest of the U.S. will be followed by analyses of water use and             pollution in along the Scheldt River of north central Europe, thereby           enhancing understandings of the environmental impacts of regional               restructuring.",
