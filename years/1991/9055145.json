Students will be exposed to these several disciplines through an                on-campus program and follow-up activities that use a \"Science-                 Technology-Society\" (STS) approach and which focus on STS issues                of immediate relevance to the students and their respective                     communities.                                                                                                                                                    The program will also include field trips, career awareness                     workshops, literature to parents on preparation for careers in                  science and engineering, seminars on the contributions of                       American Indian, Latin American, African, and Asian societies and               minority and female scientists to science and technology.                       Examination of the philosophical and ethical aspects of society-                science interface is an inherent and integral part of the STS                   model, and will be a part of the students' projects.",
