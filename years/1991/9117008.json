 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific data types show promise for support of scientific                    computing at all computer system levels, from programming and                   visualization tasks, through compiler and database technology, to               operating systems. Rather than having a distinct data type                      mechanism at each level, this project concentrates on a                         coordinated approach across the levels of compiling, data                       management and operating systems, centered on database support                  for scientific data types. Key aspects of the project are the                   development and deployment of a Hybrid Data Manager as a software               substrate for rapid experimentation in coordinated data type                    support across these layers. The HDM uses object-oriented                       database technology to build a powerful front end for data type                 instances residing in other storage systems. Existing datasets,                 as well as newly created objects are to be supported using a                    staged approach that can lend some support to existing codes                    while providing full data type support for newly created                        applications. An important phase of the project is the deployment               of the HDM on applications in current use in two scientific                     domains, computational molecular chemistry and microstructure                   property predictions in materials science. The experience gained                in this project will provide input in the design of a new                       generation of database systems that will better support the space               and modeling demands of scientific applications as well as                      integrate tightly with compiler and operating system components                 for increased performance.",
