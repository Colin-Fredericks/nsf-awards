Utilizing Dr. Hanson's method of testing mosquito eggs for                      their cold hardiness and Dr. Takahashi's expertise on Aedes                     mosquitoes, the team will study the developmental physiology                    and genetics of Aedes mosquitoes.                                                                                                                               The Aedes albopictus mosquito, a carrier and transmitter of                     dengue fever, Venezuelan Equine encephalitis, La Crosse                         encephalitis, and many other Asian and New World diseases,                      was recently introduced to the North and South American                         Continents.  Almost all efforts to control its spread in the                    Americas have been unsuccessful.  In order to determine how                     far north in North America this mosquito can become es-                         tablished, it is important to study how hardy the eggs of                       this mosquito are in colder climates.  Hanson and Takahashi                     plan to focus their research on the cold hardiness of                           different strains of Aedes albopictus and to genetically                        analyze the mode of inheritance of cold hardiness for this                      mosquito.",
