 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is to develop a model                     system for the study of the mechanism by which egg associated                   factors modulate sperm cell function and, potentially, regulate                 fertilization. Speract, a peptide isolated from the jelly coat                  which surrounds the egg of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus                    purpuratus, binds to specific receptors on the plasma membrane of               homologous sperm cells and initiates changes in sperm cell                      behavior and metabolism.  Previously, Dr. Dangott identified and                purified a 77,000 Mr glycoprotein as the speract receptor. A full               length cDNA clone has been isolated which codes for the receptor                protein. Using antibodies, nucleic acid probes and recombinant                  speract receptor proteins now available in his laboratory and                   others to be prepared, he proposes 1) to express recombinant                    speract receptors in heterologous cells in order to test and                    analyze the protein's function as a peptide receptor and signal                 transducer, 2) recombinant chimeric receptor proteins will be                   engineered and expressed by standard molecular biological                       techniques in order to characterize the structural basis for the                receptor's peptide binding specificity and interaction with                     putative components of the signalling system, 3) prepare                        polyclonal antibodies to the speract receptor in rabbits that                   will be used to purify the receptor from sperm plasma membranes,                and 4) proteins associated with the receptor will be identified,                purified and primary amino acid sequence determined. The proteins               will be characterized for any biochemical activities and                        evaluated for any role in possible signal transduction pathways.",
