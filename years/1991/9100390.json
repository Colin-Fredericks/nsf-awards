 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Keck Consortium in Geology proposes to recruit nine                    minority students each year for inclusion in two of the                         Consortium's undergraduate field research projects during 1991-92               and 1992-93. The students will have completed their sophomore                   college year and will be supported on their home campus by an on-               campus faculty sponsor.  The students will spend three to four                  weeks in the field and one to two weeks writing and illustrating                a final report covering their field research project.  The                      results of their effort will be reported in poster session format               at the annual Keck Research Symposium in Geology.  One research                 project for 1991-92 will be located in Quetico Provincial Park,                 Ontario and will deal with the Precambrian geology along a                      terrane boundary.  The second project will be in Beloit,                        Wisconsin and covers the hydrology of the Turtle Creek drainage                 basin.  The projects for 1991-93 will be located in Gaspe, Quebec               and San Salvador Island, Bahamas and will deal with sedimentary                 processes in clastic and carbonate near-shore environments.",
