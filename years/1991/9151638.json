 "awd_abstract_narration": "A UNIX-based laboratory equipped with Sun SPARC workstations                    will be established for the enhancement of several courses in                   the computer science curriculum at Winston-Salem State                          University.  The computers are used to teach courses in UNIX                    and FORTRAN and provide enhancement for courses in Graphics,                    Numerical Analysis, and System Simulation and Modeling.  They                   also provide facilities necessary for student design projects                   in a Software Development course and in the Computer Science                    Seminar; these projects are taken from areas such as neural                     networks or scientific computing in FORTRAN.  Since these                       workstations replicate the kind of equipment found in                           scientific laboratories across the country, the projects can be                 parts of ongoing research.  This equipment, with its                            interconnections, modems, and links to state networks, give                     students experience in networking.  In summary, it provides                     attractive exposure to the scientific/technical side of                         computer science.",
