 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Herpetology Collection in the California Academy of                    Sciences includes more than 220,000 specimens and 5,000 type                    specimens, and has representatives of more than half of the                     world's known amphibian and reptile species.  The entire                        collection has been entered into a computer database that is                    actively used for managing the collection and for supporting                    specimen-based research.  Dr. Alan Leviton, Curator in charge of                the collection, proposes final validation of the database against               the original label data, and installation of new storage                        equipment for the growing collections of frozen tissues, dried                  skeletons, and whole specimens in alcohol.                                           The proposed curatorial projects will make the collections                 more accessible and usable to the research community.  Final                    verification of the collection database will provide                            investigators with reliable information about which specimens are               available for loan and study.  The database will also provide the               curators with background data for important decisions regarding                 collecting expeditions, donated and orphaned collections, and                   specimen exchange requests.",
