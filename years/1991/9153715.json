 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Northern Colorado will convene a                         conference on the topic, \"Critical Issues in Reforming the                      Preparation of Elementary Teachers in Mathematics and                           Science.\"  at Greeley, Colorado, in October, 1991.                              Participants in the conference will be teams composed of                        science, mathematics, and education faculty and                                 administrators from approximately thirty teacher preparation                    institutions across the country.  A primary  goal of the                        conference will be to disseminate products and                                  programs being developed through NSF elementary teacher                         preparation projects to institutions preparing large numbers                    of teachers who are not active in reform or aware of recent                     developments in the preparation of elementary teachers in                       mathematics and science.  Institutions will be targeted that                    produce large numbers of elementary teachers and are not                        research oriented and/or do not grant doctoral degrees.                         Historically minority institutions and institutions                             preparing large numbers of minority teachers will be                            especially encouraged to attend and will receive advance                        notice of the conference.                                                                                                                                       The program will include invited addresses on pedagogical                       content knowledge, constructivism, and new directions in                        elementary mathematics and science curriculum.  There will                      be panel sessions in which the panelists will be staff of                       major NSF-funded projects and other noted teacher educators                     and researchers involved in reform of elementary mathematics                    and science teacher preparation. Breakout groups will allow                     participants to discuss specific courses and programs with                      panel members.                                                                                                                                                  The University of Northern Colorado is a logical host for                       this conference for several reasons:  (1) A comprehensive                       five-year NSF model project in elementary mathematics and                       science teacher preparation is in its fourth year at UNC.                       (2) UNC is the third-largest producer of first-degree                           certified teachers in the U.S. (3) UNC has important                            contacts to other colleges and universities preparing large                     numbers of teachers through its membership in two important                     reform groups in teacher education, Project 30 and the                          Renaissance Group.",
