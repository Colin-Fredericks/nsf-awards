 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two thrusts to this research.  First, fundamental studies             to characterize the intrinsic kinetics and adsorption parameters                of two key pharmaceutical, insulin and urokinase, in ion exchange,              hydrophobic interaction, and affinity chromatography systems will               be made.  Measurements of the equilibrium isotherms and kinetic                 constants of the pure compounds will be made and the effects of pH              and salt level on the affinities and kinetic constants will be                  investigated.  An existing dynamic column simulation model will be              extended to accommodate gradient systems.  The model will be                    validated with pure component experimental data and then will be                used to study how impurities and products compete for sorbent                   sites.  As a second and supporting thrust the complex interplay                 between biomolecules and sorbent functional groups resulting from               steric effects, hydration, as well as hydrophobic and electrostatic             interactions will be studied.  This research should provide a                   complete description of the configurations of a complex during                  binding, allow quantitative assessment of various intermolecular                forces, and predict the reactive affinities for different                       molecules.  In this way, the understanding of how molecular                     structure affects sorbent selectivity will be advanced.  The                    research will also have a significant impact on the synthesis and               identification of more selective sorbents for biochemical                       separations.",
