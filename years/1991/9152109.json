 "awd_abstract_narration": "Queensborough Community College is upgrading the laboratory                     modern optics component of its technology courses by                            introducing current instrumentation for the study of the                        lasers.  Through laboratory experiments students gain an                        understanding of the principles and measurement techniques                      involved in the study and use of high power lasers.  The                        centerpiece of the laboratory is a mode-locked Nd-YAG laser.                    With the additional of a Q-switch and second harmonic                           generator, a number of experiments cover the principles of                      thermal lensing, acousto-optic modulation and mode-locking, Q-                  switching and non-linear optics (second harmonic generation).                   Along with aligning the lasers and beam profile measurements,                   these experiments provide a practical application of many of                    the principles discussed in optics courses.  By using sampling                  Oscilloscopes and fast photodetectors, students not only                        observe phenomena normally outside the range of observation but                 also gain experience with valuable research tools.  The                         experience provides students who are uniquely equipped to                       either become laser technicians or continue in a four year                      degree program.",
