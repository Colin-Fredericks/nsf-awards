 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will study the stability of specific chemical elements and                   measure the mass of certain types of biological substances and                  embedding materials as a function of irradiation and temperature.               We will use an electron energy loss spectrometer interfaced to a                computer to make quantitative measurements.  While this work is                 going on, we will develop a more efficient data acquisition                     system based on new interfaces and computer programs.  To measure               very cold specimens, we will mount our spectrometer on a special                electron microscope with a superconducting objective lens                       operating at liquid helium temperature.  This will help future                  research efforts because very low temperature will probably                     stabilize some elements, hence improving the accuracy of                        concentration measurements and allowing the use of certain                      chemical elements as site-specific stains.  We will learn which                 elements are \"caged at low temperature or \"frozen\" onto surfaces.               Improved stability of embedding materials will allow more                       accurate three-dimensional views of sectioned specimens.  Studies               of major classes of molecules (like DNA) will indicate which                    materials are most helped by low temperature.  Development of new               instrumentation will improve the efficiency of our studies of                   radiation effects and will allow our techniques to be used more                 widely by other.",
