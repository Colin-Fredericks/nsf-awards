 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teaching Science with TOYS is a  three-year teacher                             enhancement project for K-12 teachers involving faculty from                    the Departments of Chemistry and Physics on the Oxford,                         Hamilton, and Middleton campuses of Miami University as well                    as master pre-college teachers.  The primary project activity                   is a series of Teaching Science with TOYS workshops for K-12                    teachers.  During the summers of 1992 and 1993, the three-                      week workshops will have 40 teachers and eight university                       affiliates from a nationwide pool.  During (1991-92), (1992-                    93) and (1993-94) academic year (AY), regional workshops will                   include 16 teams of 4-teachers each and (2-4) university                        affiliates.  Development activities begin June 1, 1991.  In                     the workshops participants will learn the principles of                         chemistry and physics embodied in commercially-available                        toys; they also learn and practice pedagogical strategies for                   engaging students in physical science education through                         inquiry-oriented, toy-based activities.                                                                                                                         Teachers of grades K-12 will participate as intra-district                      teams to strengthen the presence of hands-on collaborative                      science education in the schools.  Individually and                             collectively they will be dedicated to working together to                      strengthen their content knowledge, to learn pedagogical                        strategies and develop means for applying those strategies                      within their school system's present curriculum, and to                         assume a leadership role within their school system.  Upon                      completing the workshop, these teams will become resource                       persons and conduct peer-led workshops for others in their                      district, thus multiplying the effect of the project beyond                     the scope of the direct participation.                                                                                                                          Three written products will result.  First, a facilitators'                     handbook will be developed to enable University Affiliates                      to replicate the project regionally.  Second, a collection of                   toy-based activity write-ups will be tested and revised for                     use in pre-college classrooms.  These will be used in the                       workshop and incorporated into the Teacher Resource Modules,                    (TRM) the third written product.  The TRM will provide                          teachers with content background and classroom activities to                    supplement their existing science curriculum.  Each module                      will contain a general content review, pedagogical methods                      for applying the content in the classrooms, and related toy-                    based activities.                                                                                                                                               The TOYS program and its materials will be evaluated through                    on-going, multi-step process that will allow continual                          monitoring of progress towards goals.  Special attention will                   be given to evaluating the impact of second generation peer-                    led workshops.                                                                                                                                                  Cost-sharing equals 179% of the NSF award.",
