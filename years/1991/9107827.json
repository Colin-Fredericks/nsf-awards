 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mints, family Lamiaceae, are a large, economically and                      floristically important family.  They have been conceived to be a               \"natural\" family and have been recognized since before Linneaus.                However, recent evidence from studies of pollen morphology and                  floral and fruit morphology suggest that various members of the                 family may have evolved independently from ancestors in the family              Verbenaceae and, therefore, the Lamiaceae would be polyphyletic.                If this is the case, then the Lamiaceae represents an unparalleled              example of convergent evolution.  The use of morphology to                      interpret evolutionary relationships is problematic.  The very same             phenomenon that has been suggested to account for the possibly                  erroneous circumscription of the mint family, convergent evolution,             could also result in erroneous conclusions about relationship.                                                                                                  New sources of data derived from the comparative analysis of the                molecular structure of the chloroplast DNA from both families,                  Lamiaceae and Verbenaceae, will be assessed to interpret the                    pattern of evolutionary relationship among their members.                       Molecular data is much less prone to the misleading effects of                  convergent evolution and has been shown to be effective for the                 reconstruction of evolutionary relationships at this level in                   plants in several recent studies.  Two methods will be employed:                1) restriction site mapping will be used to examine a large number              (ca. 140) of species and 2) direct sequencing of three genes coding             for proteins differing greatly in function from species                         representing the major lineages within the two families.  The very              large data set expected to be derived from this research will be                analyzed using recently developed computer programs designed to                 reconstruct evolutionary history from molecular data.  This                     research will benefit both the fields of plant taxonomy, by                     providing the basis for a revised classification of the families                Lamiaceae and Verbenaceae, and evolutionary biology, through the                rigorous study of an outstanding example of convergent evolution.",
