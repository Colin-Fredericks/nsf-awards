 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates three aspects of long-run economic                    growth: first, the shape of comparative growth over the past                    century, second, the extent to which broad asset price indices -                predominantly stock market indices - forecast actual or expected                future economic growth, and third, possible lessons on the links                between financial structure and growth taught by the comparison of              Great Britain and the United States at the turn of the twentieth                century.                                                                                                                                                        All three parts of this project will extend in significant ways the             baseline of information economists have to draw conclusions about               the relationship between the structure and performance of financial             markets and the shape of long-run growth.  Most importantly, the                first part of the proposal - the improvement, extension and                     analysis of the long term data - will generate a new database.                  This new database would provide a better picture of the shape of                productivity advance in the industrial core of the world economy                and diffusion to the periphery of new settlement over the past                  century.  It would also provide more accurate and reliable data for             future studies of the determinants of long-run growth.",
