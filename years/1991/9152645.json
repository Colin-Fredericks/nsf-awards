The instrument that will be purchased is a Bruker                     High Resolution Fourier transform 1H/13C & nuclear magnetic                     resonance spectrometer system.  This instrument will be used to                 create contemporary examples of proton and carbon NMR spectra                   for use in the classroom teaching of organic chemistry, to                      analyze intermediates, products and unknowns in the                             undergraduate instructional organic laboratory, to present                      contemporary methods for the determination of molecular                         structure in the advanced organic chemistry course, to                          investigate enzyme-catalyzed reaction in biochemistry, and to                   provide opportunities for sophisticated experiments in the                      areas of structure determination, reaction mechanisms and                       kinetics for group projects and in student/faculty research.                    The project includes plans to make data, spectra, and other                     materials obtained with this instrument available to others who                 do not have access to this type of equipment.",
