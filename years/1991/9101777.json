 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                  Program of the Chemistry Division Professor Ortiz will apply                    electron propagator theory to the computation of the electronic                 structure of small molecules. The computations will aid in the                  interpretation of  the electronic structure and bonding of many                 interesting atomic and molecular systems.                                                                                                                       Electron propagator theory provides a correlated one-electron                   picture of bonding through accurate calculations of electron                    binding energies and Feynman-Dyson amplitudes. Improvements to                  existing codes will concentrate on propagator renormalizations.                 Reference state averages will be improved with certain infinite                 order corrections by employing amplitudes from coupled cluster                  singles and doubles calculations. Diagonalization of the                        superoperator Hamiltonian matrix with an algorithm based on                     inverse iterations will result in operator manifold                             renormalizations. Full two-electron transformations will                        facilitate calculations on large molecules and interface with                   other codes. The dependence of one-electron states and energies                 on chain length and on local conformations will be explored for                 polysilane oligomers. Relationships between bond energies and                   ionization energies will be studied for half-sandwhich                          organometallics. Nonresonant emissions in triatomic radicals                    will be considered through calculations of ground and excited                   state potential energy surfaces. Explanations for the                           stabilities of various double Rydberg anions will be sought                     through one electron pictures.",
