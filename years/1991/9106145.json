 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although people have migrated to the U.S. from Asia                        throughout most of the last two centuries, historical and                       geographical studies of immigration and immigrant settlement in                 the United States have focused primarily on European relocation                 to North America.  This doctoral dissertation project will                      examine the migration of the Chinese who came to live in                        Pennsylvania between 1860 and 1920.  Documentary and archival                   research will be used to examine the roles of individuals and                   institutions in the relocation to the U.S.  Special attention                   will be given to the ways that Chinese and American institutions                affected family structures and locational patterns of Chinese                   immigrants.                                                                                                                                                          This project will add to our understanding of the interplay                between individual motivations and institutional elements that                  influence the time and place of migration and settlement.  It                   will broaden our view of the nature of migration and settlement                 in the United States by presenting a balanced view of the                       Chinese, an historically underrepresented ethnic group.  This                   project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a                        promising young scholar to continue to develop independent                      research skills.",
