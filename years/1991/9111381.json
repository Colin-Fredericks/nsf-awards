 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will study iterated             function systems (IFS's) and subdivision algorithms (SDA's) in the              context of dyadic iteration schemes governed by certain functional              equations.  The method of attack will involve analytical and                    numerical techniques that are based upon wavelet theory.  The                   overall research plan has points of contact with the work on                    fractal geometry that is being conducted currently at Georgia Tech.             In particular, the principal investigator will look at the                      following three interrelated aspects of solutions of functional                 equations:  dimension and smoothness, the singularity spectrum and              the inverse problem.                                                                 The analysis of the geometry of sets of fractal dimension                  involves a number of different areas of mathematics, and it is safe             to say that this subject has breathed new life into several parts               of classical analysis.  In this project the principal investigator              will apply techniques from the theory of wavelets to study the                  properties of solution sets of functional equations whose graphs                are fractals.  Her approach will combine analytical and numerical               methods, and she will be collaborating with the leading people in               this work that blends analysis with geometry.",
