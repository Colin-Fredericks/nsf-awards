 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is to clarify the ecology                of two species of frugivorous New World monkeys: Pithecia                       pithecia and Chiropotes satanas.  These two species overlap                     significantly in their distributions and in broad terms utilize                 similar foods.  The pithecines also possess a rather unique                     anterior dental complex with large canines and general                          hypertrophy of the anterior dentition.  How does this dental                    structure relate to physical characteristics of their food                      stuffs? How do the species differ in food choices in their areas                of sympatry?                                                                                                                                                    This research will test a series of linked hypotheses regarding                 the choice and processing of foods by the two species.                          Specifically, the PI will, through both field observation and                   laboratory analysis (1) test the ability of the dentition of                    these species to reduce hard dietary items (2) determine the                    importance of each item to the nutrition of each species (3)                    study the use of the large anterior teeth (especially the                       canines) in food processing as well as the grinding role of the                 molars (4) determine the relative importance of each item to the                diet of the two species.  Through this analysis the researchers                 should clarify the relationship of teeth to dietary choices and                 the role of the later in preventing competition between closely                 related species.",
