 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is the integration of vision and               force feedback for the synthesis and execution of error-tolerant                robot motion plans.  Specifically, a purely geometric                           representation of visual constraints in terms of visual                         constraint surfaces is explored.  A visual constraint surface is                a ruled surface defined by an object feature (such as an edge)                  and its projection onto the image plans of a supervisory camera.                Control schemes are planned to facilitate:  motion that complies                to a visual constraint surface; motion that terminated on contact               with a visual constraint surface; and, motion that is                           simultaneously constrained by visual and physical constraint                    surfaces.  Extensions to existing preimage style motion planners                will make possible the synthesis of motion plans that exploit                   execution-time feedback from vision and force sensors.  While                   much work has been done in the areas of motion planning and                     control with force feedback and motion control using visual                     feedback, to date there has been no reported system capable of                  creating motion plans based on visual feedback or capable of                    integration of both force and vision sensing for motion control.                This research addresses each of these issues.",
