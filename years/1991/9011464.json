 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ovarian steroid hormone, estradiol, regulates physiology and                behavior by actions in the brain.  Estradiol binds to                           intracellular protein receptors found in target neurons within                  the specific neural brain regions.   These steroid-receptor                     complexes then bind to acceptor sites in the nucleus to alter                   gene expression (i.e. induction of RNA and protein synthesis).                  It is the believed that the increase and decrease of proteins                   resulting from this steroid-receptor interaction is the primary                 mechanism of action of the hormone.  While many of the                          physiological, morphological and behavioral effects induced by                  estradiol can be accounted for by this mechanism, recent                        immunocytochemical studies have identified steroid hormone                      receptors in the extranuclear regions of the target neurons.                    This strongly suggests that the hormone also acts through a                     nongenomic process.  Dr. Blaustein will identify other possible                 sites within neurons at which estradiol acts.  Since at the light               microscopic level distinct cellular localization can not be                     readily identified, he will develop an electron microscopic,                    ultrastructural immunocytochemical technique.  Using this                       technique, Dr. Blaustein will determine the extranuclear                        organelles with which the steroid receptors are associated.                     These anatomical studies will significantly enhance our                         understanding of the cellular mechanisms of action of this                      hormone.  A number of studies have linked estradiol with the                    occurrence of various types of cancers.  A better understanding                 of the mechanisms of action could eventually lead to improved                   treatments and possible cures for these life threatening                        estrogen-related diseases.",
