 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is part of an integrated research program into                the oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea.  It is to               be carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR               scientists from February to June 1992.  The work proposed here is               an effort to define the vertical and horizontal thermohaline                    fluxes within the western part of the Weddell Gyre.                             Specifically, instrument clusters capable of measuring the                      Reynolds stress and the turbulent heat flux directly will be from               the ice at the camp and maintained throughout the duration of the               drift.  Also, a remote buoy to measure upper ocean temperature,                 salinity and current structure will be emplaced to make                         observations in the larger scale variability within which the                   turbulence data is embedded, and which can be expected to have                  some effect on the turbulence intensity.  The measurements will                 be used in conjunction with other concurrent experiments to                     quantify the energy brought to the underside of the ice and form                part of the flux of energy from the ocean through the sea ice                   cover to the atmosphere.",
