 "awd_abstract_narration": "An approach to scientific computation is proposed that                     incorporates research in numerical analysis, aspects of computer                science, and solution of model problems in mechanics.  Three                    research areas are the focus of the proposal:   computational                   problems in incompressible fluid dynamics (including                            free-boundary problems, problems with variable density and                      high-order discretizations in three dimensions), computational                  chemistry (molecular dynamics simulations), and automated                       programming of scientific algorithms on parallel computers.  The                overall objective of the proposal is to improve the foundations                 for software for solving problems in science and technology that                involve large scale, multidimensional models involving                          mechanics.  The research will involve the development of new                    algorithms for several problems too difficult to solve by                       existing techniques.  It will also include an analysis of each                  algorithm, yielding a rigorous justification that it accurately                 approximates the phenomena under study. Finally, the proposed                   research will involve prototype implementations of                              the algorithms in computer programs via techniques that can                     assure a robust and easliy maintained code.                                                                                                                     This research will improve computational modeling of many                       important industrial processes.  One class involves such diverse                things as making photographic film, sewing thread, extruded                     metals and Saran Wrap.  Another involves biomedical applications,               for example in the development of new pharmaceuticals.  Another                 impacts the analysis of certain toxic gas spills.",
