 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bermuda Biological Station for Research provides resident and               visiting investigators with laboratory facilities and access to                 unique marine environments.  The Station has an excellent                       reputation for supporting graduate training as well as research.                Unfortunately, Bermuda's appeal among vacationers has made it                   prohibitively expensive for visiting researchers to live off-site,              and the Station's ability to house visitors has been limited.  As               a response to this problem, Dr. Knap, Director of the Station,                  proposes construction of housing for 20 visiting scientists.                                                                                                    The proposed visitor housing will improve the Station's research                impact directly and immediately.  The recent growth in research                 activity will continue to increase, and a greater variety of                    research projects will be attracted to the Station.  Increased                  visitor housing is integral to the Station's long-range plans for               continued leadership in marine studies.",
