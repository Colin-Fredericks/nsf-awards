Soviet scientists will participate in the research performed in                 Washington in visits ranging from 2 to 8 weeks.  Development of                 models for the origin of continental cratons with their massive                 mantle roots has been based in considerable part on                             investigations of xenoliths from southern Africa.  Further                      progress requires comparative study.  The Siberian craton is best               suited because xenoliths are abundant and because extensive                     collections and basic research have been carried out by Soviet                  investigators.  Attention will be focused on low-temperature,                   craton-forming peridotites and on megacrystalline dunites that                  sometimes contain diamonds.  Bulk analyses will permit comparison               of the Karpvaal and Siberian cratons.  Analyses for Os, Sr, Nd                  and Pb will be virtually the first performed on SIberian mantle                 rocks and may provide records of craton evolution that have been                obscured in African xenoliths by post-Archaean metasomatism.                    Insights to the timing and nature of diamond-forming processes                  and to the location and distribution of Re and Os in mantle                     minerals will be sought.",
