 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jaffe will continue to explore the roles of free cytosolic                  calcium pulses, waves and gradients in the development of                       embryological pattern, in cytokinesis as well as in                             fertilization. His broad purpose is to discover and describe                    spatiotemporal calcium patterns which have been conserved in                    evolution and to explore their developmental roles and                          mechanisms. His main method for visualizing these patterns will                 be to inject chemiluminescent, calcium specific proteins called                 aequorins. He will also use vibrating calcium specific electrodes               to explore patterns of calcium currents through cell surfaces. He               will continue this exploration in fucoid, ascidian, Xenopus and                 medaka eggs as well as in some other systems. One of the main                   methods for modifying, and thus for exploring the role of, these                calcium patterns will be to suppress them by injecting                          appropriate calcium buffers. Dr. Jaffe will also modify such                    patterns via appropriate applications of calcium channel blockers               and agonists as well as calcium ionophores. This enterprise                     should prove to be of broad value in understanding cell                         development because calcium ions are among a relatively small                   class of small substances (like hydrogen ions, ATP, cyclic AMP,                 IP3, etc.) whose intracellular patterns are central to the                      physiological control mechanisms within cells.",
