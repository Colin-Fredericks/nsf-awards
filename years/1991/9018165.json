 "awd_abstract_narration": "One goal of research in aeronomy is to be able to determine                the properties of various regions of the upper atmosphere from                  ground-based measurements of airglow emission lines. The                        principal investigators involved in this work have made                         significant progress towards this goal through their past work in               determining thermospheric composition, temperature, and incident                EUV flux from ground-based measurements of twilight airglow                     lines; however much remains to be done to solve the complex                     theoretical modelling and data acquisition problems involved. The               proposed work is a carefully planned continuation of research                   aimed at advancing towards the goal. Development of models                      relating to attainable ground based airglow measurements will                   continue, with corroborative support from satellite                             measurements. The models developed will be upgraded and made user               friendly for use by the CEDAR spectroscopy community. The models                will further be modified and improved to incorporate incoherent                 radar or ionosonde measurements, and to extend their range to a                 global scope.  ***",
