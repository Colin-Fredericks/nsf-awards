 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at Syracuse                 University plans to award research stipends to motivated and                    academically superior engineering undergraduates who have completed             their junior year studies.  The program has both the summer and                 academic year components.  Each year, five of the eight REU                     participants are selected for summer research participation from                applicants from colleges and universities other than Syracuse                   University.  The remaining three students are selected for summer               research participation from the seniors in Mechanical and Aerospace             Engineering at Syracuse University.  A particular focus of                      recruitment effort is to attract qualified participants from                    minority, women, and physically disabled students, both from within             and without Syracuse.  Six faculty members in the Mechanical and                Aerospace Engineering Department have expressed active interest in              supervising the research efforts of the participants.  The areas                in which these faculty members are actively engaged in research                 span experimental and computational fluid mechanics, gasdynamics,               aerodynamics, heat transfer, aeroacoustics, noise control,                      composite materials, and mechanical behavior of fibrous materials.              A REU participant may select a research problem in any one of these             research areas.  For faculty supervision, research participant's                choice of a research project and faculty supervisor's field of                  specialization will be matched.",
