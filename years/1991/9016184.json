The inves-                       tigators intend to carry out research in the area of particle                   and particle-fluid interactions in solid-liquid suspensions.                    Fluidization and sedimentation approaches will be combined                      using red blood cells as a novel source of particles.                                                                                                           One of the problems encountered in the testing of bed                           fluidization theories is the discrepancy occurring as the                       size of the bed particle is reduced to the micron level as                      well as when density differences between the particle and                       the fluid approach unity.  This has been recently addressed                     by the Italian research group.  To date they have been                          limited in these studies with spherical particles with a                        diameter of 1 mm and a density of 1.26 gm/ml.  By incorporating                 the U.S. researcher's approach using erythrocytes, from                         either human or bovine blood, these investigations can be                       extended and provide a new model for particles with little or                   no interactions between them.",
