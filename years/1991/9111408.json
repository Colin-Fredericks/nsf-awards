This magnetochemistry research                       program is devoted to the investigation of the chemical and                     structural features which determine the nature of cooperativity                 in low dimensional compounds, especially systems that have                      unusual structures or exhibit phase transitions.  The                           importance of low-dimensional systems has been demonstrated by                  the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductors, which                 are thought to be propagated through low-dimensional networks.                  New one-dimensional magnetic compounds, mainly bridged Cu(II)                   compounds, will be synthesized and characterized, both                          structurally and magnetically. Observed magnetic properties                     will be correlated with ab initio calculated values.                            %%%                                                                             Low-dimensional systems may have other important properties and                 may find uses in switches, actuators, sensors, display devices                  and in logic circuits. A better understanding of the                            fundamental properties of low-dimensional systems will permit                   the design of substances with prescribed properties.",
