 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigators will work on a                 number of problems in function theory, partial differential                     equations and quasiconformal mappings.  In particular,  Professor               Eremenko will continue his work on problems in holomorphic                      dynamics, specifically complex iteration theory.  He will also                  work on the theory of entire, meromorphic and subharmonic                       functions.  Professor Lewis will continue his work on parabolic                 partial differential equations and symmetry theorems.  There is                 finally joint work planned on a conjecture of Littlewood                        involving entire functions.                                                          The classical fields of partial differential equations and                 complex function theory have a great deal of material in common,                and very often the insights gained from viewing a problem from                  both viewpoints can be especially illuminating.  In this project                the principal investigators will work individually and jointly on               various interrelated problems in complex mappings, parabolic                    partial differential equations and holomorphic dynamics.",
