 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study the mechanism(s) whereby phenolics                     interact with specific receptors to elicit cellular responses.                  An important model system that cues on phenolics as signals is                  Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a pathogenic soil bacterium that                     causes tumors at wound sites of infected plants.  The bacterium                 can transfer DNA (T-DNA) from its Ti plasmid into plant cells                   where it is integrated into the nuclear DNA and expressed,                      ultimately leading to the tumourous growth of the transformed                   cells.  Most of the vir genes of the Ti plasmid that encode the                 proteins involved in the processing and transfer of the T-DNA                   are not expressed until the bacterium receives phenolic                         molecules produced by wounded plant cells.  The putative                        receptor of this signal (VirA) has been identified by genetic                   means as a 92kDa cytoplasmic membrane localized protein.  A                     model has been proposed for the phenol/receptor protein                         association and a description of chemical, biochemical and                      molecular genetic approaches for the characterization of the                    interaction have been provided.  This simple model system                       should provide insight into the mechanisms of signal                            transduction mediated by phenolics.                                             %%%                                                                             With this Chemistry of Life Processes award, the Synthetic                      Organic Program of the Chemistry Division and the Cellular                      Biochemistry Program of the Division of Cellular Biosciences                    will support the research of Dr. David G. Lynn of the                           Department of Chemistry of the University of Chicago and Dr.                    Andrew N. Binns of the Department of Biology of the University                  of Pennsylvania.  The major focus of the research is to study                   the role of phenolics as signal molecules in both eukaryotic                    and prokaryotic organisms.  Important hormones and growth                       factors in both the Animal and Plant Kingdoms fall within this                  class of compounds.  Using the model system Agrobacterium                       tumefaciens, the project will probe the mechanism(s) whereby                    the phenolics interact with specific receptors to elicit                        cellular responses.  The long-range research goals are directed                 towards understanding plant development.",
