A series of laboratory experiments                   will be conducted where artificial stream pools with natural                    bottom substrates will be manipulated to determine the effects of               water depth, surface reflectance, turbidity, and phytoplankton                  density on attached algal spectral reflectance.  Also, an in situ               stream experiment will be conducted to determine the effects of                 benthic complexity and nutrient availability on the cascading                   trophic patterns, which controlled benthic algal biomass in the                 laboratory experiments. Spectral reflectance from all experiments               will be measured using a narrow-band spectroradiometer and                      ground-truth samples will be taken for periphyton chlorophyll                   content and pertinent water quality variables.  Two similar in                  situ stream experiments conducted by other researchers in                       different geographic locations will be sampled in the same way.                 In collaboration with remote sensing experts from the University                of Kansas, University of Nebraska, and Creighton University (NB),               spectral reflectance data from this project will be used to                     develop and refine a spectral reflectance model for periphyton in               streams.",
