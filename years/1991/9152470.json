 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gustavus Adolphus College is enhancing the genetics program                     within the biology department's curriculum by including current                 nucleic acid and protein analyses. Recombinant DNA techniques                   have revolutionized the discipline of genetics, and the College                 has made a major commitment to teach these methodologies to the                 scientists it prepares. At the advanced level, DNA sequencing                   and sequence analysis will be taught in Molecular Genetics, as                  well as other methods of gene analysis. Bacterial                               transformation, plasmid isolation, and DNA restriction analysis                 by electrophoresis will be taught in Genetics, a required                       course for majors. In addition, DNA isolation and                               electrophoretic techniques will be included at the introductory                 level in General Biology. Funds are sought from NSF to aid in                   the acquisition of DNA sequencing units, power supplies, gel                    electrophoresis units, and other support equipment that will                    allow students the opportunity to practice these methodologies.",
