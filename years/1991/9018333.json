 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colicin E3 is a toxic protein secreted by certain strains of E.                 coli in order to eliminate related strains of bacterial living                  in the same ecological niche.  Colicin E3 inactivates the                       protein biosynthetic machinery of the infected cell by nicking                  16S ribosomal RNA at a specific site.  Colicin E3 thus acts                     enzymatically as an endoribonuclease.  The producing organism                   is immune to the toxicity of its own colicin E3 by virtue of a                  \"immunity protein\" which binds to colicin E3 and thus renders                   it inactive.                                                                                                                                                    Dr. Shoham proposed a crystallographic structure determination                  of colicin E3 and its inhibitor, the immunity protein gain                      understanding at the molecular level of the ribonuclease action                 of colicin E3 and its inhibition of immunity protein.  Detailed                 knowledge of the enzyme-inhibitor interactions will also shed                   light on the structure of the ribosome at large, in the                         vicinity of the cutting site.  the immunity protein is one the                  very few known ribonuclease inhibitors.  Its three-dimensional                  structure may provide a basis for the design of other RNAse                     inhibitors with desired specificity.",
