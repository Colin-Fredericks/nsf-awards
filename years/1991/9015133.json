 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a three-year collaborative research project             between Professor Steven N. Handel, Department of Biological Sciences,          Rutgers University, and Professor Andrew J. Beattie, School of                  Biological Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.  The              activity takes place under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science               Program.  The scientists will study the ecology and evolutionary                biology of so-called sexually deceptive plants (plants with flowers             that mimic female insects, thus attracting male insects to mate and             thereby effecting pollen transport).  The mimicry is known to occur             only within the orchid family, and though unusual, it is observed               among hundreds of species in Australia, and to a much lesser extent             elsewhere.  The investigators wish to explore the hypothesis that               the genetic structure of these plant populations is significantly               different from those in which pollination is the result of an insect            foraging strategy based on food rewards (nectar or pollen).                     Specific species of the orchid genus Chiloglottis, pollinated by male           thynnine wasps, will be studied.  Field observations of the wasp                flight movements among the flowers, as well as pollen transfer                  dynamics, will be carried out.  The effects of varying average                  inter-flower distance and flower height on pollinator behavior will             be investigated.  In addition, plant samples will be taken from                 representative populations in the field and their genetic profiles              determined, using the technique of gel electrophoresis. Correlations            between the observed pollination patterns and gene flow in these                species will be sought.  This research in evolutionary ecology will             provide an independent test of current theoretical generalizations              that insect movement patterns determine the genetic structure of plant          populations.  In addition, the work has implications for the                    conservation of these orchids, some of which are endangered species.                                                                                            The cooperating scientists in this project bring complementary                  research strengths to the study.  Professor Handel's expertise is in            plant ecology, especially pollination biology and gene flow dynamics.           Professor Beattie has considerable experience in population genetics            and the biochemical analysis of plant populations.  The field                   studies will be carried out at selected Australian locations, and               the laboratory analyses performed at Macquarie University, in Sydney.",
