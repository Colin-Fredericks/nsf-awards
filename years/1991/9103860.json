 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aromatic compounds are abundant in the biosphere as a major                     polymeric component of plants (lignin) and as toxic by-products of              human industrial activities.  Although a reasonable amount is known             about how aromatics are degraded by bacteria, not much is known                 about how bacteria detect the presence of aromatic compounds in the             environment. Several genera of motile bacteria, including                       Pseudomonas, have a strong behavioral attraction to aromatic                    compounds.  This project will study the mechanistic basis for                   chemotaxis to the aromatic acid, benzoate, by Pseudomonas putida.               Our intent is to understand how the receptor that detects these                 aromatic acids functions and to elucidate the relationship between              attractant recognition and biodegradation.  Genetic and biochemical             experiments are planned to identify the genes necessary for                     specific behavioral responses to benzoate, and to express and                   characterize the proteins encoded by these genes.  The regulation               of the chemotaxis genes and of selected benzoate degradation genes              will also be analyzed, with a particular focus on defining DNA                  sequences and regulatory proteins that are required for gene                    expression.  Since chemotaxis is an important prelude to                        metabolism, the proposed work could lead to the development of                  improved strategies for the biodegradation of selected toxic                    compounds.  The receptor protein for benzoate may also have                     distinctive structural characteristics.",
