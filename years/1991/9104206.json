 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Xenopus oocyte/mRNA injection system has provided a critical                key to the characterization and cloning of cDNAs for various animal             neurotransmitter receptors.  Dr. Sutton proposes that this system               can be used in an analogous manner for the study of plant hormone               (phytohormone) receptors.  The specific aim of this proposal is to              test the hypothesis that plant mRNA injected into Xenopus oocytes               will result in the synthesis and incorporation of phytohormone                  receptors into the Xenopus oocyte plasma membrane, and that these               receptors will couple to the Xenopus oocyte second messenger                    systems.  RNA will be isolated from the barley aleurone layer which             is known to be responsive to various phytohormones.  The RNA will               be injected into Xenopus oocytes and the oocytes allowed to                     incubate for 3-5 days.  The successful synthesis and incorporation              of the receptors into the oocyte membrane will be tested by                     monitoring for phytohormone-induced chloride currents in the                    membrane of the oocytes by the two-electrode voltage clamp                      technique and by radio-labelled hormone binding studies.                                                                                                        If this approach is successful, the results of this research will               facilitate the cloning and characterization of plant hormone                    receptors which have proven elusive to more traditional biochemical             approaches.  The expression or lack of expression of plant hormone              receptors in this animal cell system should also provide                        significant information about protein sorting to the plasma                     membrane.",
