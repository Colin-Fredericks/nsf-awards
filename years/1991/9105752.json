 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among other mechanisms that have been proposed to control microbial             cell division cycles, autonomous biological oscillators provide a               possible means of integrating the disparate concepts of cell cycle,             exit, and transit.  The proposed research will be concerned with                the means by which this coupling between oscillator and cell                    division cycle is effected.  Cyclic AMP, which exhibits bimodal                 circadian rhythmicity in the algal flagellate Euglena gracilis, and             which is known to have the capacity to control certain rate-                    limiting steps in the progression of the cell division cycle in                 many cell types, may play such a coupling role, participating in                the gating of cell division cycle events to specific phases of the              circadian cycle.  Two problems will be addressed:  First, how the               clock confers rhythmicity upon the adenyl cyclase/cAMP-                         phosphodiesterase system, and second, how the adenyl cyclase/cAMP-              phosphodiesterase interacts with and modulates the cell division                cycle.  The regulation of the level and rhythmicity of cAMP by                  adenyl cyclase, phosphodiesterase, and other second messengers                  (such as cGMP and calcium) will be studied in synchronously                     dividing and nondividing cultures of the achlorophyllous ZC mutant              of Euglena, maintained in constant darkness, by examining the                   ability of pulses of various drugs and chemicals that are known to              activate or inhibit these biochemical species to phase-shift the                rhythms of cAMP level, adenyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase                     activities, and cell division.  The cellular receptor for cAMP,                 which preliminary results suggest is a cAMP-dependent kinase, will              be characterized, and a correlation between kinase stimulation and              effects of cAMP or cAMP analogs on the cell division cycle will be              sought.  Finally, a Euglena homolog of p34 (the cdc 2 protein-                  kinase gene product of fission yeast) will be sought, and if it is              identified, its histone H1 kinase activity will be measured at                  different phases of the cell division cycle in synchronous cultures             perturbed by a cAMP pulse.                                                                                                                                      Circadian rhythms have been documented in organisms ranging from                unicellular eukaryotes to higher plants and animals and concern                 activities as varied as leaf movements in plants, locomotor                     activity in insects and mammals, and photosynthesis in unicellular              algae.  The cell division cycle of many algae, fungi, and protozoa              also exhibit circadian rhythms; cell division occurs only during                restricted intervals of the circadian cycle, often at the times                 corresponding to the dark intervals in a diurnal light-dark cycle.              This phenomenon is thought to reflect an interaction between the                circadian clock and the cell cycle oscillator.  The long range goal             of this research is to determine the nature of the circadian                    clock(s) presumed to couple to the cell division cycle and to                   generate periodicity of division, as well as to underlie circadian              rhythmicity in general.",
