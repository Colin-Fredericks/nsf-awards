 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop is proposed to investigate the potential application of              visual database systems to research in marine biology.  Visual                  database systems link relational databases with extensive video or              image libraries.  Such systems can be used to construct a generic               resource of combined factual and visual information about marine                organisms and about their environments.  Such a resource could                  support a range of research, environmental assessment, and                      educational applications in the marine sciences.                                                                                                                At this time there is a logistics crisis in the management of                   visual information relating to taxonomic work needed to support                 marine research.  Much visual information has already been                      collected, but is essentially inaccessible.  The amount collected               by various automated and remotely operated vehicles is increasing.              Furthermore, it is getting increasingly difficult to process                    existing and new collected material.                                                                                                                            Prototypes have shown the technical capabilities of visual database             systems meet perceived needs in the marine sciences.  A window of               opportunity currently exists to use visual database systems to deal             with the above problems.  Decisions have to be made about the                   visual database system features which will result in the \"best                  conomically possible format\" allowing transfer of information                   between user sites, about the priorities of development, and the                logistics of continued maintenance.                                                                                                                             Input from potential users of such systems will allow development               of a comprehensive resource and workstation delivery environment                to be guided by immediate and future application criteria.",
