 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of two parts.  The first is a theoretical and             empirical investigation of the role of endogenous debt constraints              in determining consumption, and the impact of such constraints on               asset market pricing.  The second part is a theoretical                         investigation of learning in games.  There is a loose connection                between the two parts in the sense that learning is potentially an              important explanation for such asset market phenomena as                        speculative bubbles.                                                                                                                                            This research is very significant because it bridges two very                   different literatures on credit markets: the incomplete markets                 literature and contract theory.  The synthesis of these two                     literatures produces models that capture both approaches as special             cases.  The preliminary theoretical and empirical results give                  different efficiency and policy implications than the more                      traditional approaches.",
