 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been growing interest in non-equilibrium phase                        transitions, yet our understanding of them is far from complete.                The proposed research will explore transitions far from equilibrium             in several specific systems: fluid invasion, magnetic domain wall               motion, fluid spreading, friction, and shearing of solids and                   fluids.  In addition to allowing insight into basic features of                 non-equilibrium transitions, the work will address systems of                   technological importance.  The first three processes are                        prototypical examples of interface motion through disordered media.             Disorder impedes interface motion and a finite force is needed to               initiate flow.  Two types of critical phenomena have been                       identified at the onset of motion: depinning and percolation.  One              goal of the research will be a complete characterization of these               transitions for specific models.  The variation of the depinning                force, the critical exponents, and the interface morphology with                the spatial dimension and nature and strength of the disorder will              be explored.  Phase transitions between different universality                  classes will also be studied.  Studies of friction and sheared                  systems will explore the role of internal degrees of freedom in                 producing discontinuous phase transitions.  One focus will be the               shear-induced melting transition in colloidal suspensions.  This                work will also provide information about flow of solids under high              shear stresses.  A second focus will be stick-slip friction -                   alternate sticking and sliding between two surfaces.  Stick-slip                motion leads to squeaks in hinges and to wear of moving parts.  The             proposed research will extend recent studies which indicate that                stick-slip friction is caused by periodic non-equilibrium phase                 transitions.",
