 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of eight U.S.                         scientists in a joint seminar on \"Fundamentals of Bath                          Smelting and Clean Steel Production,\" to be held in North                       Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in October 1991.  The meeting                      will focus on fundamental research on methods of developing                     new ironmaking technologies that use coal directly and                          processes to prodice high quality \"clean\" steels.  The                          co-organizers are Professor Richard J. Fruehan and Alan W.                      Cramb, Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Materials                    Science, Carnegie Mellon University and Professor Nobuo Sano,                   Department of Metallurgy, University of Tokyo.  This is the                     third joint seminar in the general area of steelmaking, with                    the others being held in 1976 and 1983.                                                                                                                         Technically advanced countries, such as the United States and                   Japan, must develop new iron and steelmaking processes that                     are economical, pose fewer environmental problems, and produce                  high quality steels for national and international markets.                     Both countries are developing such processes to produce high                    quality or ultra clean steel.  Such steels are required for                     new steel products and improved current products, such as                       those for automotive applications.  It is in higher quality                     steels that the United States and Japan have some advantage                     over lower cost producing nations and must maintain their                       advantage.  In the process of bath smelting there are many                      fundamental generic problems.  Whereas much of the practical                    know how for the process is confidential in nature, the                         generic fundamental research is not.  Examples of fundamental                   research include slag foaming, reduction reactions, and                         solution of ore and coal.  The joint seminar will provide a                     unique forum for discussing this research which will, in the                    long term, benefit each country's efforts to develop a new                      process.",
