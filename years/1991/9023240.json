 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emulsion polymerization is one of the most important                       commercial processes for converting unsaturated monomers into                   synthetic polymers.  Billions of pounds of latex are produced                   annually for a broad range of applications such as: surface                     coatings, synthetic elastomers, adhesions, binders for non-                     woven materials, high-impact plastics, additives for                            construction materials and fluid property modifiers.  Small                     volumes of latex products are also used in biomedical and                       scientific applications.                                                             Conventional emulsion polymerization involves the                          dispersion of a hydrophobic monomer, or monomers, into water                    with an oil-in-water emulsifier, followed by polymerization                     with a water-soluble initiator.  Although the droplets in the                   monomer emulsion are usually 2 to 10 \u001am, the diameters of the                   polymer particles in the final product are almost always in                     the submicron range.  Hence, the reaction includes particle                     nucleation rather than simply polymerization in the monomer                     droplets.  These systems exhibit characteristically high                        reaction rates and a high degree of polymerization.  The                        product is comprised of colloidal polymer particles in a                        stable suspense, referred to as a latex dispersed in the                        aqueous phase.                                                                       Dispersion polymerization is a process in which the                        continuous phase us a solvent for the monomers but not the                      resulting polymer formed is generally stabilized by block or                    graft copolymers.  Resultant polymer particle size is many                      microns in diameter-the lower end of the suspension                             polymerization range.                                                                This research  is aimed at obtaining a better knowledge                    of the reactions in the separate phases in heterogenous free                    radical polymerization systems.  The main thrust is to examine                  the impact of reactions in the continuous phase when monomers                   with different solubilities are polymerized and when polymeric                  stabilizers are used with conventional monomers.  Work in                       emulsion and dispersion polymerization will be done.                                 The research will consist of both experimental and                         theoretical work.  The experimental work will involve                           measurement of reaction rates, reagent concentrations,                          particle size distributions, copolymer compositional                            parameters and molecular weights.  Model simulations will be                    used to evaluate the data and to extrapolate to new operating                   conditions.  The results will be used to help custom design                     new molecules and products for specific high-value                              applications.  The increased understanding of continuous-phase                  phenomena will also lead to improvements in existing products                   and processes.***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    //",
