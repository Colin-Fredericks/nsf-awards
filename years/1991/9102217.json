 "awd_abstract_narration": "In previous work, Dr. Heck and collaborators assessed the                  importance of short-term grazing by sea urchins, and bioturbation               by sand dollars in a seagrass habitat in the northern Gulf.                     Based on results of this effort and newly published information,                they will now initiate additional field experiments in the                      northern Gulf of Mexico, as well as studies at a south Florida                  site, to identify more precisely the densities of sea urchins and               the duration of herbivory required to permanently create                        unvegetated sand flats.  Together these two sites represents the                northern and southern extents of some of the most extensive                     seagrass habitats in the United States, encompassing some 14,000                Km2.  Additionally, they will continue assessing the role of                    bioturbation of the seagrass rhizosphere by sand dollars, and the               potential interaction between sand dollar bioturbation and sea                  urchin herbivory in limiting the distribution of seagrass                       habitats.  They will carry out the first experimental                           examination of the ability of stringrays and burrowing crabs to                 create and maintain unvegetated sand flats within otherwise                     suitable habitat for seagrasses.                                                     The work will improve our understanding of the variables                   involved in maintaining habitat and mosaics, and those that                     facilitate changes between alternative community states (e.g.                   seagrass meadows and sand flats) which in turn can lead to                      drastic shifts in primary and secondary productivity.",
