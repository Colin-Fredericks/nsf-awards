 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a program of research                                   which builds upon work done while the principal                                 investigator was a postdoctoral member of the                                   technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories.  In                                  previous studies it was demonstrated that within the                            ballistic mean free path, electrons in two-                                     dimensional electron systems can be controlled in a                             manner similar to the manipulation of photons in                                optical systems.  This field of research can aptly be                           labeled ballistic electron optics.  The low                                     temperature electronic mobilities in the devices of                             the previous studies were extremely high (>                                     5x106cm2/Vs), corresponding to elastic mean free                                paths of many tens of micrometers.  This enabled                                the manipulation of ballistic carriers over relatively                          long distances (>10um).  Since the characteristic                               electron wavelength is typically two orders of                                  magnitude smaller than this, the wave nature of the                             electrons did not play an important role, and                                   analogies with geometrical optics have been made.                               In order to further this field of research and to                               investigate whether ballistic electron optical devices                          have the potential for the creation of new types of                             switching systems and computer architectures, the                               present research is focused on the following areas:                             1) the investigation of how these devices can be                                scaled down in size and what role the wave nature                               of the electrons will play, 2) integrating two or                               more devices together, and 3) the development of                                new ballistic electron devices.  The equipment                                  necessary to carry out this research (3He cryostat                              with 11 Tesla magnet, and photolithography and                                  electron beam lithography facilities) are available                             within the Center For Solid State Electronics                                   Research of which the principle investigator is a                               member.",
