 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective in this project is to develop a method which                 will permit the production of adherent, abrasion-resistant                      coating of Indium-Two Oxide (ITO) on plastic substrates.  It is                 proposed that the desired goal be attained by use of a gradient                 sublayer which gradually spans the gap in chemical and physical                 properties between Indium-Two Oxide (ITO) and the organic                       substrate.  This gradient compositional sublayer will be                        deposited using radio frequency (RF) plasma polymerization and                  plasma sputtering techniques.  The proposed work is predicted on                the equipment availability and recent experiences with plasma                   polymerization studies in our laboratories as well as recent                    literature results demonstrating the surface metallization of                   plastic substrates using radio frequency (RF) plasma techniques.                The gradient sublayers employed will be ones which change                       gradually from 100% organic character to a metal oxide (e.g.,                   aluminum oxide A12O3) or non-metal oxide (e.g., silium dioxide                  SiO2) outer surface to which the Indium-Two Oxide (ITO) will be                 bonded.  Preliminary studies in our laboratory using conventional               sublayer coating techniques are sufficiently promising to                       demonstrate the overall feasibility of the proposed research.                        The development of a strongly adhesive, abrasion resistance                coating of Indium-Two Oxide (ITO) on plastic will open the door                 to a variety of promising commercial possibilities.  Most                       important of these would be the production of all-plastic liquid-               crystal displays (LCDs) as well as new inexpensive plastics-based               keyboards.",
