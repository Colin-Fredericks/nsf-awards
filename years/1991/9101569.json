 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor James Liggett of Cornell                      University in a research collaboration with Professor Gustavo                   Ayala of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).                    The objective of their research is to study leaks in water                      distribution systems by directing a measurement program so                      that leaks can be detected with minimum effort.  Such a program                 can be automated and the analysis made continuously to find                     anomalies in the system.                                                                                                                                        Leaks in water distribution systems are a common occurrence,                    whether they are caused by a catastrophic event such as an                      earthquake or by slow deterioration.  Detection of such leaks                   is a major problem.  As a result of the 1985 earthquake,                        Mexican officials have expressed a willingness to collect                       additional data as required for relevant research on the Mexico                 City water distribution system and to carry on experiments in                   small portions of the distribution system.  The Mexican side                    will also provide software that is useful for computation in                    water distribution systems while the U.S. side will address                     parameter identification types of calculations.   As                            envisioned, this collaborative research cooperation offers a                    golden opportunity to test algorithms with real data under                      realistic situations and, consequently, has the potential to                    develop effective procedures for leak detection and damage                      control.",
