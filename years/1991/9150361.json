 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galveston College is modernizing its freshman/sophomore physics                 laboratory with microcomputers, interface equipment,                            measurement probes, printers and data acquisition and analysis                  software.  New laboratory instructions are being developed and                  written to incorporate the microcomputer instrumentation with                   the current laboratory apparatus.  This includes measuring                      procedures and computer analysis techniques to guide the                        student to a better understanding of physics principles.  The                   use of a spreadsheet is being emphasized for data analysis in                   many of the experiments.  The spreadsheet serves as a tool for                  students to select and manipulate collected data, produce                       graphs and make theoretical comparisons.  The computer system                   expedites data collection, calculations and graphing, providing                 more time for the student to analyze and comprehend the physics                 principles involved.  The power of the computer system allows                   for more in-depth analysis and for new types of experiments.                    Careful consideration is given to the writing of the laboratory                 instructions so as not to overwhelm the student with the                        computer operations.",
