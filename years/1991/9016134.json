 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a joint US-France seminar on the                        topic of \"Adsorption Processes for Gas Separation\". The                         organizers of the seminar are:  Dr. Douglas Levan, Department                   of Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia, and Dr. F.                     Meunier, Laboratoire d'Informatique pour la Mecanique et les                    Sciences de l'Ingenieur, Orsay, France.                                                                                                                         Adsorption processes are important in several applications                      for gas separation. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) has many                    small and large scale applications, including air separation,                   carbon-dioxide/methane separation, hydrogen production,                         hydrocarbon separation and gas drying.  PSA is also expected                    to play an increasing role in anti-pollution projects, such as                  the recovery of pollutants from industrial effluents.                           Research on PSA and the development of PSA is very active in                    both the US and France. The laboratories of the French                          National Center for Scientific Research are strongly involved                   in the field of adsorptive gas separation and French industry                   is present in the whole chain of scientific and engineering                     functions (adsorbent preparation, process design and process                    operation). The joint workshop will bring together experts                      for an intensive four day workshop on gas separation by                         adsorption with specific focus on the most recent trends in                     PSA research and processes. Topics to be discussed are:  1)                     the materials aspect of adsorbent design  2) methods for the                    prediction of mass transfer rates of mixtures in adsorbents,                    3) the exact role of modeling and numerical simulation in the                   conception of new processes, and 4) the reliability of                          predictive models.  The results of this workshop should make                    a valuable contribution to future directions in adsorption                      process research.",
