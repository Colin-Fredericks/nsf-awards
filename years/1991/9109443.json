 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research examines the determinants of public school                teacher salaries in the state of California.  During the planning               period, the study estimates the relationships between wages and                 characteristics of the teachers, school districts, students, and                parents.  Lifetime wage profiles are evaluated with reference to                human capital, agency, and median voter theories.  The study tests              three hypotheses on union behavior: whether unions decrease the                 dispersion of wages, whether unions increase labor's share of total             costs, and whether unions increase the share of compensation                    allocated to fringe benefits.  The research also investigates the               adequacy of conventional empirical approaches to wage determination             in markets characterized by explicit contracts.                                                                                                                 This research will both increase our understanding of salary                    variation under explicit contracts and serve as the basis for a                 behavioral model of wage and employment determination in a                      unionized market.  Such a model will let policy makers predict the              union and school district responses to changes in the district's                exogenous budget constraint and calculate the effects of an                     increase in state educational expenditures on teacher salaries and              class size.",
