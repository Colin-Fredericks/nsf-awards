 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs are geologically ancient ecosystems that have                       provided excellent historical evidence of global climatic changes               and some of the best indications extant of ecosystem response to                such changes.  Yet coral reefs are believed by some to be                       indicators of global climate change in more than just the                       historical sense.  There has been considerable recent speculation               in the press, discussion among reef researchers,  and testimony                 on the topic of coral \"bleaching,\" a phenomenon that some                       interpret as a stress reaction of reef corals to elevated sea                   surface temperature (SST's) caused by global climate change.                    This interpretation has been met with considerable skepticism                   from many in the scientific community, yet it has nonetheless                   captured considerable attention in the press and in Congress.                   Coral bleaching is a possible present indicator of climate                      change.  This workshop will meet a critical need to assess the                  state of our knowledge about coral bleaching and, in the larger                 sense, to determine research needs for the next decade for                      understanding the effects of potential global climate change on                 shallow water tropical marine ecosystems such as coral reefs.",
