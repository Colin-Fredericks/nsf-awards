 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooperative research in several areas of computer-                              intensive statistics will be undertaken with partial                            support from this award by Dr. Arthur Owen of Stanford                          University and Dr. Peter Hall of the Australian                                 National University.  One area involves comparing the                           efficiency of using bootstrap and other nonparametric                           inference statistical methods to that of using analytic                         techniques in areas such as genetics.  In addition,                             computational issues in complicated statistics will be                          studied as they apply to determining parameters in                              multiple regression models.                                                                                                                                     The project represents excellent collaboration between                          Australian and U.S. researchers with complementary                              expertise in the area of computer-intensive statistical                         methods.  U.S. researchers will have access to                                  Dr. Hall's group, as well as similar centers of                                 excellence at Bond University and the University of New                         South Wales.  New algorithms and better theoretical                             understanding of these statistical methods are expected                         to result from the project, as well as potential                                applications of these improved techniques to genetics                           and other areas requiring regression models.",
