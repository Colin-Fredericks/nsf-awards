 "awd_abstract_narration": "The post-peak response of soils governs the behavior of soil                    masses subjected to moderate to high levels of strain; this                     occurs during earthquake-induced flow failures, such as slope                   instabilities or bearing capacity failure.  Examples of                         earthquake-induced flow failures are the failure of the Lower                   San Fernando dam in 1971, failure of tailings dams in Chile                     in 1965 and 1985, and the bearing capacity failures in                          Niigata, Japan, in 1964.                                                                                                                                        The objective of this research program is to provide                            experimental evidence of the nature of the post-peak                            response of soils and to cast these results into a manageable                   theoretical framework.  The concept of an undrained steady-                     state strength as a limiting shearing resistance for a soil                     undergoing steady-state deformations provides a framework                       for evaluating liquefaction and flow slide potential.  It is                    imperative that uniform strains develop in laboratory tests                     used to define this relationship; thus the uniformity of                        deformation is being examined experimentally by shearing                        specimens of saturated sands in both servo-controlled,                          heavily-instrumented plane strain compression and a                             standard triaxial device.",
