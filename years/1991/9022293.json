 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge engineering is concerned with the development of                      qualitative computer models of processes, and procedures for                    applying these models to practical problems of diagnosis, design,               control, etc. of complex systems.  Knowledge acquisition research               focuses on the development of computer tool for facilitating this               modeling process, especially the accumulation of general                        representations and reasoning procedures that can be used for                   many problems.  This work studies the foundational issues of                    formalization and human cognition that lie behind reuse of                      representation in new settings for new purposes.  Situated                      cognition research suggests that people have capabilities for                   creating new representations that today's computers lack;                       furthermore, the meaning of a representation and the context that               justifies it are always open to reinterpretation and can never be               captured fully by representations.  To deal with this, the work                 will represent the assumptions that justify changes to a model,                 so a knowledge acquisition program, but especially knowledge                    engineers themselves, will be able to intelligently reconstruct                 the origin and meaning of past representations, and hence more                  readily adapt them to new contexts.  The main idea is to study                  how people use a layered history of cases, representations, and                 annotations to reinterpret and re-represent their past work as                  they discover and argue for changes to an evolving model.  The                  result is improved failure-analysis techniques, coupled with a                  better understanding of what aspects of the knowledge engineering               process cannot be automatized using current methods, but which                  appropriate tools can nevertheless facilitate.",
