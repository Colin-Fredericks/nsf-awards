 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematical theory of weak convergence has been shown                 to have important applications to problems arising in continuum                 physics because it describes the relations between microscopic                  variables and their averages at a macroscopic level.  In order to               average nonlinear quantities, a mathematical tool called                        compensated compactness has been developed by F. Murat and the                  principal investigator and it has been used to obtain various                   relations of a macroscopic nature from corresponding microscopic                relations.  An improvement of this tool, based on so called H-                  measures that first appeared in questions of homogenization, has                been developed recently by the principal investigator.                               The goal of this project is to further study the                           mathematical properties of H-measures, enlarge the class of its                 applications to nonlinear partial differential equations of                     continuum mechanics, and define more general mathematical objects               that could remedy some of the already known limitations of H-                   measures.                                                                            Particular areas to be studied include effective properties                of mixtures, nonlocal effects induced by homogenization,                        evolution of microstructures in composite materials and damping                 of waves in heterogeneous materials.",
