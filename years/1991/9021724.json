 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of New Mexico for the renovation, repair, and                        replacement of a portion of Castetter Hall which houses the                     majority of that institution's biological research and research                 training activities.  This building was constructed in two phases,              one in 1951 and one in 1969.  While scattered laboratories within               the building have been renovated, the area described has never been             renovated.  The ARFMP grant of $150,000 and $150,000 provided by                the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these                     research and research training facilities which will enhance the                Biology Department's existing strength in ecology and evolutionary              biology, promote its growing strength in cell and molecular                     biology, and encourage interactions among disciplines.  This                    project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure by replacing the greenhouse with a modern                        temperature and humidity controlled facility, by replacing the                  growth chambers, and by appropriately configuring research                      laboratory space and equipping it with upgraded ventilation,                    plumbing, and electrical systems.                                                                                                                               This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for a more balanced program of                biological research and for the training of quality undergraduate               and graduate students in a minority institution.  This project                  will enhance the importance for the region and for the nation of                the University of New Mexico's program in biology.",
