 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed work is to further our understanding of              the differences between the immune responses of previously-                     immunized (secondary) and naive (primary) animals to T-dependent                antigens.  The system to be used is the response to the hapten,                 fluorescein, and both B cell and Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL)                   responses will be studied.  It is hypothesized that, since the                  eventual effector phase of the B cell immune response involves an               antibody molecule, whereas the end-stage of the CTL response                    resides in a cell-cell mediated interaction, the modes of                       maximizing the effectiveness of the two types of secondary immune               responses may differ.  The work to be carried out includes an                   analysis of the molecular basis of memory in the IgM response to                fluorescein.  These experiments are prompted by the observation of              an apparent dichotomy of V region gene use in the primary and                   secondary IgM responses to fluorescein.  Investigations of the CTL              anti-fluorescein response will include limiting dilution analyses               of primary and secondary CTLs, immunofluorescent studies of the                 density and arrangement of a variety of molecules on the surface                of CD8-positive T cells, and an genetic study of the T cell                     receptor molecules used in primary and secondary CTL responses.                                                                                                 There is a great need for such an in-depth analysis, which is                   expected to lead to an understanding of differences between primary             and secondary immune responses.  The CTL projects, in particular,               are likely to yield fundamental advances in the field.  In                      addition, since the work will be carried out in a predominantly                 undergraduate setting, with student collaborators-in-training, the              projects will have enormous impact in terms of its contribution to              science education at the undergraduate level.",
