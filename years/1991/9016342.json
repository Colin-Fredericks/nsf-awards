 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in geophysics                    between Dr. Harry Green, University of California, Davis, and                   Professor J.C. Doukhan, Laboratoire de Structure et Proprietes                  de l'Etat Solide, University of Lille-Flandres-Artois,                          France.  The objectives of the project are to investigate the                   rheology and deformation mechanisms of materials with                           perovskite, ilmenite and garnet structures at high pressure                     and temperature and to study applications to flow in the                        Earth's mantle.                                                                                                                                                 The Earth is slowly cooling by convection in its interior.                      Earthquakes, volcanoes and continental drift are all                            consequences of this slow convective flow in the rocks of the                   mantle. Considerable experimental work has been performed on                    the mechanisms of solid-state flow in the upper mantle over                     the last twenty years, but the type of apparatus capable of                     controlled deformation and stress measurement at pressures                      equivalent to greater depths does not exist.  Recent results                    in Dr. Green's laboratory strongly support the use of                           structural analogues of deep mantle phases to advance the                       understanding of deep mantle flow.  In this project, the                        investigators propose a collaborative effort to determine the                   rheology and flow mechanisms of perovskite, ilmenite and                        garnet structures at high pressure and temperature.  The                        results of this study will contribute greatly to models of                      deep-mantle and/or whole-mantle convection and will allow                       semi-quantitative assessment of the current controversy over                    whether or not the lower mantle is significantly more                           viscous than the upper mantle.  Experiments will be conducted                   in the US with unique high pressure deformation equipment.                      Analysis by transmission electron microscopy will be carried                    out in France.  The project will benefit from the expertise                     of the US investigator in the rheology of geological materials                  and the extensive experience of Dr. Doukhan in transmission                     electron microscopy of the deformation microstructure of                        complicated ceramic and mineral crystal structures.",
