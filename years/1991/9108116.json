 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this US-Bulgaria research                              project between Dr. Alexander Meyerovich of the University                      of Rhode Island and Dr. Klara Ivanova of the Institute                          for Solid State Physics, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences,                         is to study boundary phenomena.  This project focuses on                        the physics of spin-polarized quantum systems to                                research slip effects and transverse or longitudinal                            spin relaxation at the walls in the presence of absorbed                        boundary layers.  Researchers plan to generalize from the                       existing theory of slip effects in order to incorporate                         spin-polarized quantum systems, to analyze new effects                          and to accomplish the technical aspects by the calculation                      of different slip coefficient for quantum systems.  They                        will use spin-polarized Fermi liquids and quantum gases                         to determine the length, derive proper Onsager relations                        and calculate the values of slip coefficients, and to                           apply to longitudinal spin diffusion in spin-polarized                          quantum systems.   The results of this project in the                           physics of spin-polarized quantum systems are expected                          to lead to noticeable corrections for stationary values                         of several thermo- and hydrodynamic characteristics such                        as temperature or magnetization and result in the                               reanalyzing of well-established experimental results.                           The information resulting from this project is likely to                        be applicable to the study of any multicomponent                                mixtures of quantum liquids or cases.                                                                                                                           This project in materials theory fulfills the program                           objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe                         to combine complementary talents and pool research                              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                                competence.",
