 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate algorithms to build reliable shared              memory systems on distributed memory architectures.  Reliability is             crucial when the number of components increases in such architectures           and the large amount of work performed by a typical computation can             ill-afford to be lost in a failure.  The research is divided into two           stages.  The first stage is design of a collection of such algorithms.          The second stage is to evaluate the algorithms using simulations,               analytic models, and actual implementations.  The collection of                 algorithms will address the tradeoff between recovery cost and the              overhead during normal execution.  They also distinguish between two            different models on shared memory:  one in which the entire process             address space is shared, and the other in which application-defined             segments of memory are shared.                                                  Performance evaluation is a crucial component of this research, since           recovery and overhead cost are closely related to the pattern of                communication in an actual shared memory system.  Address traces from           real application programs are used to simulate performance of the               reliability algorithms.  Analytic models are used to extend the                 results beyond these applications.  Finally, implementations of                 algorithms provide actual performance figures and verification of the           analysis and simulation.                                                        The algorithms borrow techniques from reliability research on message           passing systems.  The availability of shared memory applications,               however, allows an estimation of the overhead of reliability                    algorithms and a realistic comparison of these algorithms.",
