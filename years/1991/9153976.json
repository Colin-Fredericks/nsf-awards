 "awd_abstract_narration": "Children's Television Workshop is embaring on a ground-                    breaking experiment in informal science education: the                          production of an entertaining animated series of 13 half-                       hour programs for Saturday morning commercial television,                       based on David Macaulay's bestselling book, The Way Things                      Work.  The audience will be six- to eleven-year olds, with                      special focus on minority and economically disadvantaged                        children.  The series' primary goal will be to entertain                        children with lively and appealing characters in a dramatic                     storyline, while stimulating children's interest in the                         scientific principles behind the workings of familiar                           machines and illustrating the action of their parts.  NSF                       support will enable CTW to adapt the CTW Model -- the                           collaborative process used in earlier NSF-supported                             programs, 3-2-1 Contact and Square One Tv -- to the                             opportunities of the animation format and the realities of                      the partnership with a commercial network.                                                                                                                           Through a development agreement with CBS, CTW has begun                    the process of developing the series concept, characters,                       and storylines.  Upon successful completion of this phase,                      production will follow with an anticipated broadcast                            premiere in fall 1992.  NSF's $2.36 million support will                        allow this project to be possible by completing the series'                     funding; it will allow CTW to conduct significant formative                     research and summative analyses of educational impact, and                      to reach large minority and economically disadvantaged                          audiences through wider promotion and the creation and                          distribution of complementary print materials.",
