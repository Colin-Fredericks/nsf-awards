 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will investigate biochemical mechanisms related to                 induction of a cytochrome P450 enzyme in the cockroach fat body by              the hypertrehalosemic neurohormone (HTH) is an insect protein                   hormone secreted by nerve cells that stimulates the fat body                    (=insect \"liver\") to convert carbohydrate stores to blood sugar                 (trehalose).  HTH also stimulates expression of a gene for a new                member in a family of P450 enzymes traceable in evolution history               to the time of divergence of bacteria and higher organisms.  The                significance of HTH-dependent P450 will be assessed as it relates               to fat body metabolism, and the P450 gene will be isolated and                  structurally characterized to identify how HTH controls its                     expression.  Cockroaches are one of the oldest living organisms,                and since this P450 is one of the oldest genes, studies on HTH                  regulation of P450 gene expression in cockroach fat body will                   illuminate a fundamental cellular regulatory process that dates to              the time of the origin of higher animals.  From a practical view,               P450's are the means by which all animals, including  man,                      metabolize foreign chemicals such as drugs, toxins, carcinogens and             insecticides.  Since many of these compounds are neurotoxic, they               may stimulate neuroendocrine cells to release hormones which induce             P450 synthesis for metabolism of the toxicant.  Therefore, studies              linking neurohormones with P450 synthesis may provide a fundamental             explanation for both man's response to carcinogens and insect                   resistance to insecticides.//",
