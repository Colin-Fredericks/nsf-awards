 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Congresses of Mathematical Education are                      the most important forums for exchanges of scientific                           information among scholars in mathematics education.  The                       Seventh ICME will be held on August 17-23, 1992 in Quebec                       City, Quebec, Canada.  Given the current reform efforts in                      mathemaics education and the emerging and expanding dialogue                    among international scholars in mathematics education on                        curriculum, teacher education, and student expectations, it                     is essential that the United States be well represented by                      key mathematics educators and that information from the                         Congress be widely disseminated among the nation's                              mathematics educators and educational leaders.  The National                    Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), with the support                     of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), proposes                      to select 40 delegates to ICME-7and provide them with a                         participation award to subsidize their costs in attending.                      In return, each awardee will provide a written summary of                       Congress sessions they attended.  These reports, along with                     those of the Awards Committee and invited papers by selected                    individuals, will serve as the basis for a monograph on                         Congress Activities that will be published by                                   the NCTM.  Articles will be prepared by the Awards Committee                    for NCTM and MAA newsletters (circulation over 100,000).                        Presentations will also be made at regional and national                        meetings of both organizations.  Additionally, materials on                     the reform efforts in the United States will be shared with                     others at the Congress.",
