 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical instruments for performing linewidth                                    measurement or for finding the geometry of small                                features are limited by the resolution associated with                          the wavelength of light.  Basic optical theory states                           that features smaller than one-half of the illumination                         wavelength are unresolvable.  However, information                              is present in the image about higher spatial                                    frequencies than given by the optical resolution.  By                           measuring phase rather than intensity, 0.3 to 0.5 um                            features can be measured with an interferometric                                optical microscope.  Information about higher spatial                           frequencies may be extracted by applying image                                  processing techniques such as simulated annealing,                              linear and nonlinear least-squares estimation, and the                          Gerchberg algorithm.  The aim of this research is to                            apply these techniques in an interferometric optical                            profiler to extend the range of submicron linewidth                             measurements down to 0.1 um.  An applicable                                     technique would be useful in a commercial product.                              Possible applications include the measurement of                                integrated circuit or integrated optical device                                 geometries as well as measurement of pits in compact                            disk masters, and magnetic recording head geometry.",
