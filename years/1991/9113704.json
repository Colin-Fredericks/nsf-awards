 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current research has established the validity of the                       approach to automated fixture design whereby knowledge for a                    single operation is represented in an expert system.  The                       objective of the research is to extend the knowledge to incorporate             a more realistic scenario, namely, fixturing for a                              sequence of operations. The internship is based on established work             by the principal investigator in automated design of fixtures                   (AutoFix).  It plans to redesign the system to carry out fixturing              for a finite sequence of operations.  The work will commence with               knowledge acquisition from practitioners in industry.  A system                 structure to handle multiple-optioned sets of heuristics (strategy,             meta, and knowledge rules) will be developed.  Knowledge on design              of fixtures for multiple operations will be represented in a                    rule/frame structure.  An existing computer-aided design (CAD)                  system interface will be incorporated.                                               In automated design, this work will present a method of                    representing and handling complex design knowledge.  This method                may then be extended to other systems for mechanical design.  The               contribution to manufacturing research is more significant as                   this will greatly reduce fixture design and machine set-up times.               It will lay the foundation for future research in this field of                 fixturing for a flexible manufacturing environment.",
