 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colorado State University seeks funding for a three-year                        project:  Discrete Mathematics Instruction in a Cooperative                     Problem Solving Mode.  The idea for the development of the                      project is the recommendation that Discrete Mathematics                         become a part of the secondary school curriculum, as                            outlined in the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for                         School Mathematics for the National Council of Teachers of                      Mathematics.  The PI proposes through this project to                           develop and implement a course sequence in discrete                             mathematics required of secondary mathematics preservice                        teachers.  The course will be team-taught in a cooperative                      learning/problem solving mode by mathematics faculty                            members who will have received special instruction, and two                     graduate students who have extensive teaching experience as                     former high school teachers.  The project will also                             emphasize writing in mathematics and model alternative                          instructional formats.  The preservice students will take                       the course with a required lab in which:  they will be                          studying about the teaching and learning of mathematics in                      these modes; they will be assistants in the teaching of a                       freshman course in discrete mathematics taught by the same                      faculty team; and cooperatively they will develop                               instructional modules to be use in the elementary course                        which can also be used in high school classes with minor                        modifications.  Thus, the preservice teachers will gain                         knowledge and experience in discrete mathematics, in                            cooperative learning, in complex problem solving                                strategies, and in writing in the mathematics discipline                        both as teachers and learners.  Inservice teachers will be                      invited to take the courses and to produce projects for                         their own classes.  The training components for faculty                         will also be open to area teachers.                                                                                                                             The project is one which can be easily replicated and                           disseminated and has the potential to become a model for                        content and instruction not only for the preparation of                         teachers, but for the teaching of mathematics for all                           students at the collegiate level using alternative formats                      of instruction.                                                                                                                                                 Colorado State University is supporting the project by                          providing 40% of the total cost.",
