 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project involves the design, development and                       experimental demonstration of a model that integrates time with                 object databases.  Preliminary evidence suggests that existing                  notions of temporal data must be modified because of the                        transition from the relational to the object model. As such, this               model is the first step towards the synthesis of an integrated                  object model that supports the temporal aspects of data modeling                in addition to the structural and dynamic ones.  Investigations                 to be undertaken include: (a) the study of the semantics of time                and the development of a set of temporal principles to be used as               an underlying basis for the design of our temporal object model;                (b) the study of the temporal aspects of objects and the                        development of a model for integrating time with objects and the                formalization of the model; (c) the augmentation of the data                    modeling power of object and semantic modeling concepts,                        particularly versions, with temporal modeling concepts; (d) the                 extension of an archetype extensible object database model to                   incorporate notions of time; and (e) the development of suitable                user interfaces.  Anticipated applications of these                             investigations are in engineering, business, medical information                systems, scheduling, computer aided design and computer                         integrated manufacturing.",
