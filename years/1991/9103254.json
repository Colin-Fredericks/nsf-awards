 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study differential equations with                    symmetry and applications to solid mechanics.  The applications                 involve geometrically exact formulations of nonlinearly elastic                 and viscoelastic solids and structures.  The goals of the work                  are to detect new phenomena and to further develop and exploit                  the connection between symmetry and nodal properties of solutions               of elliptic equations, particularly in the context of global                    bifurcation and continuation problems.                                               The way that structures bend can be described                              mathematically as the solution of equations describing the                      structure.  Often the bending depends on a parameter, for                       instance the load on the structure,  If as the load varies the                  structure can bend in different ways for the same load, then the                solutions are said to bifurcate at that value of the load.                      Global descriptions of the bifurcations are generally hard to                   get, but are very valuable. When the structure is symmetric,                    those symmetries can be used to get a better grip on the global                 behavior.  Applications arise not only in analysing structures                  but also in studying the behavior of materials themselves.",
