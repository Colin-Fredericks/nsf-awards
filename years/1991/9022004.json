 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pacific Exploratory MIssion-West (PEM-WEST) is an                      international program aimed at understanding tropospheric ozone                 production and nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbon pre-cursors                       downstream of a major anthropogenic source region.  This mission                will be conducted in the western Pacific region during the                      summer/fall of 1991.  Both ground-based and aircraft platforms                  are expected to make important scientific contributions.  The                   longer temporal scale of the ground-based measurements will                     complement the short term, greater areal coverage of the aircraft               measurements.                                                                        The PI proposes to conduct measurements of NO and NOy at one               of the PEM-WEST intensive ground based stations for a period of                 six weeks.  These measurements are proposed to contribute to the                overall mission objectives to evaluate ozone photochemical                      production and loss rates as a function of altitude and                         geographic position, to examine transport fluxes and identify                   Asian source regions of advected ozone and ozone precursors, and                to conduct model studies of OH mixing ratios over the western                   Pacific from observations of O3, CH4, CO, NOx, and NMHC.",
