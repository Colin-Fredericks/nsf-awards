 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical activity of nerve cells is determined by ion channels                found within the cell membrane.  The electrical excitability of                 individual nerve cells depends upon the types of ion channels                   expressed, the relative and absolute densities, and the spatial                 distributions of ion channels in different regions of the cell.                 These factors have a functional significance and any modification               to these factors could be a cause of neuronal plasticity.  The                  molluscan nervous system provides an important model for the                    study of neural circuits and neuronal plasticity.  This research                project will investigate the mechanisms molluscan neurons use to                process information in the nervous system.  Electrophysiological                methods of voltage and patch clamping will be utilized to study                 the biophysics of membrane ion channels and to map the spatial                  distribution of ion channels in different areas of the cell.                    Biophysical properties that are modulated by activity, such as                  the inactivation gating of calcium and potassium, will be                       examined to help encode the time history of neuronal activity.                  Video fluorescence microscopy will be used to study the spatial                 patterning of intracellular calcium signals and the nature of the               cytoskeleton.  Results of this study will contribute to the                     understanding of neuronal information processing and the                        specializations responsible for the functional individuality of                 neurons.",
