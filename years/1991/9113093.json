 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding of men and women in American society encompasses             broad understanding of the attitudes of the diversity of racial and             ethnic groups within it.  One important aspect of that                          understanding is a knowledge of women's sex roles.  This Minority               Research Initiation Planning Grant studies comparatively the sex                role attitudes of married and unmarried African American women in               order to develop a conceptual framework for examining these                     attitudes which takes into consideration the social and historical              context of the experiences of African Americans.  Data from a                   national cross-sectional study of Black adults and a re-interview               subsample of this cross-sectional survey will be analyzed to assess             the significant predictors of the married and unmarried women's sex             role attitudes.                                                                                                                                                      This project will enhance our understanding of the factors                 contributing to the development of attitudes about women's sex                  roles.  This project also provides an excellent opportunity for a               promising young scholar to lay the foundation for building a more               comprehensive model of sex role attitudes than currently exists.",
