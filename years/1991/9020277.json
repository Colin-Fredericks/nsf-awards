 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Plant Resources Center of the University of Texas                      contains over one million specimens and 4,600 type specimens.                   The Center is one of the most active research herbariums in the                 world, and one of the premier repositories of plant specimens                   from the southwest U.S., Mexico, and Central America.  Several                  smaller herbarium collections have been absorbed into the Plant                 Resources Center during recent years, and the University of Texas               has provided newly renovated space to accommodate this growth.                  Dr. Beryl Simpson, Director of the Center, is overseeing the                    final stages of transferring the collections into new quarters.                 The proposed relocation and reorganization of the collections                   will make valuable research resources more accessible to the                    botanical community.                                                                 Natural history collections such as the Plant Resources                    Center are indispensable tools for research into the diversity of               life on Earth.  The continued growth and improvement of these                   collections will be critical if future generations of                           systematists, ecologists, biogeographers, and investigators from                diverse other disciplines are to have the essential resources for               their research.",
