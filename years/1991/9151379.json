 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is equipping a learning laboratory for the                         introductory and intermediate level physics laboratory classes                  which will encourage active participation by students in the                    learning process.  Students have been enthusiastic about the                    use of \"own-plans\" lab projects in the introductory courses.                    This approach has led to their engagement with the material and                 to increased understanding both of the material covered and of                  the scientific approach to problem solving.  The equipment                      being acquired includes two fully equipped 386-based computer                   workstations, each with general purpose AID converter and                       various probes; a computer-controlled videodisc system; two                     video cam-corders and two computer-assisted video-tape players.                 This equipment will enable the department to expand on the                      \"own-plans\" idea, extending it to the intermediate laboratory                   courses for physics majors, increasing the range of experiments                 students can do, and exposing them to modern instrumentation                    and current methods of data acquisition and analysis.NSF grant                  funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
