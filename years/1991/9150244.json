 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Albuquerque Public Schools seeks funds for a three-year                     program to enhance 15 teachers of grades K through 4 to                         become Fellows for the Advancement of Mathematics Education                     (FAME) and to serve as school-based mathematics teacher-                        leaders.  Each year Fellows will participate in a two-week                      summer session and weekly classes during the academic year.                     They will study such mathematical topics as number systems                      and number theory, algebra and geometry, the history of                         mathematics, computer application, discrete mathematics and                     intuitive calculus.   Attention will also be paid special                       concerns of teaching in a multicultural setting, learning                       theory as related to the learning of mathematics,                               pedagogical, leadership development, and working with                           parents.                                                                                                                                                        Each year, 15 additional teachers will be selected from the                     Fellows' schools to be FAME teachers.  These teachers will                      work closely with their Fellows to improve classroom                            mathematics instruction and will also study university                          mathematics content.  Fame Fellows will have extensive                          responsibilities as teacher-leaders and will receive                            released time to handle these responsibilities.                                                                                                                 It is anticipated that a minimum of 73 teachers will be                         enhanced.  Fame Fellows will earn 30 graduate credits which                     may be applied toward a master's program or an education                        specialist degree.                                                              Albuquerque Public Schools and the University of New                            Mexico's cost-sharing accounts for 26% of the NSF budget.                                                                                                       This project couples a solid mathematics component to a                         school-based leadership component.  It is run by and for                        teachers, with excellent backup by university mathematics                       and mathematics education staff.  It may serve as a model                       for K-4 district-wide systemic change in mathematics                            teaching and learning.",
