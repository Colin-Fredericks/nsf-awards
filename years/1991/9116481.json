ASCE has in                   effect Agreements of Cooperation with engineering societies in                  these countries (with the exception of the Czechoslovakian                      societies) and these agreements are instrumental in strengthening               the relationships between American civil engineers and those of the             countries where the Agreements exist.  This study mission will                  assist materially in cementing these relationships and energizing               future cooperative research efforts between U.S. engineers and                  those in these countries.  The mission to Hungary and                           Czechoslovakia is particularly significant in this regard as these              countries move from a centrally planned to a market-driven economy.",
