 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Jones will study examples of subfactors (both from               finite dimensional and infinite dimensional methods).  His                      techniques will involve the use of loop group representations, knot             theory, and statistical mechanics.  Of special importance is an                 attempt to understand the correspondence between statistical                    mechanics and knot theory.  This will be approached both by looking             at large knots and a procedure called Baxterization.                                 Jones' work has its basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert             space operators.  These are families of linear functions on a                   certain type of infinite dimensional space.  He is interested in                how nests of these algebras fit inside one another.  This seemingly             technical subject turns out to have very important implications for             a large variety of other areas of mathematics and physics including             knot theory and the theory of three dimensional manifolds                       (topology) and statistical mechanics (physics).",
