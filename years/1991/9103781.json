 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most plant populations will be structured genetically in                   space as a result of restricted gene flow and spatially                         heterogeneous selection.  However, the fine scale causes and                    consequences of within population genetic structure remain                      obscure.  The proposed research is aimed at determining the                     pattern of fine scale spatial genetic structure in populations of                                                                                               the montane herb Delphinium nelsonii and understanding how the                  pattern is produced.  Two populations will be sampled                           hierarchically to quantify genetic structure at wide range of                   spatial scales. In each population, individuals from several                    stages in the life cycle will be genotyped using isozyme                        electrophoresis.  Adult population structure will be                            characterized using three methods and compared to patterns                      estimated from empirical measures of pollen and seed dispersal                  distances.  Deviations in genetic diversity and population                      structure among different life history stages will be used to                   identify the timing and possible mechanisms of population                       subdivision.  Two techniques will be used to estimate the effects                                                                                               of heterozygosity and inbreeding on offspring survival.                         Controlled crosses between individuals of different combinations                                                                                                of spatial proximity and genetic similarity will be made.  Three                                                                                                measures of fitness, seed set, seed mass, and seed weight will be                                                                                               measured in the resulting progeny.  Analysis of variance will be                                                                                                used to decompose the relationship of genetic similarity at                                                                                                     electrophoretic marker loci and spatial proximity on the fitness                                                                                                consequences of outcrossing distance.",
