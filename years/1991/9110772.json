 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is now potential to synthesize circuits which contain                     Exclusive OR (EXOR) gates without the size and speed penalties                  formerly associated with them.  Circuits designed with EXOR                     technology can be efficiently implemented and are inherently                    testable.  Three research topics are being pursued.  The first is               to develop a comprehensive theory for design in the EXOR                        technology.  This theory forms the basis for development of                     algorithms for EXOR design.  Second is to develop a tool which                  produces an optimal, multilevel design that is a mixture of EXOR,               OR and AND gates for a given function.  Hierarchal decomposition                is being used to recognize different subfunctions.  Algorithms are              being developed for decomposition, factorization, and resynthesis.              Third is to explore algorithms for optimal design using                         programmable gate arrays and programmable logic devices.",
