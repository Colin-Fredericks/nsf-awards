 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant cell cultures are a potential source of important                         secondary metabolites such as medicinals.  Currently, low                       productivities have impeded the commercialization of a                          broad range of target compounds.  The compound targeted by                      this proposal is taxol, an exceptionally promising                              anti-cancer agent for ovarian cancer.  Taxol is currently                       extracted from the bark of a threatened plant species, is                       too complex for chemical synthesis, and is currently in                         very short supply.  Taxol is produced in tissue cultures,                       but a ten to hundred fold improvement in productivity is                        required for commercial feasibility.  The proposed research                     may lead to a commercial process for the production of                          taxol by plant tissue culture.",
