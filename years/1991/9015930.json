 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project is for participation by  U.S.                        scientists in an International Symposium/Workshop on                            Frontiers of Molecular Biological Research to be held in                        Lahore, Pakistan in September 1991.  The Pakistani                              organizer is Dr. S. Riazuddin, Director of the Center for                       Advanced Molecular Biology (CAMB) at the University of                          Panjab, Lahore.  Areas to be covered will include: repair                       enzymes, restriction enzymes, replication enzymes, plant                        microbe interaction, transgenic plant technology, and                           insecticidal proteins and other biological controls.  The                       meeting will be preceded by a two-week training course for                      twenty selected young university researchers who intend to                      pursue research careers in the field.  The purpose of the                       course will be to train researchers on advanced recombinant                     DNA techniques, on other methodologies and concepts that                        will form the basis for discussions in the                                      Symposium/Workshop.  Proceedings of papers presented and                        discussions will be printed and made available to the                           scientific communities in the two countries.                                                                                                                    Scope:  The field of molecular biology is becoming                              increasingly important in dealing with developing                               countries' problems such as production of food, medicines,                      and improving fuel sources and use.  U.S. and Pakistani                         scientists from the laboratories of Drs. Grossman and                           Riazuddin have been collaborating in joint research                             projects for over a decade.  This meeting allows this                           relationship to be expanded to include a larger number of                       Pakistani scientists and to help guide future local as well                     as joint research.",
