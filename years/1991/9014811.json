This                      annual conference has rotated between the U.S. and Europe for                   the past six years, and is the main international conference                    for lattice field theory.  In lattice field theory, one                         attempts to understand theoretically the strong nuclear                         interactions of the elementary particles by making an                           approximation in which the continuum of space is replaced by a                  discrete lattice of points.                                                          Topics that will be extensively discussed at this                          conference include lattice computations of the masses of                        strongly-interacting particles, the potential between quarks,                   weak nuclear processes, the phase transition in which quarks                    become free, and new developments in algorithms and special                     purpose machines.                                                                    The annual Lattice conference regularly draws about 200 of                 the most outstanding researchers in the field, and provides                     them with an important opportunity to exchange ideas in an area                 of research which has become a major component of theoretical                   elementary particle physics.",
