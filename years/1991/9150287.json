 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project utilizes recent progress in educational techniques                 and computers to provide undergraduates with interactive access                 to a full range of laboratory optical technology, from the                      simplest to the latest high technology optics, while reducing                   cost and unifying the learning experience in physics and                        engineering.  The need for national preeminence in the area of                  rapid and precise handling of optical information requires                      students who are well and consistently trained across the                       spectrum of optics in physics and engineering.  The project is                  based in CUPLE (Comprehensive Unified Physics Learning                          Environment) program, which provides a base of computational                    and video techniques.  It provides access to a broad range of                   optics technology in a consistent manner that enables the                       student to move in an interactive manner from familiar to less                  familiar material.  This program is comprehensive, because it                   draws on innovative developments in classroom, laboratory,                      lecture demonstration, and computer based materials developed                   by a consortium of excellent educators and unified in that it                   presents a consistent user interface to students, lecturers,                    and experimentailsts across different applications and                          different media, such as laboratory instruments, data arrays,                   graphical displays, and video recordings.  This approach can                    bring a larger number of undergraduate students into closer and                 more timely contact with laboratory experience in a flexible                    manner at significantly reduced cost as compared to                             conventional methods.  The present project is developing a set                  of trial modules on modern optics combining instruction                         simulation, and experiments within the CUPLE environment.",
