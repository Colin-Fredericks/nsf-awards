 "awd_abstract_narration": "The this project seeks to improve the appeal and                                approachability of science to college students by preparing                     materials to be used with science fiction films to teach                        science and its relationships to technology and society.  Among                 the principal outcomes will be a student textbook, Learning                     Science Through Science Fiction Films, suitable for use as the                  primary or secondary textbook for an introductory level                         physics, physical science, biology or technology course for                     non-science majors, and including an accompanying instructor's                  manual.  Both volumes will be published by the American                         Institute of Physics.  Prior NSF support has demonstrated that                  using science fiction films to teach science has a very                         positive effect on students' attitudes towards science,                         knowledge of science as a discovery process, and cognitive                      development.  The project materials will be tested with classes                 of college students, and faculty will be trained to use the                     materials.The institutional support for this project exceeds                    the award.",
