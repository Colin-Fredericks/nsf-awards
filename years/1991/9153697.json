 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1988, a major five-year program known as E4 and entitled \"An                 Enhanced Educational Experience for Engineering Students\" was                   launched by Drexel University and the National Science                          Foundation.  This program focuses on the revision of the lower                  division engineering curriculum, and includes the Introductory                  Engineering Laboratory (IEL).  This project uses the IEL as a                   physical and intellectual foundation to develop a new Advanced                  Engineering Laboratory (AEL).  The AEL is integrated with the                   IEL with respect to philosophy, perspective, organization,                      program, and equipment.  The objectives are 1) to capitalize on                 developed student skills while focusing on sophisticated                        specialized or interdisciplinary experiments; 2) to enhance the                 scope, efficiency and effectiveness of existing upper-division                  laboratories; 3) to develop new experimental configurations;                    and 4) to serve as a model facility and strategy for providing                  a diverse, sophisticated and cost-effective environment for                     teaching the theory and practice of modern engineering                          experimentation.  This phase of the project addresses the                       analysis, design, and prototype development and testing of the                  AEL.",
