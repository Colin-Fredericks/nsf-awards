 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will continue his               study of vector fields that are homogeneous with respect to a                   dilation in order to apply these results to the approximation of                solutions of nonlinear differential equations and control                       systems.  In particular, he will study the existence of                         asymptotically stabilizing feedback controls for nonlinear                      systems via homogeneous approximations, and then he will attempt                to construct such feedback controls for systems that are small-                 time locally controllable about their uncontrolled rest state.                  The construction of asymptotically stabilizing feedback controls                remains one of the fundamental problems of control theory.                           Control systems are a common feature of modern everyday                    life.  Think of the thermostat in your home that controls the                   furnace or the air-conditioner.  Many of these control systems                  are governed by linear equations, and for them there is now an                  extensive and nearly complete theory.  On the other hand, many                  technologically important control systems are nonlinear, that is,               the process to be controlled is governed by a nonlinear equation                or system of equations.  For nonlinear control systems the theory               is far from complete.  In this project the principal investigator               will seek approximate solutions of nonlinear control problems by                means of sophisticated methods based upon linear system theory.",
