 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to deduce how the genome specifies                  neuronal connections by focussing on mutation that alter a                      particular identifiable synapse in the adult Drosophila nervous                 system.  The synapse is part of the giant fiber escape                          system; it connects the giant fiber interneuron and the jump                    muscle motoneuron.  Mutations which alter the structure and/or                  function of the giant fiber-jump muscle motoneuron connection may               be identified by a combination of behavioral,                                   electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical methods.  One such                    mutation defines the bendless (ben) gene which appears to play a                key role late in the formation of neuronal connections.  It may                 be involved in the final recognition events between a presynaptic               neuron and its post-synaptic target.  Dr. Tanouye will conduct a                detailed genetic and phenotypic analysis of ben to determine the                nature of its role in neuronal connectivity.  He will then clone                the ben gene, determine if its product has amino acid homology to               other known molecules, and study the spatial and temporal pattern               of its expression.  The detailed genetic and molecular                          description of how one particular synapse is formed may serve as                a model that gives insight into the general problem of neuronal                 connectivity.",
