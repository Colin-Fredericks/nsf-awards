It is                         motivated by applications in biomedical microscopy,                             and uses microscopy as a theoretical and                                        experimental model system, but the problems,                                    methods, and results of this research are of broad                              significance in optical engineering.  Models for image                          formation, degradation and restoration will be based                            on the polarization aberration expansion,                                       decomposing polarization variations in the pupil in a                           manner analogous to classical wave aberration theory.                           Models for two and three-dimensional imaging in tow                             specific systems, the polarization and differential                             interference contrast microscopes, will be developed                            and tested by experimental observations.  Image                                 quality will be evaluated by point-spread and                                   modulation transfer functions.  Methods for                                     measuring polarization aberrations will be sought.                              Understanding image formation, degradation, and                                 restoration in polarization-sensitive systems will                              provide guidance for future instrument designs, and                             will support a unified approach to system design                                through understanding the respective contributions                              and tradeoffs of the optics, image sensor, and post-                            processor.",
