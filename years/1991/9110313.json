The further development                                            of ECR plasma processing technology                                             requires that the operation of the                                              reactors be better understood and                                               characterized.  This Research                                                   Initiation Award project is                                                     investigating ECR plasmas through                                               numerical modeling techniques and                                               diagnostic techniques.  The                                                     objectives of this study are to                                                 investigate the spatial uniformity                                              species and electrons.  The                                                     significance of these studies is                                                that they will produce a predictive                                             model of the reactors and improve                                               the plasma reactors by directing                                                future applications.  The ECR plasma                                            reactor studied consist of a single                                             mode microwave cavity that supplies                                             the energy to a plasma production                                               region which has a multipolar static                                            magnetic field.  The experimental                                               diagnostics data to be utilized to                                              verify and refine the numerical                                                 models includes data collected using                                            laser induced fluorescence                                                      spectroscopy, coherent anti-Stokes                                              Raman spectroscopy, emission                                                    spectroscopy, actinometry, electric                                             field probing, magnetic field                                                   probing, ion energy analysis, and                                               Langmuir probe measurements.",
