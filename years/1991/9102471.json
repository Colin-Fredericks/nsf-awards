 "awd_abstract_narration": "The simplest of infinite groups is the free group on a                     finite number of letters.  Here an element of the group is a word               in the letters and their inverses.  Two words are equal if and                  only if after iteratively canceling consecutive occurrences of a                letter and its inverse the two words become the same.  Gromov                   initiated the study of a class of groups, called \"negatively                    curved,\" that share some of the computational ease of a free                    group.  The first part of this project is to continue the                       exploration of these groups and to extend this study to include a               class of groups that the investigator calls \"relatively                         negatively curved.\"                                                                  We say we have tiled the complex plane if we have expressed                the plane as a union of finitely many congruent pieces, the                     tiles, that are pairwise disjoint up to their boundaries.  The                  tiles need not be connected and their boundaries may be fractal.                The tiling is self-similar if there is a complex number b                       associated to the tiling such that multiplication by b takes each               tile to a union of tiles.  An example is the famous Penrose                     tiling.  Thurston has identified the complex numbers that can be                associated to self-similar tilings.  The second part of this                    project is to determine which complex numbers may be associated                 to tilings by disks and which numbers may be associated to                      tilings by polygons.",
