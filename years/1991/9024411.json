 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major objective of this project is to use nonstandard                    analysis to give a general metatheorem which reduces existence                  problems for continuous-time stochastic processes to                            corresponding statements about discrete-time processes.                              A step towards the objective was taken in the forthcoming                  paper, \"From Discrete to Continuous Time\".  In that paper, a                    concept of forcing was introduced, and it was proved that a wide                class of statements about continuous-time stochastic processes                  are true if and only if forced by a sequence of discrete-time                   stochastic processes.  This forcing theorem can be used to prove                a variety of existence theorems.  For example, the method gives                 proofs of the existence of solutions of many stochastic                         differential equations.  The discrete-time statement is often                   easy to prove, and the forcing theorem does most of the work                    required to get from there to the continuous-time statement.                         The forcing theorem is presently formulated in a way which                 is natural from the point of view of mathematical logic but is                  often more difficult to apply than one would hope.  One reason                  for this is that one must first show that the statement to be                   proved is expressible in terms of \"liftable functions\", which are               defined in a technical way using nonstandard analysis.  The                     investigator is working toward a more general and more convenient               forcing theorem which would use nonstandard notions in its proof                but not in its application.  To complement this effort, the scope               of the method will be tested by developing a wider variety of                   applications to particular problems in probability theory.                           It is surprising that deep methods from mathematical logic                 can be used to obtain alternative and often simpler proofs in the               theory of probability.  However, the investigator has been very                 successful in demonstrating this by example over a period of many               years.",
