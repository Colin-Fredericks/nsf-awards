 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geochemical, sedimentological and paleontologic evidence from              deep sea sedimentary sequences indicates that significant changes               in the ocean climate and chemical system occurred from the late                 Paleocene to early Eocene.  The early Eocene climate was                        characterized by elevated temperatures at high latitudes and in                 deep oceans, by diminished thermal gradients, and by decreased                  atmospheric circulation.  Moreover, the mean isotopic composition               of marine carbonate dropped by 3 part per mil.  Climate models                  indicate that such decreases in planetary temperature gradient must             have had profound effects on continental climates.  Paleocene-                  Eocene climate change has been proposed as an important driving                 force in the evolution of continental plants and animals.  However,             verification of model results with empirical data is difficult                  because of the low precision of marine-terrestrial correlations and             because of a general lack of quantitative terrestrial climate                   proxies.                                                                             This study has two goals: 1) to correlate with greater                     precision Paleocene through early Eocene marine strata to                       continental sections from the Bighorn Basin, WY, and 2) to evaluate             changes in mean annual temperature and humidity in continental                  regions.  Large scale, synchronous perturbations in the carbon                  isotope composition of terrestrial carbon reservoirs (organic                   matter, soil carbonates, and tooth apatite) and marine carbonates               will supply isochrons for correlation.  Temperature and humidity                will be determined through oxygen isotope analysis of soil                      carbonates, and teeth from terrestrial and aquatic mammals.",
