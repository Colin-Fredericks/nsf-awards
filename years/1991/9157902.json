This                      project involves investigation of the extent and rate of                        organic contaminant uptake by natural solids found in                           soils and determination of the controlling mechanisms.                                                                                                          This is the initial, base-level award for this PYI.                             Results of this research are likely to be applied in                            engineering design of processes and systems for                                 decontamination of soil contaminated by organic chemicals                       from accidental spills or by substances leaching from                           disposal sites for hazardous wastes.  The results may also                      be applied in engineering design of treatment processes                         for removal of organic contaminants from water.",
