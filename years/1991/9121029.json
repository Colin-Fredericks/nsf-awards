This symposium is planned to be                           conducted in associative relationship with a national                           meeting of the American Chemical Society in the spring of                       1992.  Major topics for the symposium, scheduled for April                      8 and 9, 1992 include surface phenomena that affect                             chemical reactions in aquatic systems, aspects of earth                         contact, biological processes, oxidation-reduction and                          photocatalyzed reactions in dilute aqueous solutions that                       affect  engineering approaches to management of water                           quality.                                                                                                                                                        Results of this Symposium are expected to provide guidance                      to the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in planning                      and conduct of research in aquatic chemistry applicable to                      the dispersion, diffusion and interactions of chemical                          pollutants in the  environment.",
