 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor William Rose of Michigan                      Technological University in a research collaboration with                       Professor Zoltan de Cserna of the Institute de Geologia of                      the National Autonomous University  (UNAM) of Mexico.  The                      objective of the research is to carry out a detailed study of                   the later eruptive products of Citlaltepetl volcano, in order                   to describe its explosivity, sequence of volcanic events and                    general evolution.  The work will result in a modern                            characterization of a large glaciated sub-tropical strato-                      volcano, which will facilitate important volcanic hazard                        evaluations.  The analysis of this information will provide                     important support for the second goal, the establishment of                     specific volcanic hazard planning for the Citlaltepetl                          region.                                                                                                                                                         Citlaltepetl is the highest peak in Mexico (5675m) and the                      third highest peak in North America.  It is the easternmost                     volcano of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, located on an                        important normal fault zone that marks the central plateau                      from the Mexican Gulf coastal plains.  Citlaltepetl  volcano                    has been proposed for volcanological research because of the                    perceived potential volcanic hazards for the surrounding                        areas and because there is only a limited amount of geological                  or volcanological information available at present.  Such a                     volcano is an important target for detailed study because                       high, glaciated tropical volcanoes have rarely been thoroughly                  described and, as the experience at Nevado de Ruiz volcano                      (colombia) (Naranjo et al., 1986) in 1985 shows, are                            inadequately understood and particularly dangerous.",
