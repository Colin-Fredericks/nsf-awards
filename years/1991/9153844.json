 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year summer program, sponsored by the University                       of Northern Colorado, meets five weeks each summer to teach                     40 pre-high school teachers (grades 6-8) chemistry                              fundamentals.  The teachers are selected from a national                        pool of applicants.  The program features:  (1) chemistry                       content presentations and discussions, (2) laboratory                           activities, (3) laboratory safety sessions, (4) teaching                        sessions and (5) planning sessions on outreach activities.                      The content of the program will emphasize the core topics                       common to most middle school curricula, development of                          pedagogical techniques and the treatment of misconceptions.                     Emphasis will also be placed on learning about the                              relationship of chemistry to technology and the other                           sciences.  Participants will also be able to work with                          middle school children enrolled in the summer Chemistry                         camp held at the University of Northern Colorado at the                         same time as the project.  At the end of the program a                          collection of exemplary workshop teaching materials for                         pre-high school teachers will be prepared and disseminated.                     The ICE national center will support the project through                        publicity, evaluation of the program and preparation of the                     teaching materials.  The NSF grant is being matched by                          institutional funds and ICE funds in the amount of more                         than 13%.",
