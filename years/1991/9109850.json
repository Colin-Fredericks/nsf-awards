 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kangaroo rats are nocturnal rodents found only in the deserts of                North America.  Although they are part of the rich web of life in               the deserts of the Southwestern United States, little was                       understood about their communication and social organization                    until Dr. Randall began her research on them.  She is continuing                to examine how members of one species, the banner-tailed kangaroo               rat, communicate their identity to other species of kangaroo rats               and protect themselves from predators by drumming their hind feet               on the ground to create air-borne and ground-transmitted                        vibrations.                                                                                                                                                     Footdrumming is a unique communication system that has never been               studied in detail in any other animal besides the banner-tailed                 kangaroo rat.  In this project, Dr. Randall is opening research                 into footdrumming as seismic communication by investigating                     whether or not banner-tails can communicate underground from                    territory to territory.  She will also explore the possibility of               cultural transmission of footdrumming signals:  Individual                      footdrumming signatures of mothers are possibly learned by their                offspring and then modified as the young animals establish                      themselves in new territories with new neighbors.  Finally, Dr.                 Randall will examine in much greater detail than before                         communication between kangaroo rats and snakes, focusing on                     whether or not banner-tails footdrum in the presence of snakes to               induce them to leave by informing them that their chances of                    predation are low.                                                                                                                                              Because most research on mammalian communication by sound has                   been done on highly social species, this study provides important               comparative evidence for the evolution of sound communication in                nonsocial mammals.  In addition, the research will contribute to                an understanding of fragile desert ecosystems.  Because the                     banner-tailed kangaroo rat was recently listed as an endangered                 species in Arizona, Dr. Randall's research could become very                    important in conservation efforts and recovery programs to assure               the survival of the banner-tail and other endangered kangaroo-rat               species.",
