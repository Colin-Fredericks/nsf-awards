 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Eric Heller is supported by a grant from the                          Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                      research in the area of molecular spectroscopy and dynamics.                    This theoretical research will have a major impact on                           furthering our fundamental understanding of molecular processes                 involved in chemical reactions.                                                                                                                                 Several distinct but interrelated lines of research in the                      areas of time dependent quantum mechanics, semiclassical                        methods, molecular spectrosocpy, and quantum chaology will be                   explored.  A new and very fast quantum propagation method will                  be developed.  A basis set technique for treating high energy                   anharmonic dynamics will be studied.  New methods in theory of                  radiationless transitions will be developed which allow                         classical trajectories to be used with greater accuracy.  Deep                  tunneling matrix elements in intersystem crossing and                           nonvertical spectroscopy will be analyzed as potential                          semiclassical phase space tools.  The spectra of highly                         anharmonic and possibly classically chaotic molecules, for                      example the full SEP spectrum of acetylene, will be studied in                  light of the time dependent wavepacket picture of electronic                    spectroscopy.  The theory of scars in eigenstates will be                       extended to include nonlinear dynamics.  The Raman spectra and                  dynamics of multi-chromophore molecules will also be studied.",
