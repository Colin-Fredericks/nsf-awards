 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working with Drs. Thomas Ricketts, Paul Guyer, and Gary Hatfield,               Dr. Richardson is examining the late 19th and early 20th century                philosophical and scientific background in Germany against which                logical empiricism was developed in the 1920s.  In particular, he               is looking at the problematic of seeking the correct understanding              of the role of logic and mathematics in empirical scientific                    knowledge that guides most of the scientifically oriented                       epistemological schools (Neo-Kantians, Psychologists,                           Phenomenologists) in Germany during the fifty years before the rise             of logical empiricism.  Moreover, he is investigating the                       methodological remarks of the leading scientists of this time                   (Helmholtz, Mach, Planck, Poincare, Duhem, Einstein) and the                    interpretation of those remarks by German philosophers to see how               scientific achievements were philosophically understood in this                 period.  This is part of a larger project to understand the                     philosophical and scientific pressures leading to the development               of the though of Rudolf Carnap from his Neo-Kantian first writings              through his constructive program of 1928 to mature empiricism in                his work in the 1930s.",
