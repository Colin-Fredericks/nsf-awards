 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a joint Clarkson-Yale University project for the                   investigation of novel computational techniques to exploit                      intrinsic characteristics of boundary element analysis (BEA), for               truly large scale problems on contemporary/emerging computers,                  removing bottlenecks to high performance computing by examining                 steps currently consuming up to 95% of overall computational                    resources.  Special regard is given to the effectiveness of these               techniques in the design process where solution of sequences of                 evolving problems and design sensitivity analysis are required.                 Iterative equation solving, vector/parallel numerical integration,              and iterative reanalysis and design sensitivity analysis, in a high             performance computing environment, is being investigated.                            The knowledge gained, will facilitate the use of significantly             more refined BEA simulations, predicting system response with                   increased fidelity, earlier in the engineering process, add to the              general efficiency of BEA vis-a-vis finite element and finite                   difference analysis, and help make tractable the coupling of                    accurate three-dimensional simulation with programmed intelligence              in overall analysis and optimization systems of practical utility               in the mainstream of engineering and design.",
