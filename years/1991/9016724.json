 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collection of invertebrate fossils in the Academy of                   Natural Sciences, Philadelphia includes 4,000 type specimens and                one million specimens in 104,000 lots, half of which are                        currently cataloged.  The collection is composed predominantly of               Tertiary molluscs from eastern North America, and includes                      historically important collections.  Prior NSF support has                      initiated the process of rearranging the collection from                        stratigraphic to systematic order, sequestration of types, and                  computerization of all lots.  Dr. Gary Rosenberg, Curator of the                collection, is now embarking on the first phase of a ten-year                   plan to computerize the type specimens as well as the systematic                collections.  Type specimens will be photographed and analyzed                  from a conservation perspective and remedial actions taken to                   halt deterioration.  A type catalog will be published in the                    Academy's malacological journal Tyronia.                                             The proposed curatorial improvements will benefit a wide                   audience of paleontologists, malacologists, ecologists, and                     biogeographers.  The proposed improvements will reverse the                     effects of prior neglect, and will make this valuable research                  resource easily accessible to investigators.  Systematic                        collections of fossils may prove to be the most valuable tool for               gauging the rate of extinction and environmental change on Earth,               and the proper care of these collections is critical to future                  generations of researchers.",
