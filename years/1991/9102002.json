 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator works in the area of Recursion Theory, in                 particular, Turing degrees of unsolvability.  Consider the                      natural partial ordering of the degrees of sets computable from                 A.   The investigator will study this in the case where A is                    Cohen generic for n-quantifier arithmetic.  A property is not                   easily seen to be satisfied in this ordering for n-generic A if                 it has more complexity than n.  One needs a priority argument as                well as a forcing argument.  The investigator is developing this                theory.  He has provided a complementation theorem and minimal                  cover theorem.  He plans now to study whether these results hold                for l-generic degrees.  He will also try to solve isomorphism and               automorphism questions which are related to the homogeneity                     conjecture for the whole structure of Turing degrees.  These                    questions have been open for more than twenty years.                                 The degree of computability of a set is measured by its                    Turing degree.  Higher degrees signify the need for more powerful               computational principles.  Although actual machines cannot embody               these higher powers, the mind-set engendered by recursion theory                has been fruitful for those studying machine computability.",
