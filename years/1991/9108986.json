 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to extend ongoing work in reservoirs and               small impoundments, pursuing an evaluation of the generality of                 the trophic cascade hypothesis.  This hypothesis is currently                   being tested in north temperate open-water and inshore, benthic                 communities.  Southeastern reservoirs, the focus of this work,                  differ dramatically from northern lakes in that an open-water                   omnivore, gizzard shad, occurs in abundance.  Neither controlled                by fish predators (owing to impressive fecundity coupled with a                 narrow window of vulnerability to predators) nor by their                       zooplankton prey (following the mid-summer zooplankton crash,                   shad switch to detritus and phytoplankton), gizzard shad regulate               community composition via \"middle-out\" processes, rather than                   being regulated by top-down or bottom-up forces.  These                         investigators have designed a series of experiments across a                    range of spatial scales (1 m3 to 100 hectares) to evaluate                      whether gizzard shad can control zooplankton populations and                    hence recruitment of bluegill (via exploitative competition for                 zooplankton) and largemouth bass (by reducing their bluegill                    prey).  Preliminary evidence gathered during the past 5 years                   strongly supports the perspective that gizzard shad may well                    drive community composition in Ohio reservoirs, thus serving as a               \"critical\" species that may well operate in a \"middle-out\"                      fashion.  The experimental approach of this study will evaluate                 the generality of the cascade hypothesis by assessing its                       conceptual strength in reservoir food webs comprised of weak                    biotic linkages.",
