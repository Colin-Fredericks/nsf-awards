 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to conduct a workshop composed of NSF grantees               whose awards were made in the two years of competitions under the               Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology (CT2)                          Initiative.  Three additional grantees whose work is closely                    related are also included.  The total number of grants involved                 is twenty.  The purposes of the workshop are:  First, to provide                a forum for the exchange of knowledge in the form of                            perspectives, findings, methods and theory for this young,                      interdisciplinary field.  Second, to provide an opportunity for                 the field to coalesce and grow.  While certain subsets of the                   community of researchers mingle at various professional meetings,               as a whole, these investigators do not have regular contact.  The               workshop provides an opportunity to establish an identity for the               area of work and to plan subsequent activities.  Third, this                    provides an opportunity for the research from these 20 projects                 to be made more visible to the Washington based research funding                and policy community.  This workshop represents a planning                      opportunity for the IT&O Program.  The future research agenda for               CT2 funding and community building is an important part of the                  workshop program.  The workshop is held on June 3-5, 1991 in                    Washington, D.C.  A workshop report will be prepared and made                   available through publications and in response to requests.",
