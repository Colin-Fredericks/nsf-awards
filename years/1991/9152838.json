 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving the chemistry, physics, physical                      science, and mathematics curriculum at Central Alabama                          Community College through the development of an Open                            Science/Mathematics Computer Laboratory. The Open Laboratory                    expands the use of computers in mathematics and science classes                 and laboratories using an integrated four level instructional                   approach. The four levels of instruction include: (1) computer                  simulation, (2) data analysis and graphing,(3) data                             acquisition, and (4) construction of a computer interface                       device. This stepped approach is allowing students to become                    familiar with one level of computer use before proceeding to                    the next, more difficult level of instruction. Interactive                      video discs/software and conventional software, previously used                 as lecture demonstrations, are being used by individual                         students to enhance their laboratory experiences. Students are                  seeing how computer skills important in one subject area can be                 applied to and overlap with other disciplines. Russell                          Corporation, a local manufacturer, is matching the NSF grant in                 support of the project.",
