 "awd_abstract_narration": "French Guiana, a small department of France in northeastern                South America, still harbors one of the largest expanses of                     tropical wilderness in the world.  Situated in the geographic                   center of the department, the small village of Saul is surrounded               by 133,600 hectares of pristine rainforest proposed as a French                 national park in 1975.                                                               This project, which is based upon botanical explorations since             1976 by the principal investigator and since 1965 by his French                 collaborators, is designed to produce a flora of the proposed park.             The flora will allow scientists and tourists alike to be able to                identify the ferns and flowering plants of the park.  As a result,              the area will become more valuable as a living laboratory for the               study of tropical nature.  It will promote the discovery of                     evolutionary relationships in one of the most species rich areas                in the world and provide the baseline data needed for the                       recuperation of degraded rainforests throughout northeastern South              America.                                                                             Another goal of the project is to promote ecotourism in the                area by making a visit to the park a more educational experience.               The flora will be well illustrated with line drawings and colored               photographs, and the keys for plant identification will be made as              user friendly as possible.  Editions of the flora will be published             in French (edited by the French collaborators) and English.",
