 "awd_abstract_narration": "A cohort of students is to be instructed by the principal                       investigator in four successive chemical engineering courses,                   beginning with the introductory sophomore course.  The courses                  incorporate a number of teaching methods that have been shown                   by educational research to promote effective learning,                          including inductive/global presentation, open-ended problems,                   problem creation exercises, cooperative (team-based) learning,                  and assessment and remediation of motivation and study skill                    deficiencies.  Two groups are studied: an experimental group                    consisting of students who experience the proposed approach for                 three or more semesters, and a comparison group of students who                 progress through the regular curriculum.  The products of the                   research include a detailed profile of entering engineering                     students--distribution by sex and race, high school and                         freshman year records, reasons for selecting engineering,                       expectations of success, and levels of confidence and anxiety.                  The objective of the research is to demonstrate that the                        systematic and repeated use of the methods listed above can                     have significant beneficial effects on academic performance,                    retention, problem solving ability, and attitude toward                         engineering as a curriculum and career choice. The effects are                  expected to be particularly pronounced for minority students                    and other students considered to be at-risk academically.",
