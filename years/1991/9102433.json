 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports collaborative research on the chemistry                     of natural compounds.  It will be conducted by Dr. David                        Kingston of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State                          University in cooperation with Alphonse Kelecom of the                          Federal University in Fluminense, Brazil.  This work is                         aimed at the isolation and structure elucidation of novel                       chemical compounds from Brazilian plants and marine organisms.                  Both plants and marine organisms have proved important                          sources of novel antitumor agents, and it is expected that a                    continued search of Brazilian flora and marine species will                     yield additional useful compounds.                                                                                                                              The work in Brazil will be carried out by Dr. Kelecom, who                      will make both marine and terrestrial collections and perform                   preliminary bioassys and isolations.  The work in the U.S.A.                    will be carried out by Professor Kingston and his group,                        and will include the final purification of bioactive                            constituents and their structure elucidation.  The major                        benefit of this project to Dr. Kelecom is that it gives him                     access to the necessary equipment and expertise to complete                     the isolation and structure elucidation.  The major benefit                     to Dr. Kingston is that it gives him access to an enlarged                      group of plants and marine organisms for the isolation of                       natural compounds.",
