 "awd_abstract_narration": "The California Academy of Sciences produces a science news                 radio feature \"EARTHNEWS\" which has aired daily on twelve radio                 stations in California for nine years.  \"EARTHNEWS\" is a                        background to regular news and provides in-depth interpretation                 of science and environmental events to assist the public in                     understanding what they hear or read.  In response to a very                    large volume of mail from listeners, a quarterly newsletter was                 created four years ago to announce program schedules, enhance                   the information presented on the radio, and offer scientists                    and teachers a written forum for sharing ideas.                                                                                                                      Positive response from the listening audience suggests                     that this feature has tremendous potential for reaching a broad                 national audience.  The Columbia Broadcasting System has agreed                 to air three 60-second \"EARTHNEWS\" features each week and to                    distribute these features nationwide via satellite.  A total of                 156 features will be produced annually, each reaching an                        estimated national audience of twelve to fifteen million                        people.  The California Academy of Sciences is requesting                       funding for program research and production to develop this                     national radio program and to continue production of the                        newsletter.",
