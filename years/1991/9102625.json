 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in extracting properties from action               semantics definitions and in improving programs by partial evaluation.          Results from the two areas will be combined into a methodology for              compiler construction based on staging semantic definitions                     automatically.  Such a methodology will ultimately be implemented as a          part of a programming language design and analysis workbench.\"                  Property extraction from action semantics builds on earlier research            on models and type inference for programs coded in action semantics             notation.  Type inference algorithms will be extended so that analysis          can be undertaken on language definitions per si to elicit key                  properties regarding block-structuredess and strong typing.  Such               information is crucial to the automated construction of correct and             efficient compilers.                                                            Research on partial evaluation has centered on effective program                improvement based on partial knowledge of the nature of a program's             input, for example, its type.  Application of partial evaluation to             compiler generation from interpreter definitions has proved fruitful.           The work is to be extended so that it formalizes and automates the              \"staging\" of and interpretive specification into a static semantics             processor and a dynamic semantics processor.",
