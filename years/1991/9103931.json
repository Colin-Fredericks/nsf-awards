 "awd_abstract_narration": "The traditional story of the Scientific Revolution of the                     seventeenth century is currently undergoing extensive revision,                 with some arguing that the concept of a scientific revolution                   in the seventeenth century should be abandoned altogether.  A                   study of the early work on mathematical probability theory of                   Jacob Bernoulli, a professor at Basel, Switzerland, his nephew                  Nicolaus Bernoulli, who taught at the University of Padua, and                  their relations to John Bernoulli, Jacob's brother, who worked                  at Groningen, in Holland, can help to shed a new perspective                    on seventeenth century scientific developments.  The largest                    part of the research will concern early mathematical                            probability theory and its social context.  There will also be                  consideration of proposed new interpretations of what happened                  in seventeenth century science from the feminist perspective.                     The project is expected to provide new insights about the                     scientific revolution.  It furthers VPW program objectives to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     science or engineering through research, and to encourage other                 women to pursue careers in these areas through the                              investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the host                   campuses.  In this project, the proposed activities which                       contribute to the second objective include:  teaching a course                  on the Scientific Revolution and/or a course on the history of                  women in science, through which the investigator will examine                   and test new feminist interpretations against the evidence; and                 participating in the support activities of the Douglass Project                 for Rutgers Women in Math, Science, and Engineering.",
