 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of normal topological spaces has long been an                    important topic in classical set-theoretic topology and, more                   recently, the structure theory of normal locally compact                        Hausdorff spaces has been of spacial interest.  Several well-                   known problems, mostly involving topological spaces in the                      classes of normal or normal locally compact spaces, will be                     studied by the investigators.  It is expected that set-theoretic                techniques such as forcing, infinite combinatorics and large                    cardinals will be the principle tools used in the eventual                      solution of these problems.                                                          Set theory lies at the foundations of mathematics in that                  all of mathematics can in principle be built up from set theory,                albeit laboriously, by adding appropriate definitions, deriving                 consequences from the chosen axioms, and then compressing their                 statements by use of the definitions.  Some topics lie closer to                set theory, however, by virtue of needing fewer added definitions               in this process.  Classical set-theoretic topology is such a                    subject, really a very close neighbor, and so it shares some of                 the philosophical importance of set theory itself.",
