 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key requirement of division of labor in social insect                    colonies is the ability to respond flexibly to environmental                    change.  This ability is crucial to survival in variable                        environments.  Recent evidence suggests a significant part of                   observed behavioral variation in social insect colonies is                      genetically based.  In the research, the role of genetic                        variation in colony flexibility and task regulation by the honey                bee, Apis mellifera will be examined.                                                Dr. Fewell will examine stimulus threshold model which                     describes how genotypic diversity may function as a mechanism for               regulating division of labor in social insects.  This model                     proposes that individual workers have genetically linked                        thresholds to perform a given task, and that a range of genotypic               within a colony provides a range of  tendencies to perform that                 task.  From this model, one can predict that the genotypic                      composition of the population performing a task will change as                  environmental conditions and, therefore, stimulus environments                  change.  Dr. Fewell will test this prediction by changing colony                need for pollen and measuring associated changes in the genetic                 composition of the pollen and nectar foraging populations.  This                will be the first experimental test of the role of genotypic                    variation in social insect foraging regulation.  These studies                  will address the important question of whether current hypotheses               on the role of genotype in honey bee foraging apply to naturally                mated colonies.  They also will involve the application of a new                set of molecular genetic techniques, PCR and RAPD analysis, to                  behavioral questions in social insects.",
