Hence, the same abstract is cited with both                  projects.                                                                            The study aims to determine the departmental conditions and                programs that do and do not work to improve the participation and               performance of women in doctoral education--thus addressing the                 critical national problem of human resources in science.  Its                   purpose is to identify and assess organizational factors--such as               entry into area of specialty, inclusion in or exclusion from the                culture of the workplace, and the role of evaluative factors--that              affect the participation of women in doctoral education, their                  retention, reported satisfaction, publication productivity, and job             placement.                                                                           The project is a cross disciplinary analysis of women's                    success in doctoral education in physics, chemistry, biology,                   electrical engineering, and computer science, focusing upon the                 departmental environment.  The study employs in-depth interviews,               institutional analyses, and surveys of quantitative indicators at               three types of departmental sites:  (1) departments with                        significant programs in place to remedy problems women face in                  academic science--the vantage point of programs; (2) departments                that have made objectively notable improvements in the                          participation of women (in the absence of programs); and                        departments that have made no progress in raising the enrollment                levels and graduation rates of women students--also the vantage                 point of outcomes.                                                                   The research is relevant to policy intervention at the                     doctoral stage of science education for women; (1) it encourages                creation of a critical mass of women faculty in academic science                and engineering; (2) it revises the image of high level careers in              science and engineering for women from an anomalous to a more                   \"normal\" role, thereby enhancing the incentive of achievement among             younger people.//",
