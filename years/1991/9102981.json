 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spectral methods have been shown to be effective in approximating               the high gradient bands which occur during failure processes.                   These methods are effective in solid mechanics when applied in                  small patches or domains, which correspond to the high gradient                 regions such as shear bands, coupled with a finite element                      discretization of the rest of the problem.  Here, adaptive                      procedures will be developed to determine the location and extent               of these spectral domains from properties of the solution, for                  example the strain field.  These numerical methods will be employed             in large scale computations to study the structure of shear bands               and factors influencing their growth.                                                                                                                           The use of spectral patches or subdomains provides a high degree                of resolution of high gradient bands.  Mappings within the                      subdomains and patches will be employed to adaptively enhance the               resolution.  These methods, because of their employment of                      subdomains, lend themselves naturally to MIMD parallel computers.               Implementations designed to exploit this parallelism, will be                   developed.                                                                                                                                                      These methods will be implemented and applied in large scale                    computational studies relating to materials forming processes.  In              particular the role of imperfections and thermal coupling in the                development of shear bands will be studied.  Additionally, these                methods will be applied in computational studies of the dynamics                of gaseous combustion with multiple stage reaction mechanisms.",
