 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change               Research Program (Our Changing Planet,\" Committee on Earth                      Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                      environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                    Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                     Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                 initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                 of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                  properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                 geospace model with predictive capability.                                           The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                             magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                   connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                   ionosphere.                                                                          This grant is designed to integrate on-going measurements of               magnetic field fluctuations at conjugate locations (Iqaluit,                    Canada, and South Pole, Antarctica) at high geomagnetic                         latitudes with other measurements to be carried out under the GEM               Program in order to obtain a more \"global\" description of the                   dayside magnetopause environment.  Of particular interest will be               the study on a \"global\" scale of magnetic impulse events, which                 appear to delineate regions of localized magnetic field-aligned                 currents.",
