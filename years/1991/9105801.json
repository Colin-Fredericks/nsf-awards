 "awd_abstract_narration": "The parvalbumins were originally identified as calcium-binding                  cytoplasmic proteins in striated muscle where they are thought to               function as calcium buffers.  The subject of this research is the               structure and function of two members of the parvalbumin family of              proteins from non-muscle tissues.  The parvalbumin, oncomodulin,                binds calcium and magnesium far less tightly than rat parvalbumin,              despite 53% sequence identity.   Production and characterization                of additional site-specific variants of oncomodulin will further                elucidate the factors responsible for ion-binding affinity in this              family of calcium binding proteins.  These results should have                  relevance not only to calcium-binding proteins, but to protein-                 ligand interactions in general.  A surprising result of prior                   studies was the finding that a molecule previously known as Avian               Thymic Hormone (ATH) is a member of the parvalbumin family,                     expressed specifically in the thymus.  Avian thymic hormone is                  believed to facilitate avian T-lymphocyte maturation, but virtually             nothing is known about its mechanism of action.  Pursuit of this                finding by identifying a receptor for ATH on bone marrow precursor              cells and/or immature lymphocytes is a second major goal of this                proposal.  Characterization of the receptor should provide insight              into the physiological significance of the parvalbumin-like thymic              hormones.  Avian thymic hormone and the muscle-associated                       parvalbumin from chicken are both expressed in a tissue-specific                manner.  Comparison of regulatory sequences in the two parvalbumin              genes and characterization of specific DNA-binding proteins should              provide insight into regulation of tissue-specific gene expression.                                                                                             Parvalbumins are calcium-binding proteins believed to function as               cytoplasmic calcium ion buffers in muscle.  There is evidence to                suggest that they play additional, possibly regulatory, roles in                non-muscle tissues.  This research is directed toward understanding             the molecular structure and cellular function of these proteins.                The results of this research will contribute new knowledge                      concerning the molecular basis for the role of calcium binding                  proteins in cellular signaling.",
