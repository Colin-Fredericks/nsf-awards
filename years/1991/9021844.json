 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Earlham College for the renovation and repair of three facilities               of the Biology Department that are devoted to field biology                     research:  the field laboratory, the greenhouse, and part of the                natural history museum, which is located in Dennis Hall.  The                   field laboratory and the greenhouse were constructed in 1968 and                the museum laboratory in 1953.  None of these buildings have been               renovated since their construction.  The ARFMP grant of $129,000                and $168,786 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used               to modernize these research and research training facilities.                   This project will address the need to improve the current                       infrastructure by providing (a) the field laboratory with room                  size and bench space enabling experiments and materials to remain               set up for longer periods of time and with better climate control               permitting its year round use; (b) the greenhouse with better                   climate control such that the plant and animal research in it will              be less vulnerable to temperature extremes; and (c) the museum                  research laboratory with structurally sound, dry space, thereby                 relieving some of the pressure that has been displaced to the field             laboratory because of the inadequacy of the museum research                     laboratory space.                                                                                                                                               This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate students.  The Biology                Department at Earlham College is nationally recognized for its                  excellence and as an important contributor to the human resources               pipeline in the biological sciences.  For many years research,                  particularly field-oriented research, has been a integral part of               its curriculum.  These renovations will help the department to                  maintain its productivity.",
