 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is integrating computer use into the intermediate                  and upper-level undergraduate physics curriculum through use of                 a local-area network.  The specific courses affected by the                     project are Intermediate Experimental Physics, Computer                         Applications to Physics Laboratories, and Computational                         Physics. However, the proposed network also provides a                          framework to later serve the undergraduate core sequence and                    newly implemented Applied Physics Program. The grant provides                   funding for a network consisting of a file server, a                            computational server, and eight relatively modest workstations                  linked by Ethernet. The computers in laboratories make                          practical the upgrading of existing experiments, the teaching                   of modern methods of computer interfacing, and the future                       introduction of contemporary new experiments into the                           undergraduate curriculum. A key component of the network is the                 computational server which provides high-performance computing                  to each network workstation. This allows undergraduate students                 to perform simulations of complex physical systems and                          processes, large-scale data analysis, and 2D and 3D graphical                   renderings for animations not feasible on modest workstations                   alone. It also enables students to develop detailed physical                    intuition not possible from hand-waving arguments that                          ordinarily are the only means to discuss these problems in                      undergraduate courses. Most significantly, the project enables                  the department to better prepare students for what is expected                  of them in graduate study, industrial positions, and secondary                  school teaching.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds                    from non-federal sources.",
