 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goals of this project are to determine the                        structure, the mechanism of transposition, and the possible                     regulatory function of Tad, a LINE-like transposable element from               Neurospora crassa.  Tad is a 7 kilobase transposable found in                   multiple copies in the Ivory Coast strain, Adiopodoume, and its                 derivatives, but not in other strains (over 400 tested).  The Tad               element has no terminal repeats, but it has internal regions of                 homology with both the gag and pol genes of retroviruses and                    retrotransposons.  The sequence of one Tad elements, which proved               to be defective, was determined. A functional Tad element has                   been cloned.  We will determine the sequence of this functional                 element and compare the sequence to other elements as well as the               nonfunctional element already sequenced.  The location of the                   major promoters will be determined using gene fusion techniques.                Cis-acting sequences important for transposition will be                        determine using engineering constructs.  An intron will also be                 introduced to determine whether Tad transposes via and RNA                      intermediate as expected from its structure.  The effects of an                 adjacent Tad element on the expression of the am gene will be                   addressed.  Tad will also be tested for mutator function, reverse               transcriptase activity, and what effects RIP has on this                        elements.",
