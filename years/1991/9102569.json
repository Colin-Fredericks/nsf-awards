This award will support a 12 month postdoctoral research                        visit by Dr. Thomas Stemann of the University of Iowa                           with Dr. Jorn Geister at the Geologisches Institut,                             Universitat Bern, Switzerland.  During the Paleogene, a                         wide variety of colonial corals of the family Agariciidae                       appeared in Europe, apparently evolving from the solitary                       coral, Trochoseris.  The colonial agariciids persisted in                       Europe through the Middle Miocene and are the ancestors                         of modern Caribbean Agariciidae.  Wide modes of colony                          growth and developmental integration mark this group.                           Dr. Stemann will study the evolutionary consequences of                         this clonal integration by investigating the origin and                         evolution of the colonial habit in the European Agaricii-                       dae.  This work will combine with his dissertation                              research on the Caribbean Agariciidae to form a comprehen-                      sive view of clonality in the family Agariciidae.  The                          study will systematically revise agariciid species and                          genera using morphometric analyses of museum specimens                          and field collections from the Northern Italian Oligocene,                      distinguishing species using cluster and discriminant                           analysis, and reconstructing the phylogeny of the                               agariciids through a cladistic analysis of micro-skeletal                       characters derived from thin-sections and SEM investiga-                        tions.  To analyze clonal development, he will measure                          zooid distribution and budding type along colony surfaces.                      He hopes to determine if the varied astogenic programs                          present in the Agariciidae are derived from separate                            aclonal ancestors or from clonal ancestors through                              extensive modification of astrogeny during the later                            evolution of the clade.  This work will be essential to                         relating the evolution of agariciid clonality to the                            paleography and climate of the Western Tethys and to the                        paleontology of Tertiary European reefs.
