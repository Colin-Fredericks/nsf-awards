 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Marvin L. Cohen,                     Professor of  Physics, University of California, Berkeley, to                   pursue with Dr. Jisoon Ihm, Professor of Physics, Seoul                         National University, and Dr. Kee Joo Chang, Professor of                        Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology                     (KAIST), for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative                    research on the electronic properties of high temperature                       superconductors.  New theoretical approaches recently have                      been developed to examine how electrons interact in solids.                     These approaches  will be applied to study electron-electron                    interactions and superconductivity, in general, with specific                   applications to the high transition temperature superconducting                 oxides.                                                                                                                                                         The field of high temperature superconductivity recently has                    attracted much attention with the discovery of high temperature                 superconductivity in oxides.  Although many mechanisms have                     been suggested to explain this phenomenon, at present there                     is no consensus regarding its basic cause.   The three                          collaborators will use a new approach to study these systems,                   with a dielectric function scheme for interactions between                      electrons and  phonons and between electrons and collective                     electronic excitations.  Each of the three scientists                           involved in this project has worked in this  field of                           research both independently and in collaboration with the PI.                   The U.S. and Korean collaborators are highly respected                          scientists who not only have extensive individual research                      records but also a record of  successful collaboration in the                   field of the proposal.  This project is relevant to the                         objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                        which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S.                   and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of                     scientific information,  ideas, skills, and techniques and                      through collaboration on problems of  mutual benefit.  Korean                   participation in the project is supported by the  Korea                         Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  The PI's primary                   research costs are supported under NSF Grant No. DMR-8818404,                   to which the present project adds an international cooperative                  dimension.",
