 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Spitkovsky will conduct research on certain topics               in operator and matrix theory in which he has been involved for the             past several years.  He will investigate problems in the following              areas: (1) factorization of sectorial matrices on non-smooth                    contours, (2) local behavior of factorization multipliers, (3)                  connections between left and right partial indices, (4)                         factorizability of piecewise-quasi-continuous matrices, (5)                     factorization of almost periodic matrices and positive extensions               of almost-periodic functions, (6) generalizations of the spectrum               assignment theorem, and (7) generalizations of the power inequality             for numerical range.                                                                 Factorization of matrix valued functions (into other matrices              with specific properties) is an important tool in many areas of                 mathematics and its applications such as systems theory,                        probability theory, and differential and integral equations.                    Professor Spitkovsky's research is basic to these areas.",
