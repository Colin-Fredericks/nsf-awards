 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal has the goal of developing a microscopic                          understanding of the underlying physical processes for particle                 emission for semiconductor and insulator surfaces when surfaces are             irradiated with a low flux pulsed UV laser beam.  The emphasis will             be focused on understanidng the role of surface defects in the                  particle emission process.  New techniques for monitoring the                   possible surface structural changes of the topmost surface layer                associated with the particle emission process will be developed.                One such technique, ion scattering spectroscopy which has extreme               surface sensitivity and can yield information not available by                  optical methods, will be explored.  An attempt will be made to                  verify the correctness of two pending models (used for                          understanding silicon and germanium results) and to point to new                directions that will enable the understanding of the underlying                 physical mechanisms.  A possible application that might result is               a means of quantifying the surface defect density by using defect-              initiated particle emission.  This work is complementary to the                 study of particle emission from metal surfaces.",
