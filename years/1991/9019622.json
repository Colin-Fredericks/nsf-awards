 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is a continuation of studies on                      somatic mutation and rapid genomic change in plants.  Work                      accomplished under that previous grant documented somatic                       variation in several plant species.  Differences in ribosomal DNA               within clones of  Solidago and somatic changes among a sexual                   progeny of Taraxacum officinale in ribosomal DNA and alcohol                    dehydrogenase were detected.  In addition, the previous work                    documented such flexible genomes within Taraxacum progeny which                 responded to environmental pressure.  Finally, techniques were                  developed for minisatellite DNA analysis of plant species and                   applied to somatic variation among apples.  The work proposed                   here will extend studies of rapid genomic change by examining                   genomic changes in heat-shock as well as ribosomal DNA genes in                 Brassica.  The effect of genomic changes on plant phenotype and                 fitness will also be determined.  Studies of somatic variation                  will continue with an analysis of minisatellite DNA variation                   within individuals of Pinus longaeva.  These proposed studies                   will provide fundamental data on the types and frequency of                     somatic genetic variation in plant populations and determine the                phenotypic and fitness consequence of such changes.  The results                of this work will provide a basis for assessing the importance of               such somatic processes for the evolution of plant species.                      Moreover, somatic variation occurs in all organisms, and has been               implicated in the normal aging process, as well as the                          development of tumors.  The proposed work will provide detailed                 information about the effect of accumulated somatic variation,                  which could be of use in studying age-dependent genetic changes                 in humans.//",
