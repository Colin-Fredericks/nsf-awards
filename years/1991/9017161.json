 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This proposal supports the collaboration of                       Drs. Saad Z. Nagi and Sharon K. Houseknecht, Ohio State                         University (OSU), and Dr. Mohamed Abdel Aal, Cairo                              University, Egypt.  The purpose of this collaboration is to                     study the influence of industrial development on social and                     economic security arrangements in Egypt.  Project funding                       will allow Dr. Houseknecht to visit study communities in                        Egypt and to participate in discussions with their leaders                      and for Dr. Aal to analyze data for a period of time at OSU                     with Drs. Houseknect and Nagi.  Dr. Nagi, as Principal                          Investigator, will provide overall project supervision.                                                                                                         Scope:  This proposal brings together research scientists                       from two countries working in the area of Egyptian                              socio-economics and culture.  It is anticipated that this                       collaborative research will result in a report on the                           influence of industrial development on social and economic                      security arrangements in Egypt.  The Egyptian scientist, Dr.                    Aal, will gain experience in the application of advanced                        statistical techniques and be exposed to sophisticated                          methods of research during his stay at OSU.  Conversely, Dr.                    Houseknecht will get an opportunity for cross-cultural                          research experience and her exchanges with Egyptian                             researchers will be highly beneficial to her future research                    and instructional endeavors.  Therefore, this proposal                          fulfills the objectives of the Science in Developing                            Countries program in its exchange and transfer of scientific                    knowledge through an international collaboration.",
