 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal presents experiments to delineawte the function                   domains of the adenoviral encoded 21 kDa E1B protein required,                  along with adenoviral E1A protein and the 55 kDa E1b protein for                cellular transformation.  Evidence suggests that this protein leads             to increase levels of another adenovirus mRNA that encodes a viral              capsid protein, polypeptide IX (pIX).  The 21 KDa E1B protein is                also known to stabilize DNA in transfected and infected cells.  The             experiments presented are designed to determine if the E1B protein              also activates gene expression using the already well studies pIX               transcription unit.  The function of the 21 kDa E1B protein during              oncogenesis is unknown and its contribution to cellular                         transformation in the presence of adenovirus encoded E1A proteins               and the 55 kDa E1B protein is also unknown  Therefore, the                      possibility that this protein activates gene expression will be                 analyzed and the role of this activity in transformation will be                examined.                                                                       The functional domains of the 21 kDa E1B protein will be mapped                 using deletional analysis and examines for activation of pIX gene               expression in transient expression assays.  The pIX promoter region             will be altered to test for activation by the E1B protein.m  If                 confirmation of pIX gene activation by E1B protein is obtained and              a specific domain of the E1B protein that mediates this activity is             identified, then this domain will also be tested for DNA                        stabilization property and transforming ability using appropriate               viral constructs.                                                               The possible affects of the 21 kDa E1B protein on the retention of              proteins bound to the pIX promoter will be examines using gel                   retardation assays.  Extracts from uninfected and infected cells                will be compared for differences in retardation of a DNA fragment               containing the pIX  promoter region.  Identification of the                     proteins involved in retarding the pIX promoter DNA will be                     performed using competing oligonucleotide containing the already                identified pIX promoter elements.                                               The ultimate goal is to determine if E1B protein does activate gene             expression, if this activity correlates will transforming activity.             These analyses will provide the foundation for extended analyses of             the mechanism by which E1B protein activates pIX gene expression in             a system defined in vitro.  This research may apply to the means by             which the 21 kDa E1B protein participates in cellular                           transformation.",
