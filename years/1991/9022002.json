 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen fills the interstellar medium of our Galaxy.  While some               of this hydrogen is hot, and completely ionized, radio observations             at a wavelength of 21~cm find a sky filled with signals from cold               ,neutral hydrogen. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research award              will allow Dr. Verschuur to observe interstellar neutral hydrogen               at high spatial resolution. Using the Zeeman effect, he will                    easure the magnetic fields in regions of enhanced 21~cm emission.               He expects to see the magnetic field reverse sign in a manner                   consistent with the idea that the emission derives from a ``tube\"               of hydrogen that has coupled to a strong magnetic field.                                                                                                        Dr. Verschuur understands the problems with interpreting a signal               projected from a three-dimensional volume onto a two-dimensional                surface. He feels that the signals that have led to a description               of interstellar hydrogen as ``clouds,\" suggesting a roundish,                   3-dimensional structure, have been incorrectly interpreted and that             these signals instead originate from a linear structure twisting                in the magnetic field of the Galaxy. These observations will,                   first, provide more values for the magnetic field strength and its              variation in the Galaxy.  Most importantly, they will lead to an                improved understanding of the morphology of hydrogen in the                     interstellar medium.",
