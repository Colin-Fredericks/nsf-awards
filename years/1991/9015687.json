 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two year cooperative research                         project involving Professor Stephen Benkovic, Department of                     Chemistry, Pennsylvania State University, and Professor Eiko                    Ohtsuka, Hokkaido University, Japan. The objective of the                       collaboration is to develop catalytic antibodies that                           promote amide synthesis and transesterification of phosphodi-                   esters in RNA structures. This research will exploit two                        recent scientific advances in this area, namely (1) the                         production of antibodies that resemble the transition state                     of a given reaction which catalyze the synthesis or breakage                    of chemical bonds with substantial rate accelerations and with                  exquisite specificity; and (2) the demonstration that such                      monoclonal antibodies can be constructed in bacteria. These                     advances open the way for constructing a library consisting                     of several million FAB fragments, screened for binding and                      tested for catalytic activity.  Additionally, the production                    of gram quantities of a desired antibody can now be carried out                 on a cost efficient basis using fermentation.  It is hoped,                     as a result of this research, to develop catalysts which will                   be useful in understanding the mode of action of ribozymes,                     the RNA cleaving enzymes, as well as developing superior                        means of constructing amide bonds expediting the synthesis of                   hormonally active peptides.                                                                                                                                     Both collaborating researchers are highly competent scientists                  with distinguished accomplishments, and each is considered an                   expert in his individual field. Their strengths are compleme-                   ntary; Professor Benkovic will concentrate on the mechanism                     of catalysis and Professor Ohtsuka on the structural properties                 of 2D NMR.  Any advances in this area will have significant                     benefits, both scientific and industrial.  If this project is                   successful it should have a major impact on modern biology.",
