 "awd_abstract_narration": "A basic feature of all predator-prey interactions is the trade-                 off between predator ability to locate prey and prey ability to                 avoid predators.  Spiders that weave aerial webs and their insect               prey are an ideal system for exploring this trade-off.  A web,                  the physical manifestation of the foraging mode of a predator,                  can be manipulated and the response of the prey can be                          quantified.  Moreover, while most studies on predator-prey                      interactions focus on the effect of predators on prey                           populations, studies on spiders and insects should yield insight                into mechanisms of co-evolution.                                                                                                                                Dr. Craig's research is designed to show how the avoidance                      behavior of prey may affect the foraging modes of a predator.                   Specifically, she asks (1) if the ability of insects to learn and               remember web locations is inhibited by the day-to-day variation                 in the web decorations spun by a species of tropical spider, (2)                if color and design of the decorations are equally important in                 attracting prey, and (3) if stingless bees that have learned to                 avoid one type of spider web are able to recognize and avoid webs               spun by other spider species that differ in architecture but are                spun from silks with similar spectral properties.                                                                                                               This research will take an initial step in studying the                         perceptual capabilities and behaviors of insects that may have                  affected the evolution of the aerial-web-weaving foraging mode.                 The results will be of general interest to investigators studying               insect perception, learning, and foraging behavior and to those                 interested in the evolution of predator-prey interactions.",
