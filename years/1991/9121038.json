 "awd_abstract_narration": "The contractor will carry out the 1992 Survey of Academic                  Research Facilities, a sample survey of higher education                        institutions that collects data on the status and condition of                  science and engineering research facilities.  A \"Quick Response                 Survey\" was conducted in 1986 followed by a more detailed full                  scale facilities survey in 1988.  A followup to the 1988 survey                 was conducted in 1990.  Tasks involved in the 1992 survey will                  include conduct of data collection activities, tabulation of data               results, provision of technical support as required for the                     National Science Foundation's own analytical uses of the data,                  and production of a final analytical report summarizing the                     results of the study, for submission to Congress in September                   1992.  A second analytical report on the biomedical sciences will               be prepared for the National Institutes of Health, co-sponsors of               the study.                                                                           The Authorization Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-159) directed                 NSF to \"...design, establish, and maintain a data collection and                analysis capability in the Foundation for the purpose of                        identifying and assessing research facilities needs of                          universities.\"  This study, initiated in response to the above                  mandate, provides quantitative and qualitative information on the               amount, cost, and condition of existing research facilities as                  well as current and planned construction and repair/renovation                  activities, including the sources of funding for these capital                  projects.",
