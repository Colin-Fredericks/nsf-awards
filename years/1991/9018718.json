 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the exception of plasmid copy control, the mechanisms                      regulating initiation of DNA replication are still to be defined.               The goal of this proposal is to understand how initiation of DNA                replication is regulated by cis-acting elements that are located                outside of the origin of replication.  The present studies will                 focus on cmp, a cis-acting enhancer of plasmid replication which                is located about 1 Kilobase away from the plasmid's origin of                   replication.  The effects of cmp on plasmid replication (                       demonstrated by plasmid competition studies and by analysis of                  exponential replication rates) appear to derive from a change in                the efficiency with which the plasmids's replication origin                     interacts with its initiator protein.  cmp activity is                          orientation-independent and can be detected over a wide range of                distances from the origin.  cmp is recognized by a site-specific                DNA-binding protein 9CBF) encoded by the bacterial host.  The                   goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanism by               which cmp enhances plasmid replication and to define the role of                host factors in cmp enhancing activity.  To achieve this goal,                  genetic and biochemical studies willbe performed, often in                      parallel.  Deletion analysis of cmp DNA will define the minimal                 sequence for cmp and the DNA site for CBF binding within cmp will               be identified by footprinting.  In vivo, cmp activity will be                   studied using a replication assay; footprinting and nicking                     assays will define the effect of cmp on the interaction between                 replication origin and initiator protein.  The role of CBF will                 be studied by inactivating the gene encoding CBF and determining                the effect of the mutation on plasmid replication.  Purified CBF                protein will be obtained to design appropriate probes to screen a               library of bacterial chromosomal DNA.  Host involvement will be                 also investigated by isolating host mutants that suppress the                   plasmid's Cmp defect.  The regulatory interaction between cmp and               ori may be mediated by a protein-protein bridge involving CBF and               the initiator protein, with the intervening DNA looping out.                    Formation of such a protein complex will be investigated by                     chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques, and the                         configuration of the protein-bond plasmid molecules will be                     examined by electron microscopy.  Interactions between cmp and                  other cis-acting elements in the plasmid and/or other plasmid                   encoded factors will also be addressed by genetic studies                       involving isolation of plasmid-linked second-site mutations that                suppress the Cmp-phenotype.  A knowledge of the loaf-range                      regulatory interactions in the activity of cmp will contribute to               our understanding of how initiation of DNA replication is                       regulated by cis-acting elements distantly located from the                     origin of replication. cmp will provide a novel model system to                 investigate \"action at a distance (along DNA)\" in general",
