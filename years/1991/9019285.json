 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal project addresses the role of the plant cytoskeleton              during plant development, with emphasis on the reorganization of                microtubule arrays during the life of a cell.  Attention will be                focussed on a system found to be advantageous in prior studies, the             dividing generative cell of Tradescantia, which features what                   appears to be reutilization of Mts in different arrays.  The                    questions to be addressed include the mechanism governing                       conversion of interphase microtubule bundles into kinetochore                   fibers, the manner in which kinetochore fibers and surrounding                  microtubules are reorganized into large superbundles during                     anaphase, the role of this reorganization in chromosome motion, the             mechanism governing constriction cytokinesis, and the role of                   chromosome volume and physical constraints in the architecture of               the division apparatus.  Principal approaches include                           immunofluorescence techniques, conventional and confocal laser                  scanning microscopy, electron microscopy, analyses of proteins in               isolated generative cells, and the use of related species of                    different ploidy levels.                                                                                                                                        The long term goal of this work is to understand the mechanisms                 governing reorganization of microtubules in plant cells.                        Microtubules are important and dynamic structural elements in all               eukaryotic cells, and are known to play significant roles in the                development and maintenance of cell shape, intracellular movement               of subcellular particles, and in the segregation of chromosomes                 during cell division.",
