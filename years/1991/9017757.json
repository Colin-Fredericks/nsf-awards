 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will examine neurohormone synthesis and                   secretion in insects using the hypertrehalosemic hormone (HTH) as               the model.  HTH belongs to the adipokinetic/red pigment-                        concentrating hormone family that is widespread among insects.                  These hormones all stimulate mobilization of fat body nutrient                  stores to elevate circulating metabolites for energy. HTH also                  stimulates heme synthesis during fat body mitochondrial maturation              and acts synergistically with juvenile hormone to enhance protein               synthesis.  Hence, HTH is critical for regulating insect basal                  metabolism through effects on energy production/consumption.                    Measurements of HTH synthesis-secretion will be made by incubating              corpora cardiaca with \u01313H!tryptophan and determine the amount of                \u01313H!HTH formed using reversed-phase chromatography and scintillation            spectrometry.  The research will examine HTH synthesis-secretion                relative to a series of physiological variables that include: age,              sex, circadian rhythms, feeding, endocrine titers and effects by                other parts of the nervous system.  This research will provide a                base of data for future investigations into how physiological                   effectors control neurohormone gene expression in higher animals.                                                                                                                                                                               Physiological changes in response to environmental changes in                   animals are mediated by the nervous system and, in turn, by                     neurohormones, peptide hormones that are produced and secreted by               the nervous system.  This proposal describes studies on one such                neurohormone, the hypertrehalosemic hormone (HTH) of the cockroach              Blaberus discoidalis, a hormone involved in the mobilization of                 energy reserves from the fat body of the insect.  The project will              isolate the gene encoding HTH, and will study the physiological                 regulation of HTH synthesis at the gene level.  The results should              provide basic information about the role of neurohormones in                    controlling physiological responses to environmental stimuli.  Such             basic information may also be useful in future applications in the              area of insect pest control.//",
