Darensbourg of the Chemistry                 Department, Texas A&M University, for fundamental work on the                   chemistry of transition metal complexes containing both                         hydrogen and sulfur-containing ligands.  The goal of the                        research is to find direct evidence for some of the individual                  steps in S-H, C-S and C-H activation by nickel, iron, and                       cobalt.  Specifically Darensbourg plans to investigate the                      mechanism of four types of reactions: metal hydrides with                       organosulfur reagents; dihydrogen release from hydrido-thiolate                 complexes of iron and nickel; oxidation-reduction of                            sulfur-bound nickel complexes with various ligand environments;                 and transition metal promoted heterolysis of metal-proximate                    C-H bonds.  In the studies of sulfur-bound nickel complexes,                    dependence of the oxidation potential and of the oxidative                      addition of hydrogen on the presence of sulfur and phosphorus                   ligands will be investigated.                                                   %%%                                                                             The results of these experiments are relevant to the action of                  hydrogenase enzymes in methanogenic bacteria and heterogeneous                  hydrodesulfurization catalysts, in which reaction mechanisms                    involving simultaneous bonding of sulfur and hydrogen have been                 proposed.",
