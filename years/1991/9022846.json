 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objective of this project is to enhance                        understanding of the development of precipitation and                           electrification, as well as the association between the two, in                 warm-based clouds where \"warm rain\" processes, including                        coalescence-freezing, are active.  The work involves study of the               cloud microphysical, kinematic, and electrical characteristics                  using data collected with the armored T-28 meteorological                       research aircraft, in conjunction with data gathered by other                   aircraft, radars, and additional observing systems.  The T-28                   will probe the interiors of mature convective storms to obtain in               situ information on winds, sub-cloud-scale dynamical structures,                temperatures, microphysical properties, and the electric field                  structure.                                                                                                                                                           Electric field measurements made by the T-28 will be                       combined with surface field and lightning location measurements,                as well as measurements from other aircraft and vertical                        electrical soundings, to help deduce the charge distribution in                 the storms, its evolution with time, and how it may be influenced               by microphysical and dynamical charge separation mechanisms.",
