 "awd_abstract_narration": "The possibility of climatic warming in high-latitude zones has             fueled growing concern about prospects for widespread melting of                permafrost across large areas of the Arctic.  The dynamics by which             permafrost melts are not fully understood, however.  Longstanding views         that held conductive heat transfer as the primary mechanism have been           challenged by new theories that hold that nonconductive heat transfer           also plays an important role in the freezing and thawing of permafrost.         This project will assess the degree to which each of these mechanisms           and other possible processes affects permafrost dynamics in a variety           of settings in central Alaska.  Measurements of a variety of different          soil, snow and ice, temperature, and moisture conditions will be                collected at a set of paired permafrost and non-permafrost sites.               These data will be used to analyze relationships among these different          variables and to test different models of heat transfer within                  permafrost.                                                                          This project will provide valuable new data on conditions within           and immediately above the soil in permafrost and non-permafrost                 regions, and it will provide an effective test of competing hypotheses          regarding heat transfer mechanisms that affect the stability of                 permafrost.  In addition to contributing to new insights about                  permafrost dynamics, this project also will make methodological                 contributions by testing the efficacy of new instruments in harsh               environments.",
