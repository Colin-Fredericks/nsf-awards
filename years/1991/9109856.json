 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the role of attention in                         controlling and overcoming conflict engendered by automatic                     processing of irrelevant information.  Conflict from automatic                  processing is apparent in real-world situations in which our                    current goals run counter to established habits, such as                        departing from the usual route home to stop at the store.  The                  Stroop task provides a laboratory example:  People are asked to                 name the color in which words are presented and must overcome the               automatic reading response when the word itself names a                         conflicting color (e.g., RED written in green).  Performance on                 the Stroop task and its many variations (e.g., deciding whether 3               + 4 = 12 is true) provides a major data base which theories of                  attention and automaticity must explain.  This research will                    apply Logan's instance theory of automaticity, developed to                     account for skill acquisition, to conflict paradigms.                                                                                                           The instance theory assumes that novice performance is based on a               general algorithm for performing the task and that, with                        practice, the algorithm is gradually replaced by memory for                     specific solutions.  This learning process is modeled in the                    theory in a precise mathematical fashion.  The instance theory                  accounts for learning better than other theories of skill                       acquisition because it accounts for changes in the entire                       distribution of reaction times, not just average performance.                                                                                                   As it stands, the instance theory makes incorrect predictions in                conflict paradigms, predicting no slowing of reaction time and an               error rate close to 100%, in contrast to vast numbers of                        experiments which show a substantial slowing in reaction time and               a slight increase in error rate.  This research will develop the                theory to overcome this problem and then test the new                           developments.  Theory development will involve assuming two                     different representations, a perceptual representation and a                    conceptual representation, that are bound together by the process               of attention.                                                                                                                                                   The research will involve three series of experiments.  The first               will examine the process that binds perceptual representations to               conceptual representations; the second will separate perceptual                 and conceptual representations; and the third will examine long-                term consequences of the binding process by examining learning                  effects.  The research will investigate the binding process                     theoretically using computer simulations of the learning process                that compare the instance theory with other current theories of                 skill acquisition.",
