 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists have long been interested in the factors responsible                 for the evolution of differences in the sexes.  Knowledge of such               mechanisms of evolution within species also provides insight                    into the divergence of species which in turn contributes to our                 understanding of the diversification of life.  This project will                study the evolution of sex differences in chaenopsid fishes, a                  group of tropical marine blennioid fishes.  Prior research on the               genus Coralliozetus has revealed that many of the differences in                males and females evolved in a single event in which the                        development of females became truncated.  Similar changes in the                timing of development are known for other organisms, yet have                   rarely been implicated in the divergence of the sexes.  The                     precise developmental mechanisms responsible for this divergence,               whether a slowing or an early cessation of development in                       females, will be determined by describing the development in both               sexes of these and related species.  The role of this                           morphological change in the ecology of these fishes will be                     studied by testing a hypothesized behavioral shift in habitat use               of females.  Habitat shifts by one sex are poorly documented and                represent an important, but recently overlooked, cause for the                  evolution of sex differences.  The generality of these results                  will be tested in a similar study on the equally dimorphic                      chaenopsid genus Emblemaria.  This research is unique in                        integrating systematics, developmental biology and behavioral                   ecology in the study of sex differences.",
