Small islands are used as a model system, because they are                      numerous, simple, discrete and have species and trophic types in                                                                                                various combinations.  How top predators affect intermediate                    predators, ambient insects and foliage damage is studied in an                  introduction experiment of lizards onto small islets.  The same                 phenomena, plus the degree to which intermediate predators                      compensate in top-predator absence, is studied in a lizard/spider                                                                                               removal experiment in large enclosures.  A second experiment will                                                                                               measure spider competition with and without lizards.  Natural                   extinction is studied using a system of over 100 islands; we                    focus on the effect of top predators on spider extinction rate,                 and on how extinction rate varies with mean, variability and                    skewness of population-size values over time and with life-                     history characteristics.  Spatial patchiness in spider population                                                                                               distributions will be studied both between islands and within                                                                                                   larger islands; the latter will be related to top predator                                                                                                      occurrence and density.
