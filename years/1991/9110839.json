 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel computation has the potential for accelerating the solution            of combinatorial search problems.  Universal randomized methods, with           provably effective speed-up, have already been developed for parallel           backtrack search and parallel branch-and-bound computation.  Also               previously developed was a paradigm for parallelizing the sequential            alpha-beta pruning algorithm and its variants for evaluating game               trees.                                                                          This project continues work on the theory of parallel search                    algorithms, with the following objectives.  First, the performance of           the randomized methods will be analyzed for hypercube and butterfly             networks.  This analysis will demonstrate the effectiveness of the              algorithms in practice.  Second, network routing methods in which               messages are issued periodically and asynchronously will be studied,            since these methods provide a mechanism for implementing backtrack              search on networks.  Third, a new type of probabilistic performance             analysis, competitive analysis, will be applied to parallel                     algorithms.  Finally, experimental work on the proposed algorithms              will provide insight for the theoretical investigations.",
