 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose a biological instrumentation development program aimed               at a radical upgrade of the mass discrimination capability and                  secondary ion detection sensitivity of the University of Chicago                high resolution Scanning Ion Microprobe (UC SIM).  This is to be                accomplished by replacing the existing RF quadrupole mass filter                with a high performance magnetic sector mass spectrometer.  The                 design and construction of appropriate transfer optics, and                     modification to the present secondary ion extraction system,                    together with high voltage and hardware construction, will be                   required to implement this goal.  The pursuit of fundamental                    biological studies at a much improved level of performance with                 this instrument, that has already contributed substantial                       advances in many areas that benefit from imaging microanalysis,                 justifies the proposed upgrade.                                                                                                                                 Established biologists from several academic institutions will                  collaborate with us in exciting applications of the upgraded                    microprobe, in all cases continuation and amplification of                      successful pilot experiments already carried out with the UC SIM.                                                                                                                                                                               These applications will aim at:                                                                                                                                      (a) Director mapping of the distribution of isotope-labelled                        nucleotides in human chromosomes and evaluation of the                          nucleotide content of fragile sites.                                        (b) Identification of the mineral phases involved in bone                           formation and of the mechanism of bone resorption                               initiated by osteoclasts.  This will entail experiments                         with Ca isotopes as tracers, and the detection and                              measurement of phosphorus.                                                  (c) Localization and kinetics of trace elements in tooth and                        bone tissues, relative to microstructure.                                       Microstructural study of organs (bone, brain) affected                          by aluminum.                                                                (d) Study of the role of calcium in neuronal ischemia using                         retinal neurons as model system.  These studies will                            make use of Ca isotopes and isotope-labelled                                    nucleotides as tracers.",
