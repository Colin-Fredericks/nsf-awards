 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will study                      several problems associated with singular integrals and Fourier                 integrals.  In particular, he will formulate classes of canonical               relations that apply to examples from integral geometry and                     isospectral deformations, and he will prove composition calculi                 and sharp L-2 estimates for Fourier integral operators associated               with them.  The principal investigator will also look into the                  local solvability of systems of first-order pseudodifferential                  operators.  Finally he will obtain sharper estimates for                        degenerate pseudodifferential operators with singular symbols,                  and he will apply these results to degenerate Radon transforms.                      A number of problems in theoretical and applied analysis                   concern the inversion of an operation or a transformation.  For                 example, the desired solution of a problem may be transformed                   into an equation that involves integrals or integral operators,                 and then in order to obtain the solution, one must invert the                   transformation, that is, solve the integral equation.  In this                  project the principal investigator will analyze two classes of                  integral operators, in order to provide sharp estimates for the                 solutions they represent.  One application of this work is to the               estimation of solutions of X-ray tomography problems.",
