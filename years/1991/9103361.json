 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electric power is an important factor in the Nation's                      competitiveness.  Research on the industrial use of electric power              and instrumentation will benefit a very large cross section of                  industries.  This planning grant will study the potential for                   forming an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                  Electric Power and Instrumentation at the University of New                     Orleans.                                                                             This planning grant is studying the research, organization and             policies, as well as the potential for industry support for an                  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Electric Power              and Instrumentation at the University of New Orleans.                                The Principal Investigator is qualified and has the resources              to undertake this planning grant.                                                    The project has been coordinated with Dr. Kevin Clements,                  Program Director, Power Systems.                                                     The Program Manager recommends the University of New Orleans               be awarded $25,000 for one (1) year for this planning grant.",
