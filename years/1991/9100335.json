 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this grant, the University of Rhode Island will carry                out its first, in a series, major initiatives in educational                    outreach related to the science and social science aspects of                   global environmental change through the mechanism of an Honor's                 Colloquium for the spring semester 1991.  The Honor's Colloquium                is a combination of public outreach, in the form of Wednesday                   evening public lectures and a complementary undergraduate course                for freshman and sophomore Honor's students.  The University of                 Rhode Island will bring world-renown educators and scientists to                the campus during the spring 1991 for the Wednesday evening                     lectures.  They will videotape the evening lectures for long-term               educational prospects in the form of additional-to-offered-                     courses and the development of a new course for the distance-                   learning market.  The invited speaker presentations will be                     published and available along with curriculum materials and                     readings to other interested educational institutions and public                groups through a number of networks and mechanisms.  A                          Colloquium volume will be  produced through the Marine Technology               Society through a special issue of the Marine Technology Society                Journal.  This activity is important because it seeks to increase               the pool of qualified students entering the environmental                       sciences.",
