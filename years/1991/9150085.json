 "awd_abstract_narration": "Activities that encourage middle school students to learn                       the concepts of science and mathematics by motivating them                      with real world situations or interest to them are to                           developed by technology education community.  The activities                    will use design under constraint - hands-on technology - (as                    different from hands-on science) to motivate the learning of                    science and mathematics.  The results will include the                          increased ability of students to apply concepts of science                      and mathematics to \"real-world\" situations, increased                           communications among science, mathematics and technology                        teachers and research findings on the role and effectiveness                    of technology-based activities.  The project uses teams of                      teachers to produce materials under the guidance of the                         principal investigators and science and mathematics                             educators.  Administrators will be part of the team to help                     work out logistical problems.  The materials will be                            disseminated by a commercial publisher.",
