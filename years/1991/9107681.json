 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research should make valuable methodological and substantive               contributions to our understanding of dynamics of economic                      growth, consumption, saving and other important economic                        variables.  The project pursues research on learning in economic                systems; recursive dynamic models of economic fluctuations; and                 monetary history.  The two lines of research on learning are                    artificial intelligent learning via classifier systems and                      learning via recursive ARMA models.  Two classes of recursive                   dynamic models are considered, one with \"signalling \" within                    incomplete markets and another with complete markets.  Two areas                of monetary history are examined: the macroeconomics of the                     periods preceding, during, and following the French revolution                  and government switches from one commodity money standard to                    another.                                                                                                                                                        Models in game theory and macroeconomics often have multiple                    equilibria, and there is no self-evident way for either agents                  inside the model or economists to select among them.  In monetary               economics, there are a variety models that display such                         multiplicities.  The research by this project on learning                       algorithms is very important because it provides means of                       reducing the number of possible outcomes in some cases to a                     single rational equilibrium.  The predictions of that model can                 then be tested empirically.                                                                                                                                     Dynamic stochastic models are used in macroeconomics and finance                to build theories about how variables like consumption and                      interest rates covary over time.  But these models are often                    computationally demanding to analyze or completely intractable.                 The research on recursive dynamic models explores ways that these               models can be quickly and inexpensively formulated and solved.                                                                                                  Economic history provides a laboratory within which recent                      developments in macroeconomic theory can be tested.  The                        investigator has turned up a number of documents that show the                  seriousness with which leaders of France around the time of the                 French Revolution were experimenting with a range of arrangements               extending from \"real bills\" schemes to \"optimal tax smoothing\"                  policies.  This project will use dynamic macroeconomic and                      monetary theories to study these and other historical episodes.",
