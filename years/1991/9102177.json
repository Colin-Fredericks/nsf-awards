 "awd_abstract_narration": "Realistic characterization and understanding of the mechanical             response of materials and interfaces in semiconductor devices such              as chip-substrate and packaging are vital for improved and                      competitive designs in manufacturing.  Most of the previously used              constitutive models do not account for important factors such as                inelastic response, fracture, damage, delamination and degradation              under thermomechanical and viscous (creep) effects, in an                       integrated manner.  The objective of the research is to develop a               unified modeling approach that will allow incorporation of the                  above factors in the behavior of both solid materials and                       interfaces in the semiconductor devices.  The models thus developed             will be verified with respect to available test results from                    laboratory measurements.                                                             Semiconductor devices are extremely complex systems, often                 involving interfaces between brittle and ductile materials.                     Because of the complexity of the system, failures are hard to                   predict and, therefore, failure-resistant designs are difficult to              achieve.  The reseach work will develop a much more sophisticated               approach to the design of semiconductor devices and packaging than              those which are currently available.",
