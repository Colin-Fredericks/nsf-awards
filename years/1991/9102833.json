 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maturation of most eukaryotic mRNAs involves RNA splcing.                       Therefore, understanding of mechanism of RNA splcing is central to              understanding gene expression.  Maturation of some mRNAs in C.                  elegans (involves the acquisition of one of two spliced leaders                 through tran-splcing.  The two spliced leaders are specifically                 trans-spliced to different mRNAs and the reaction is very specific.             Therefore, understanding the mechanism of trans-splicing is central             to understanding gene expression in C. elegans.  The working                    hypothesis of this proposal can be stated as follows:  There are                different classes of trans-spliceosomes in C. elegans with the                  difference being the presence of SL1 snRNP or SL2 snRNP.  In                    addition, trans-splicing and cis-splicing in C. elegans occur on                separate classes of spliceosomes.  The difference between these                 classes is the presence of SL snRNP in trans-spliceosomes and U1                snRNP in cis-spliceosomes.  Other snRNPs are common to both classes             of spliceosomes.                                                                                                                                                Using a molecular genetic approach,  the PI will investigate two                key questions concerning the mechanism of RNA splicing in C.                    elegans.  What nucleotides of SL RNAs are important in determing                specificity during trans-splicing and is trans-splicing independent             of U1 of snRNP?",
