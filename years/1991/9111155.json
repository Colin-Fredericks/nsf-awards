The                      purpose of the planning grant is two-fold.  It will support                     background work on the phonetics and phonology of voicing,                      increased familiarity with the literature, exploration of                       possible phonetic methodologies, and consultation with expert                   researchers.  The second aspect of the plan is to conduct                       preliminary research on three topics concerning different aspects               of voicing and related features.  These include a study of                      sonorant voicing and devoicing in English, a cross-linguistic                   study of the status of \"voiceless\" nasals, and fieldwork and                    phonetic investigation of Madurese, an Austronesian language                    spoken in Indonesia.  The completion of these planning activities               and preliminary studies will enable the Principal Investigator to               address broader questions related to phonetic and phonological                  issues of voicing with the purpose of developing a more                         comprehensive research proposal on the subject.",
