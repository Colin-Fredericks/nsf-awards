 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital replication is a new, rapid reverse engineering                    process for making highly detailed three dimensional electronic                 models of physical objects through the use of X-Ray Computerized                Tomography (CT) scanning.  With current industrial CT technology,               Digital Replica of small objects (24 in3) can be generated in a few             hours.  The resulting surface model is accurate and captures all                part details, but it is not compatible with conventional computer               aided design (CAD) modeling systems.  The main objective of this                project is to develop CAD interfaces to organize the surface data               points into a more structured curve and surface representation,                 such as the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) form, which can               be converted into standard CAD data exchange formats, such as IGES,             and PDES standards.                                                                  The system will provide a means to rapidly generate CAD models             from existing parts for which CAD data is missing or  incomplete.               In addition to the analytic representation for curve and surface,               the solid model requires the establishment of higher level                      geometrical and topological features for describing both                        external and internal structural shapes of the solid object.                    Features such as holes, slots or pockets, that may be easily                    identified in both inspection and manufacturing processes will be               used.",
