 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past ten years there has been a close symbiotic                 relationship between the areas of probability in Banach Spaces and              modern empirical process theory, with the main ideas from one                   having one or more useful analogues in the other.  The conference               which this grant will support is divided into two one-week                      sessions.  The first, devoted to probability in separable Banach                spaces, will cover such topics as new finite-dimensional limit                  theorems, new infinite-dimensional limit theorems, proofs of                    probabilistic theorems in Banach spaces and applications of these               results to analysis and random sets.  The second week, devoted to               empirical process theory, will cover new work on Vapnik-Cervonenkis             combinatorics, entropy conditions, non-linear functionals and other             statistical aspects.                                                                 This conference will be held July 7-20 at Bowdoin College.                 Each week of the conference will be composed of a minicourse and                individual lectures on recent results.  This will provide an                    excellent atmosphere for analysts, probabilists and statisticians               from these two overlapping fields to interact.",
