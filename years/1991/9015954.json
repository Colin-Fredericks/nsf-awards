 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between US and                   French scientists on the topic of the air-snow transfer                         function in Greenland.  The participants are: Drs. Jean-                        Luc Jaffrezo, Cliff Davidson and Jack Dibb, Carnegie Mellon                     University, and Dr. Michel Legrand, Laboratoire de Glaciologie                  et Geophysique de l'Environment, St. Martin d'Here, France.                                                                                                     The US (GISP II) and European (GRIP) deep drilling projects                     involve acquisition of two deep cores to bedrock from the                       Summit region of Greenland over the next two years.  The                        cores will provide a detailed record of about 200,000 years,                    yielding information on the earth's geologic history, climate                   change and variations in the chemical composition of                            atmospheric constituents.  One important component of the                       GISP II and GRIP projects is a program in atmospheric                           sciences, which is designed to help relate the ice core data                    to atmospheric conditions in previous times.  There are three                   objectives to this program:  1) Source regions and atmospheric                  pathways for the chemical constituents reaching the Summit                      will be identified; 2) Incorporation of these species into                      precipitation at the Summit will be investigated, in order to                   determine the mechanisms and rates of deposition during                         snowstorms; and 3) Changes in the chemical composition of the                   icesheet will be quantified.  These objectives will be                          achieved by a multicomponent program that incorporates field                    work, laboratory analyses, and computer modelling. This award                   will support collaboration between US and French researchers                    for the purpose of carrying out laboratory work, data                           interpretation and joint publications related to the above                      projects.  This effort will benefit from the complementary                      expertise of the US and French teams in the geochemistry of                     gases and aerosols, of tracers of natural and anthropogenic                     emissions and of transport and deposition mechanisms.  The                      results of this research are expected to improve greatly the                    ability of the scientific community to retrieve information                     from deep ice.",
