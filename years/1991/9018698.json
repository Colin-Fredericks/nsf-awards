 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symbiotic associations are common in our environment and, may be                extremely important to the success of both plant and animal                     species.   Some of the most interesting are found in the coral                  reef environment and involve an algal symbiont known as                         zooxanthellae and various invertebrate hosts.  Coral reefs                      constitute a major ecosystem that is dependent on algal                         symbiosis.  Global warming is thought to cause bleaching in coral               symbionts and this inhibits reproduction of coral.  An                          understanding of the relationship between symbiosis and                         reproduction in host organisms is essential to the understanding                of symbiotic ecosystems.                                                                                                                                        Algal symbionts form the basis for much of the reef's primary                   productivity since they convert carbon dioxide and other                        inorganic compounds into organic substances that can be utilized                by host species.  A high diversity of species may be supported in               large numbers in the reef environment.  Perhaps the most                        important, unasked, question about zooxanthellae symbiosis is:                  \"What effects do symbiotic zooxanthellae have on the reproductive               success of their invertebrate hosts?\"  The species to be used is                Berghia verrucicornis, a marine slug.  This species has a number                of characteristics that make it particularly useful for studying                the reproductive ramifications of zooxanthealle symbiosis.  These               include (1) its own zooxanthellae symbiosis, (2) its ease of                    culture in the lab, and (3) the fact that it lays discrete,                     easily collected egg masses.  This project will utilize                         biochemical analyses, radioisotopes, and energetic analysis to                  determine what portion of the organic materials produced by                     zooxanthellae are incorporated into the eggs of Berghia                         verrucicornis.  The results and conclusions derived from this                   research will provide for a better understanding of the role of                 zooxanthellae in the reproduction and success of reef-dwelling                  species that harbor these symbionts in their tissues.//",
