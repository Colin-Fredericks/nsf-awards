 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies changes in family and household ideology,                  organization and practices in the lower and middle classes of two               cities in Latin America, one in Argentina and one in Mexico.  At                the present time Mexico is apparently recovering from a                         depression of 8 years, while Argentina is entering a new, more                  drastic stage of economic problems.  The project will examine the               survival strategies of households in two cities, looking at the                 internal organization of the households, how they manage their                  funds, investments, and time, and how they deal with changes in                 the labor market.  The project will examine how people represent                their household responsibilities to themselves and to others, and               how they understand local, regional, national, and international                economic changes.  Methods include surveys, intensive interviews                and participant observation, in collaboration with Argentinean                  and Mexican social scientists.                                                                                                                                  This research is important because Latin America has undergone                  severe economic stress, and will continue to do so for the near                 future, at the same time that its population has become                         increasingly urban.  Anthropological research has established the               profound importance of the household in understanding how people                cope with difficulties.  This project will add to our knowledge                 by comparing similar households in countries at different stages                of economic development.  The ultimate goal is to construct a                   folk theory of labor economics and the international system, in                 order to understand how Latin Americans understand their economic               plight.  This sort of information will be important to policy                   makers in assessing the impact of different international                       policies on the urban population.",
