 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fatty acid biosynthesis in plants is a primary metabolic pathway                that is necessary to provide the fatty acyl components found in the             lipids of membranes and vegetable oils.  The initial sequence of                reaction for this pathway are under reevaluation since a new                    condensing enzyme, 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (KAS III), was                    discovered in spinach.  KAS III has properties in vitro that are                consistent with it being the enzyme that catalyzes the initial                  priming reaction of fatty acid synthesis.  The objective of this                proposal is to obtain in vivo evidence that it is an essential                  component of fatty acid synthesis and normally acts to catalyze the             initial condensation.  In addition, the metabolic role of acetyl-               CoA-ACP transacylase and KAS I will be reevaluated.  Previously,                these two enzymes were thought to initiate fatty acid synthesis.                                                                                                The biochemical characterization of KAS III to be completed                     includes substrate specificity and level of acetyl-CoA-ACP                      transacylase activity copurifying with KAS III.  The effects on                 rates of, and regulation of fatty acid synthesis will be evaluated.             IN addition, the in vivo role of KAS III and acetyl-CoA-ACP                     transacylase will be evaluated using isolated chloroplasts.  The                results of this proposal should help to determine the initial steps             of fatty acid biosynthesis in plants.//",
