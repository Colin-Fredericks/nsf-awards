 "awd_abstract_narration": "The participation of vinyl isocyanates as 4-electron partners                   in various cyclocondensation reactions will be studied in order                 to extend the reactivity profile of these interesting reagents.                 The program will focus on novel reaction partners such as                       nucleophilic carbenes, isocyanides and other species in an                      attempt to make a wide range of heterocyclic ring systems                       easily accessible. Also, an important objective will be the                     development of intramolecular versions of these newly                           discovered reactions. A second area will be to examine the                      unique characteristics of vinyl isocyanides. It is envisioned                   that these species represent an effective equivalent to an                      \"umpoled\" version of the vinyl isocyanate series. The                           usefulness of these compounds in a range of synthetic problems                  will be investigated.                                                                                                                                           %%%                                                                                                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                  Division will support the research of Dr. James H. Rigby of                     the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University. The                      program will develop synthetic methodology for the preparation                  of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds using vinyl                       isocyanates and vinyl isocyanides as reagents. The structural                   features of the heterocycles are found in a wide variety of                     important natural products and thus are significant synthetic                   targets.",
