 "awd_abstract_narration": "The impact, or dynamic pounding, of adjacent                                    buildings has been identified as a major                                        cause of damage during severe earthquakes.                                      Because of the serious potential of                                             structural and nonstructural damage by                                          pounding during seismic events, efficient                                       methods and techniques to mitigate this                                         impact are needed.                                                                                                                                              The proposed research is aimed at the                                           development of pounding reduction devices                                       (PRDs) for adjacent buildings located in                                        congested urban centers.  Consideration will                                    be given to the systematic treatment of                                         uncertainties in the knowledge of the                                           properties and mechanics of existing                                            buildings subject to pounding and in                                            predicting future earthquake ground motions.                                    These uncertainties will play an important                                      role in optimizing the mechanical properties                                    of the proposed PRD components.                                                                                                                                 This research will investigate the economic                                     feasibility of installing PDRs, developing                                      promising mechanical design concepts, a model                                   application, and analysis methods.  In                                          addition the research focuses on the                                            development of hardware specifications for                                      the devices and methods of installation.",
