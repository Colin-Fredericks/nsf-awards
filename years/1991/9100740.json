Ten undergraduates will participate                in long-term ecological research projects in central New Mexico.                As part of the NSF Long-Term Ecological Research Network, the                   Sevilleta LTER site provides students with a unique opportunity                 to examine ecological processes at the boundaries of several                    major southwestern biomes (Chihuahuan Desert, Great Plains                      Grassland, Great Basin Shrub-Steppe, Interior Chaparral, Pinon-                 Juniper Woodland and Sub-Alpine Forest).  Working in direct                     association with the 19 LTER faculty researchers, the REU                       students will become involved in a wide variety of ecology                      studies, including meteorology, botany, zoology, watershed                      dynamics, nutrient cycling, landscape ecology, GIS and data                     management/computer systems.  Students will participate in a                    seminar series, learn various field research techniques, design                 and implement their own research project, orally report and                     publish their results, and travel to a national scientific                      meeting with the LTER faculty.  These activities will serve to                  integrate various aspects of the LTER Program, and facilitate a                 holistic approach to ecosystem studies.",
