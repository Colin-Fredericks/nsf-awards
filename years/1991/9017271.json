 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North Armorican Massif is part of the Armorican Plate that             separated from N. America, Baltica and Gondwana in the early                    Paleozoic.  Large segments of Armorica were affected by the late                Precambrian Cadomian orogeny, and the massif is one of very few                 areas where there is no apparent overprinting of Cadomian aged                  rocks during the late Paleozoic Variscan orogeny.  This area is                 thus critical for resolution of tectonic linkages with correlative              Avalonian and/or Pan-African sequences.  Existing models for the                Cadomian orogeny have a limited geochemical data base, although                 recent field work has shown that complex polyphase Precambrian                  metamorphic/structural events occurred.  This study will make                   systematic determination of 40Ar/39Ar mineral ages and selected U-Pb            zircon ages from representative lithological units within the                   massif, and will be conducted in collaboration with British field               geologists working in the area.  Co-operation with local French                 geologists has been arranged.  The results of this research will                permit detailed evaluation of Precambrian tectonothermal events and             will help constrain tectonic models for the region.",
