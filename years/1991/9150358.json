The groups will design                  experiments that are productive and efficient, carry them out, and              report on them.  The students will be assigned cooperative roles                and taught technical and personal skills needed to be effective in              group activities.  Experimental design including methods of                     identifying important experimental factors, optimizing the factors,             and collecting appropriate data to characterize the response of a               system will be a primary concern.  The teamwork and experimental                design activities will provide students a better understanding of               what scientists do and a more complete preparation for scientific               careers.  Information will be gathered to discover changes in                   student attitudes toward cooperative activities and science.",
