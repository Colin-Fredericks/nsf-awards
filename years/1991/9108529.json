 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore the degree to which the basic                        cognitive functions of memory and categorization are adapted to                 the structure of the environment.  It is based on the hypotheses                that human memory functions to make most available that                         information which is most likely to be needed in the current                    context and that we form categories of objects to maximize our                  ability to make predictions about new objects.  In the case of                  memory, the research will explore how the need for information                  varies with the pattern of past use of that information and the                 cues available in the environment.  The environments to be                      explored will be both linguistic environments such as newspapers                and biological environments as recorded in animal counts.                       Experiments will determine whether availability of information in               memory varies in the same way as need for that information varies               in the environment.  In the case of categorization, the research                will explore how features cluster across objects in our                         environment.  The environments to be explored will be various                   data sets that have been gathered in the machine learning                       research on categorization.  Experiments will determine if human                predictions of object features show sensitivity to the same                     variables that are predictive in these environments.  The theory                to be developed will tie the two domains of memory and                          categorization together as two manifestations of cognition's                    effort to come up with accurate models of its environment.  This                research, with its adaptive focus, should allow us to better                    understanding function and disfunction of human memory.",
