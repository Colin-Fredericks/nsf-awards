 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many variables that affect the physical and mechanical                properties of crystalline polymers through the processing and                   fabrication stages of manufacture.  Four of the most important are              temperature, pressure, molecular weight, and chain microstructure.              The long-term objective of this research is to understand the way               in which all four of these variables interact in determining the                details of the crystallization process.  Building on past work, the             synergistic effects of these variables will be investigated for                 several systems.  Several recent important developments in                      crystallization theory will be investigated for homopolymers and                copolymers based principally on polyethylene, polypropylene, and                some semi-rigid polymers.  The research will enable quantitative                analysis to be made of crystallization theories.  It will help                  unravel the complicated synergisms of the variables referred to                 above.  In addition it will investigate the dependence on pressure-             temperature of the phase transformations in polypropylene, which                may be of significance to the development of new processing                     methods.  Much of the basic aspects of the research will involve                experimental and theoretical approaches to this essential, but                  relatively unexplored, feature of crystallization.",
