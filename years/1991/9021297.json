 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Malacology Collection in the Florida Museum of Natural                 History includes more than 250,000 lots, principally New World                  freshwater and land mollusks.  This collection has grown rapidly                during the past decade through integration of several large and                 important \"orphaned\" collections, abandoned by other                            universities, museums, and private collectors.  Dr. Fred                        Thompson, Curator of the collection, proposes to add 159 specimen               cabinets to the collection, all of which would be mounted on a                  compactor system that was recently shifted from the Museum's                    Archeology Department to Malacology.  This shift has added 47% to               the area allocated to Malacology, and the requested cabinets will               provide expansion space for approximately 10 years and will                     allow orphaned collections to be captured without delay.                             The proposed project will enhance the growth and improvement               of an important natural history collection.  Researchers in                     systematic biology, ecology, population biology, and many other                 fields will benefit from the heightened accessibility of these                  research collections.",
