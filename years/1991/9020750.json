 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Kirch and his                     colleagues will conduct archaeological, ecological and                          paleoecological research on the island of Mangaia which is part                 of the Cook Islands chain. They will extract several soil cores                 to obtain pollen to reconstruct changing vegetation over the last               several thousand years.  These data will be supplemented by the                 analysis of faunal remains which document the periods both before               and after first human occupation.  Geomorphological studies will                show how landforms changed in response to both changing sea level               and intensive human exploitation.  Finally, archaeological survey               and excavation will serve to elucidate the estimated 2000 year                  span since the first occupation of the island by humans.  Dr.                   Kirch wishes to trace changes in population density, land use and               political organization.  These data will then provide a context                 within which to study the social organization and economy of the                present day descendants.  A wealth of ethnographic data exists.                                                                                                 The islands of Polynesia provide a unique anthropological                       laboratory because they were all colonized in the last several                  thousand years by basically a single cultural group.  The islands               vary in size and environment and degree of isolation. The                       inhabitants also exhibit a number of different forms of social                  organization.  Anthropologists have attempted to relate variation               in social behavior to variation in island type and through this                 exercise understand the mechanisms which govern human response to               environmental variation.  Mangaia exhibits an unusual form of                   organization in which chiefly inherited rights are balanced by                  individually achieved status.  Kirch believes that this can only                be understood in terms of changing human - environment relations                over time and this project is designed to investigate that                      interaction.                                                                                                                                                    This project is important for several reasons.  It will increase                our understanding of the organizational principles of tribal-                   based societies (which continue to exist in many parts of the                   world.).  It will also show how groups act in the face of                       increasingly limited resources and the strategies of adaptation                 they develop.  The work will provide data of interest to a large                group of archaeologists and help to train young scientists.",
