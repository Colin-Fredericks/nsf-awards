 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the exception of psychology and the health sciences, women                 continue to represent only marginal participants in the continuing              flow of new doctorates into the U.S. science and engineering talent             pool.  The output of graduate training directly affects the pools               of talent available to research organizations; colleges and                     universities; civic, governmental, and religious entities;                      businesses; and elementary and secondary education.  As William                 Bowen said,                                                                                                                                                          At their best, those who earn graduate degrees in the arts and                  sciences contribute not only their own ideas to society, but                    also a capacity to educate and prepare those who will exercise                  leadership on a broad scale.                                                                                                                               Clearly, the extent to which women can be players in this labor                 market rests on their number emerging each year from graduate                   training.                                                                                                                                                       The factors that affect the level of participation of women in                  graduate training and in the labor force are well known and include             the availability of adequate financial support, interactions with               role models and mentors who can provide guidance in potential                   career choices, support of family members and peers, opportunities              to interact with women scientists and engineers in similar academic             programs or employment, and even women's own confidence in their                ability to \"do\" math and science.  The role of a continuing                     committee would be to identify the factors that can be influenced               rapidly and efficiently and to generate an action plan to do so.                The action plan to be developed by the Committee on Women in                    Science and Engineering of the National Research Council (NRC) will             respond both to needs identified by Federal and private sponsors                as well as by the expert opinions of the committee of leaders in                this area.",
