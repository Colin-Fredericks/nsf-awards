 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will determine what role cell lineage plays in                the specification of cell fate during vertebrate neuronal                       development.  They will study the early embryo of the zebrafish,                in which they can mark individual cells, transplant them, and                   follow them as they develop in living embryos.  They have shown                 previously that gastrula cells generate clones restricted to                    single tissues, yet if the cells are transplanted, they produce                 new lineages.  The early cells, therefore, may express position-                specific developmental programs that determine their early                      behavior, but do not restrict their potential.  To further our                  understanding of the developmental roles of cell lineage, the                   investigators will study in vivo the lineages that normally arise               from singly marked cells, learning the patterns of division,                    movements, and lineage relationships of a variety of cell types,                including identified neurons.  To investigate cellular                          commitments and clues provided by the environment, they will                    examine lineages and fates of cells transplanted individually                   between embryos.",
