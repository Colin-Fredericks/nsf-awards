 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will concentrate on the effects of oxygen-derived free               radicals.  These oxidants are generated not only by lonizing                    radiation but also by normal aerobic metabolism in almost all                   cells.  They have been implicated as causes of mutations, cancer,               aging and of tissue damage associated with inflammation.  This                  proposal will focus on a specific multigene system in Escherichia               coli that is induced by compounds that generate superoxide.  This               global response includes the genes for the DNA repair enzyme                    endonuclease IV, for a superoxide dismutase, and for glucose-6-                 phosphate dehydrogenase, all of which are positively regulated at               a transcriptional level by soxR and soxS, newly discovered genes                that have been cloned, mapped and sequenced in this laboratory.                 The soxRS region will be transcriptionally mapped and tested for                exogenous and endogenous regulation.  Existing mutations will be                sequenced and additional specific ones produced if needed.  The                 proteins will be purified and their effect will tested in vitro                 on the transcription of one of the target genes, that for                       endonuclease IV (nfo).  In the likely event that one or both or                 the proteins bind on the nfo promoter region, then the contact                  points will be identified via footprinting, in vitro modification               of the DNA, sequencing of promoter-constitutive mutations, and a                survey of target sites in other genes.  Physical studies of the                 purified proteins will center around possible proteins-proteins                 and protein-nucleic acid interactions, conformational changes                   accompanying activation, and the function of four close cysteines               in soxR.  Posttranscriptional control will be explored by                       connecting the nfo (endonuclease IV) target gene to foreign                     promoters and possible feedback loops will be examined by                       measuring nfo transcription and translation in cells with                       different copy numbers of the gene.  If the entire system cannot                be reconstructed in vitro, then additional genes in this pathway                will be sought through mutation, employing gene fusions as                      indicators.                                                                      //",
