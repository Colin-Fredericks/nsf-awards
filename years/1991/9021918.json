 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laboratory experiments to simulate ice particles in cirrus                 and convective clouds will investigate conditions for break up                  and separation of electric charge.  A system will be constructed                to generate monodisperse ice crystals of selected size and shape                whose optical properties will be examined in a specially designed               and constructed optical system.  Results will be compared with                  field data already obtained during flights through hurricanes,                  maritime convective cells off Florida, convective feeder clouds                 in North Dakota and new data to be obtained on the NOAA P3 during               CAPE (1991).  This will include measurements of electric field                  and microphysical evolution (ice particles, coalescence drops and               their electric charge) as convective clouds evolve overland in                  Florida.  Results will also be compared with radiation and other                aircraft data obtained by higher flying aircraft in cirrus as it                becomes available.  A simple numerical model of heat evolution in               convective clouds will be constructed applicable to assessing the               vertical heat budget of deep convective cloud systems involving                 both ice and coalescence precipitation processes.",
