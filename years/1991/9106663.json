 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. C. Melvin Aikens, Ms Pamela Endzweig,                a graduate student in Anthropology at the University of Oregon,                 will collect information for her doctoral dissertation. Focussing               on the John Day River and tributary Pine Creek, located in the                  Plateau region of Oregon, Ms Endzweig will both conduct a survey                and analyze data already collected.  In the course of a multiyear               field project, the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry has                    located and excavated a number of archeological sites which span                a period of over two thousand years and thus document a                         significant portion of the region's prehistory.  However, much of               the rich cultural material recovered has not been properly                      analyzed and, in addition to her own survey, MS Endzweig will                   coordinate the analyses of these remains.  Abundant faunal and                  floral material will be studied.  Together they will give insight               into the prehistoric ecology of the region and provide                          information on how its use by Native American peoples changed                   over time.  These data should also give an indication of the                    seasons during which individual sites were occupied.  Chemical                  composition of chert tools will also be determined.  This will                  permit - hopefully - artifacts to be matched to geological source               and thus provide insight into larger trade networks.                                                                                                            Although considerable archaeological research has been conducted                in the Plateau region, much has been associated with cultural                   resource management work and therefore is concentrated primarily                in the base of large river valleys.  The result is an extremely                 incomplete and skewed picture of the prehistoric way of life.                   While some archaeologists have argued that the observed historic                pattern in which population did concentrate in river valleys can                be projected back into the distant past, others disagree and                    point to emerging data of the type which Ms Endzweig is                         collecting.  Her present research should shed important light on                this issue.                                                                                                                                                     This project is important for several reasons. It will increase                 our understanding of how humans operating at a simple level of                  technology adapted to a difficult and fluctuating environment.                  It will provide data of interest to a large number of                           archaeologists and finally assist in the training of a promising                young scientist.",
