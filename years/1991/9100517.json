 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to help support a doctoral dissertation.  The                     dissertation will utilize the 1850-1880 federal census of                       population and agriculture to produced a pooled cross-section of                panel-like data for six rural townships in Missouri.  The purpose               of the study is analyze the relationship between changes in family              and household demography and changes in economic performance in the             sample townships.  The major question to be addressed is how did                fertility, persistence, race, and birthplace affect tenancy rates,              farm income and market orientation during this crucial period in                American development?  Statistical tests will be undertaken to                  determine the degree of correlation between family characteristics              and the path and progress of agricultural development.  It will                 then be determined how a family's characteristics aided or hindered             the production of an agricultural surplus for sale in the market.               This project is important because it will provide a better                      understanding of the economic process during a crucial period in                American history.",
