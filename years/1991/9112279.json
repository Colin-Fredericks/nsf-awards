 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant if for the purchase of an ultra-violet                               spectroscopy system for research on the chemistry                               and thermodynamics of epitaxial growth by                                       chemical beam epitaxy in-situ and in real time.                                 UV spectroscopy is a powerful scientific tool that is                           best suited for the study of growth processes by                                chemical beam epitaxy.  The equipment described                                 in this proposal will create the capability for UV                              absorption spectroscopy and laser-induced                                       fluorescence spectroscopy.  These two techniques                                will be used for the investigation of epitaxial growth                          of III-V semiconductor and alloy microstructures.                               In contrast to molecular beam epitaxy in which                                  elemental sources are used, gas sources (metal-                                 organics and hydrides) are used in chemical beam                                epitaxy.  Consequently the chemical dynamics of                                 epitaxial growth are more complex, but easier to                                measure than is the case in MBE.  With the                                      equipment requested in this proposal, it will be                                possible to obtain quantitative chemical information                            by probing the region just above the substrate.  This                           equipment can provide information about the                                     concentrations and electronic states of molecular                               and atomic species.  The type of equipment needed                               for the UV spectroscopy described in this proposal                              is not available as a single unit from any supplier,                            and in order to perform such studies, it is necessary                           to assemble appropriate individual components.",
