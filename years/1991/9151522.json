 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many small colleges, one physics instructor is called upon                   to teach several different levels of introductory physics.                      There generally are not enough students to justify offering                     parallel lecture style classes at a given time to students with                 varying calculus proficiency.Workshop Physics is a teaching                     system in which students build their own understanding of                       physics by direct interaction with phenomena.  Traditional                      lectures are replaced by guided hands-on activities for                         students working in small groups.   Microcomputers interfaced                   with laboratory equipment allow for real-time measurements and                  immediate interpretation of results by the students.This                        project is resulting in an instructional design in which both                   calculus-based and non-calculus students learn physics in the                   same classroom/laboratory at the same time with one teacher                     using The Workshop Physics approach.   Improved learning and                    better use of instructional resources are the outcomes.NSF                      grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal                       sources.",
