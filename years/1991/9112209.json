 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transport of various penetrants in well characterized,                      thin sections of coal will be examined at high temperatures                     (250-400\u001aC) using an Advanced Thermal Analysis System in an                     effort to investigate the mechanisms of transport in the                        highly crosslinked network structure of coal and to elucidate                   the effort of solvents in altering its chemical structure.                                                                                                      Experimental Studies will be performed at high temperatures                     both above and below Tg using thin sections varying in                          thickness from 20 to 1000 \u001am.  In addition we will synthesize                   highly crosslinked polymers by reaction of multifunctional                      methacrylates such as di', tri' and tetramethacrylates.  Such                   polymer systems are glassy with high glass transition                           temperatures and well defined crosslinked structures.  They                     will be swollen both by dynamic and equilibrium studies in the                  same penetrants as the coal networks.  Then, the results from                   these two investigations will be compared in order to                           elucidate the nature of the crosslinked coal network                            structure.  Mathematical models will be developed to describe                   the unusual transport of penetrants (solvents) in coal.  These                  results will have direct applicability in the elucidation of                    the mass transfer limitations in coal processing, the                           importance of solvents in altering chemical stability and the                   mechanisms of molecular dissociation.                                                                                                                           The requested equipment, Advanced Thermal Analysis System,                      will be used to analyze the macromolecular coal structure at                    high temperature.  The differential scanning calorimetry                        module will provide the glass transition temperature of the                     macromolecular coal network structure as a function of a                        penetrant content.  The thermomechanical and dynamic                            mechanical analysis components will elucidate the viscoelastic                  behavior of coal networks below,  around and above their glass                  transition temperature in the presence of penetrants.  The                      thermogravimetric analysis module will be used to obtain                        penetrant uptake data at high temperature and to decouple the                   diffusional and relaxational mechanisms.",
