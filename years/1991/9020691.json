 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Michael Gretz of George Mason University and Dr. Richard                        Furneauz of the New Zealand Department of Scientific and                        Industrial Research (DSIR). Extracellular matrix polysac-                       charides of red algae include the commercially important                        carrageenans and agarocolloids as well as cellulose, xylans,                    mannans, and complex heteropolysaccharides.  Due in part to                     the commercial significance of these compounds and their                        derivatives as gelling, emulsifying and sizing agents, much                     is known of the chemistry of these polymers from selected                       organisms. Relatively little is known, however, about the                       distribution of these and related natural compounds among                       major groups of the red algae. A more detailed survey of this                   plant division is therefore needed. The objective of this                       research is comparative biochemical analysis of cell wall                       polymers of New Zealand and North American red algae using                      techniques recently developed in New Zealand for methylation                    analysis (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), as well as                     nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and x-ray diffraction                          analysis. A second objective is to better understand the                        biosynthetic pathways to these polysacchardides using a                         unique approach currently being developed in the United                         States incorporating  13C-labelling of precursor molecules                      coupled with methylation analysis and NMR.                                                                                                                      The project represents excellent collaboration between the                      U.S. and New Zealand group in utilizing their complementary                     skills in algal polysaccharide research. This is important                      fundmental work on the biochemistry of red algal polysaccrides,                 and has the potential for discovery of sources of additional                    natural products.",
