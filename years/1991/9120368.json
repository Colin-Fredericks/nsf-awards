 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this collaborative research project will identify              and analyze the interactions and feedbacks between the land and                 atmosphere that result in observed complexities and lack of                     predictability of hydroclimatology.  In particular, it is intended              to study the dynamics of soil moisture and its excursions into dry              (drought) and wet (flood) states.                                                    The first hypothesis is that local recycling of moisture at                continental scales, and time periods on the order of seasons to                 years leads to soil moisture dynamics that can be described by a                stochastic differential equation with multiplicative noise.  The                solution to such nonlinear system is a probability distribution of              soil moisture with at least two modes; that is, two preferred                   states, one dry and one wet.  This contrasts with the traditional               unimodal view of the soil moisture distribution.  This distribution             can be studied to obtain answers like the probability of the onset              of drought or vice versa the end of a drought period.  Another                  question of interest is the duration of droughts.  The multimodal               distribution can also be the basis of a new classification of                   climatic regions.                                                                    The second hypothesis is that at time scales on the order of               the occurrence of individual events (i.e., weeks) the soil moisture             has a delayed effect on atmospheric dynamics.  This phenomena is                due to the moisture supply as well as to dynamic influences                     resulting from soil moisture effect on surface temperature and                  atmospheric pressure.  The implication of this hypothesis is a                  highly nonlinear delayed differential equation for the description              of soil moisture.  The solution of this equation leads to a fixed               equilibrium, a limit cycle with bifurcations or to chaos.  This                 will be used to study amplification of seasonal effects over                    continental regions like the Amazonia as well as the predictability             of soil moisture and hydroclimatology in general.  Principal                    Investigators and staff from the University of Arizona and the                  Massachusetts Institute of Technology will collaborate on this                  project.",
