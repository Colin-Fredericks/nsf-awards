 "awd_abstract_narration": "The leukocyte adhesion molecule LFA-1 plays a crucial role in all               forms and levels of immunity.  Leukocytes are able to turn LFA-1                function on or off on a minute-by-minute basis, giving them precise             control over their adhesions with each other and other cells.  The              rapid regulation of LFA-1 function is mediated by protein kinase                C, and does not require changes in cell surface density of LFA-1                or its ligand, ICAM-1.  Rather, the regulation of the avidity of                LFA-1 for ICAM-1 involves poorly defined configurational changes.               Elucidation of these configurational changes is the goal of this                research.  Highly plausible changes would be homotypic clustering               of LFA-1 to increase avidity for ICAM-1 and anchoring to the                    cytoskeleton.  The approach proposed is to quantitate clustering                by flow cytometric analysis of fluorescence resonance energy                    transfer, a method proven capable of estimating mean intermolecular             distances on cell surfaces.  The ability to quantitate clustering               will make it possible to explore its mechanisms, including the                  roles of divalent cations and cytoskeleton.  Anchoring to the                   cytoskeleton will be evaluated by solubility in Triton X-100.                                                                                                   Cellular adhesion plays a critical role in many developmental and               physiological processes, including immune function.  The molecular              mechanisms by which cells recognize and adhere to appropriate                   partners is a subject of great current interest.  The proposed                  research will explore an innovative approach to the study of                    mechanisms by which the strength of adhesion between cells is                   regulated.",
