 "awd_abstract_narration": "The carbon isotopic composition of Cenozoic (8 to 56 Myr)                  paleosol carbonates is significantly different than Mesozoic                    paleosol carbonates, having   C values of about - 10 to - 12 permil             (118 samples) and -6 to -8 permil (21 samples), respectively.  In               this preliminary data set there is only one data point that                     overlaps.  Consideration of the possible causes for this distinct               differences leads to a possible difference in the concentration of              atmospheric CO2 .  If this is true it could lead to a method to                 estimate P(CO2) in the atmosphere to at least 200 Ma ago, greatly               extending our knowledge of paleoatmospheric chemistry.  So far,                 direct measurements of paleo-CO2  measurements go back only 0.16                Ma (Barnola, et al., 1987).                                                          The isotopic composition of soil carbonate records the                     isotopic composition of soil CO2  which is directly related to the              concentration of CO2  in the atmosphere.  For modern soils the                  atmospheric contribution to total soil CO2  is almost negligible.               However, higher atmospheric P(CO2) levels make a significant                    difference in the isotopic composition of soil CO2 and hence, soil              carbonate formed in equilibrium with soil CO2.  In this study we                examine the isotopic composition of paleosol carbonates from the                Mesozoic and Cenozoic with the aim of determining P(CO2) of the                 ancient atmosphere.  Preliminary results suggest that this is a                 viable approach and that Mesozoic CO2 levels were significantly                 higher than today, on the order of 1500 to 2500 ppmV.",
