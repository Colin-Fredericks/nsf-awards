 "awd_abstract_narration": "In parallel computation using parallel random access machines, very             few efficient algorithms are known for problems involving directed              graphs.  The most demonstrative example of this situation is the                problem of directed graph reachability.  In its simplest form, the              problem is to test whether a graph contains a directed path from a              given vertex to another.  The best sequential algorithms for the                problem use simple graph searches and run in optimal linear time.  In           contrast, the best known parallel algorithm for the same problem                computes the transitive closure of the given graph, and uses a                  superlinear number of processors.  Therefore, there is a significant            gap between the optimal sequential and the best known parallel                  complexities of the problem.  This reliance on transitive closure               techniques and the resulting inefficiency are also present in the best          known parallel algorithms for many other fundamental problems in                directed graph theory.                                                          The goal of this project is to remove the complexity bottleneck                 resulting from this undesirable reliance on transitive                          closure techniques.  For fundamental problems on directed graphs,               parallel algorithms will be designed that run in polylogarithmic time           and use only a linear number of processors, and therefore, achieve an           optimal complexity within a polylogarithmic factor.",
