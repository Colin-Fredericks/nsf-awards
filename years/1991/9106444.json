 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with a number of issues in algebraic             geometry, the geometric theory of noncommutative rings, the                     differential topology of complex algebraic varieties, and                       arithmetic algebraic geometry.  These issues include the following:             (1) the enumeration of the multiple-points of a finite map that is              birational onto its image; (2) Whitney equisingularity and the                  Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity; (3) the inseparablility of the Gauss                map of a smooth complete interaction; (4) the enumeration of the                rational normal curves on the generic quintic hypersurface in                   4-space, and the singularity of the Hilbert scheme component of the             rational normal n-ics; (5) the autoduality of the compactified                  Jacobian; (6) the theory of a transition map in the theory of                   residues and duality; (7) quantum projective planes; (8) the                    foundations of noncommutative projective geometry; (9)                          noncommutative projective schemes of dimension 1; (10) maximal                  orders with p-fold ramification in characteristic p; (11) special               polyhedral filtrations; (12) higher Chow groups as derived                      functors; (13) bivariant sheaves and motives; (14) applications of              geometry to the study of class groups of number fields.                              This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, which is              one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics.  In its origin, it               treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest              equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of                 methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology.             It is finding application in those areas of mathematics as well as              in theoretical computer science and in robotics.",
