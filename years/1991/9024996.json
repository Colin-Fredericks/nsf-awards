 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigations in the general area of reactive intermediate                     chemistry will be pursued. Properties of carbenes, twisted pi-                  systems, and boron-containing reactive intermediates will be                    studied. Ring expansion rearrangement of carbenes will be used to               generate twisted pi-systems, that is, bridgehead double bonds.                  Methanol or deutero-methanol will be used to trap these reactive                intermediates, and to thereby determine the relative amounts of                 carbene to bridgehead double bond. The mechanism of the reaction                of carbenes with carboranes will be studied, and the role of a 13-              vertex intermediate will be determined. Intramolecular reactions                of carbenes with carboranes will also be investigated and this can              lead to the preparation of carboranophanes, the carborane analog                of a cyclophane. Preparation and trapping of ortho-and meta-                    benzyne analogs in the carboranes series will be pursued. The                   ortho-benzyne analog will lead to the carborane version of                      benzocyclobutadiene.                                                            %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Maitland Jones at Princeton                        University. Carbenes and twisted double bonds are two reactive                  species that will be studied. A carbon atom to which there are                  only two bonds, rather than the normal four bonds, is called a                  carbene. Since two bonds to carbon are missing in a carbene they                are reactive species, and Dr. Jones will employ them to generate                another reactive species, a twisted double bond. These studies                  will be pursued with compounds that contain only carbon and                     hydrogen (hydrocarbons), and with carboranes (compounds that                    contain a spherical array of carbon and boron atoms).",
