 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a Research Training Group in Animal               Behavior that will be initiated in conjunction with a new Center                for Animal Behavior at the Davis Campus of the University of                    California.  The faculty group consists of 15 junior and senior                 investigators from the Departments of Zoology and Psychology and                from the Regional Primate Center in Davis.  The funds awarded                   will provide stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral                    trainees, will support research during the summer by                            undergraduates, and will defray part of the cost of the trainees'               research.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase                          specialized research equipment to be used by trainees and to                    bring investigators from other research and academic institutions               to the campus for seminars and, in particular, for an intensive                 workshop to be held at the time of spring break each year.                                                                                                      The study of animal behavior both requires and provides new                     insights into the study of animals as organisms.  Increasingly,                 multidisciplinary approaches that recognize the interaction of                  genetic, developmental, physiological and environmental                         determinants are playing an important role in the analysis of                   behavior.  Among the research topics represented by the training                group's faculty are the development and neurophysiology of animal               communication, the analysis of the evolution of behavior using                  invertebrate models, physiological sources and consequences of                  social dynamics and reproduction, and proximate mechanisms in                   social behavior and socioecology.  These varied research                        activities, coupled with an intensive program of seminars by                    resident and invited faculty will expose trainees to the newest                 techniques and ideas while equipping them with a solid foundation               in established methodologies and concepts.",
