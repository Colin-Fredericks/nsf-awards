This project addresses the                                     importance in attaining this objective by                                       ensuring that buildings will not fail while                                     undergoing inelastic response.  This research                                   is part of an effort which seeks to provide a                                   practical and reliable methods to check the                                     safety of a building against inelastic                                          dynamic instability.                                                                                                                                            The specific objectives of the research are:                                    a) To investigate the means of identifying                                      the kinematic mechanism that will control a                                     building's dynamic response to sufficiently                                     strong ground motions. b) To calculate                                          instability limits for a number of                                              representative buildings and ground motions                                     using accurate mathematical models. c) To                                       examine the matter of inelastic dynamic                                         instability in the context of code-based                                        seismic design and develop recommended                                          guidelines for design.                                                                                                                                          The development of a method to check                                            instability which accounts for the inelastic                                    dynamic nature of the problem is currently                                      recognized as one of the priority needs for                                     improving seismic design performance                                            standards.  This research will lead to a                                        better understanding of how to prevent single                                   story and other undesirable collapse                                            mechanisms.",
