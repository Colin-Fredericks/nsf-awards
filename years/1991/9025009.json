 "awd_abstract_narration": "Explanations of modern geographic patterns frequently must be              grounded in examinations of the historical developments that                    established and modified processes at work on antecedent patterns.              Many new insights about the operation and spatial arrangement of                service-delivery systems have come from studies of the historical               evolution of those system.  Health-care delivery in modern Africa, for          example, continues to be strongly impacted by the pattern of facilities         established by Protestant and Catholic religious orders in early                periods of European colonization in the 19th and early 20th centuries.          This project will use perspectives and techniques of medical and                historical geography to assess how the health of African people and the         conditions of the places they inhabited were changed by the activities          of religious medical missions.  It also will examine the ways that              native Africans responded to the different medical, social, and                 technological features associated with the missions.  The analysis will         focus on two longitudinal, comparative case studies of missions in              Kenya and Malawi.  Information for use in this analysis will be                 gathered from government and institutional archives, from informal              interviews and field observations in the study areas, and from oral             histories of people who were involved with mission facilities over the          last 70 years.  NSF funding will complement support for this project            provided by the National Geographic Society through its Committee for           Research and Exploration.                                                            This project will provide specific information about the                   development of religious medical missions in the study areas.  The              analyses of this information will contribute not only to focused                understandings about the historical geography of medical care in these          nations; it also will enhance general understandings of the ways that           institutional activities originating in foreign cultures interacted             with indigenous populations to alter ways of life and standards of              living.",
