 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study a methanogen with unusual physiological                 attributes--the inability to produce methane from either carbon                 dioxide or acetate, but to do so from methanol provided that                    hydrogen is present.  Surprising is the fact that a great deal of               carbon of cell components is derived from acetate or carbon dioxide             and little from methanol; it is this latter aspect of biosynthesis              that is the focus of investigations that will use 13-C labelled                 acetate or carbon dioxide, followed by high-resolution NMR studies,             to elucidate key carbon-entrance pathways using intact cells and                cell extracts.  Key enzymatic reactions and coenzyme requirements               of central reactions of the apparently unusual reduced one-carbon               biosynthetic pathway(s) will also be studied.                                                                                                                   The study of a physiologically-unusual methanogenic                             archaebacterium, with the goal of understanding the means by which              acetate and carbon dioxide carbon are built into cellular                       components is the focus of this project which involves                          collaboration between microbiologists and chemists.  //",
