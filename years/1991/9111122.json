 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop techniques for                the automatic generation of sculptured surface models in a                      spatially constrained environment, subject to specified intrinsic               shape properties.  Spatial constraints will be characterized by a               distance metric relating surface points to polyhedral models which              represent either components in the vicinity of the surface, or the              boundaries of regions that the surface must avoid.  The shape of                the surface will be governed by constraints based on intrinsic                  properties such as tangency and curvature, which will be derived                from general characterizations of design intent.  To simultaneously             address the independent goals of global obstacle avoidance and                  local control of intrinsic shape properties, surface synthesis will             be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem to be solved              via simulated annealing (SA).  Preliminary experiments with this                technique are very promising.                                                        Some of the research issues to be addressed include:                       synthesis of general non-uniform rational B-spline surfaces;                    derivation of analytical surface design constraints based on                    objective characterizations of manufacturability and functional                 requirements, and from subjective measures of surface aesthetics;               optimal estimation of parameters associated with the SA algorithm               for surface synthesis; problem formulation for multiple spatial                 obstacles; possible hybrid SA/classical optimization techniques;                performance oriented variations of the SA algorithm; and, user                  interface design and implementation.  Automated surfacing                       capabilities will facilitate simultaneous engineering and provide               product designers with a rapid analytical prototyping facility.                 Given the wide spectrum of potential applications, this research                may have a profound impact on the efficiency of the development                 process for many products.",
