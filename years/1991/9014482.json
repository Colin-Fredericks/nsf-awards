 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems addressed by this research project are in the                 area of geometric topology.  Their common theme centers on                      automorphism groups of various kinds of spaces.  Primarily these                spaces are manifolds of various dimensions, but also addressed                  here are issues concerning more general kinds of spaces, such as                trees or complexes.  What kinds of groups can effectively act on                such spaces?  What does the space tell one about the group?  This               leads to focusing on the groups themselves, and how they                        decompose, or how they can act on other simple spaces, for                      example, trees.  It is worthwhile to understand the topology of                 various possible classifying spaces for these groups, and what                  they look like at infinity.                                                          In addition to the principal investigator, R. D. Edwards,                  two faculty associates, Mladen Bestvina and Geoffrey Mess, and                  two advanced graduate students are involved.  The work of all                   participants focuses on abstract spaces and the application of                  algebraic methods to their classification and understanding.                    There has been an enormous amount of activity in all of these                   areas in recent years, and there is much opportunity for further                progress.",
