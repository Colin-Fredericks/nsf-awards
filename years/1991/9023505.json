 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth's deep interior remains a major scientific frontier that              holds the key to understanding the origin of the planet, its                    evolution through geologic time to the present structure, and the               internal causes of plate dynamics, earthquakes, volcanism, and the              geomagnetic field. Inaccessible to direct observation below a few               kilometers (the limit of drilling and exposure by erosion) the                  Earth's crust, mantle, and core are primarily studied through their             interaction with seismic waves. Recent developments in seismic                  sensor design, digital data acquisition, transmission, and storage              techniques make possible dramatic improvements in the resolving                 power of seismic imaging methods.                                                                                                                               The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology, or the IRIS              Consortium, is composed of 70 U.S. universities with research and               teaching programs in seismology. It serves as a national facility               for the development, deployment, and support of modern digital                  seismic instrumentation, and its mission is organized into three                major program elements: (1) The Global Seismographic Network (GSN)              program provides the U.S. contribution to an international network              of 128 permanent, standardized, very-broad-band (VBB), wide dynamic             range digital seismic stations at a spacing of approximately 2000               km around the globe. (2) The Program for Array  Seismic Studies of              the Continental Lithosphere (PASSCAL) aims to establish a U.S.                  national resource of 600 portable seismometer systems available for             field deployment in specific seismic imaging experiments and for                rapid response to earthquake studies. (3) The IRIS Data Management              System (DMS) aims to provide the national and international seismic             research community with timely access to data from the GSN and                  PASSCAL programs. It archives and distributes the data from these               programs and facilitates the standardization and exchange of data.                                                                                              During its initial five years of operation from 1986 to 1990, the               IRIS Consortium accomplished the following specific tasks: (1) It               developed the IRIS-1 and IRIS-2 lines of standardized permanent                 station instrumentation employing VBB sensor technology for the                 GSN. Two IRIS operations and maintenance facilities for the GSN                 were installed at the U.S. Geological Survey's Albuquerque                      Seismological Laboratory and at the University of California, San               Diego. Currently, 25 GSN VBB stations have been installed world-                wide and are returning data. (2) The PASSCAL program has developed              two lines of standardized portable seismographic instrument                     packages. One hundred of these  are currently housed at the first               PASSCAL Instrument Center, located at the Lamont-Doherty Geological             Observatory. PASSCAL instruments have already been used in a number             of planned field experiments, and were rapidly deployed for                     aftershock studies of the 1987 Armenia and 1989 Loma Prieta,                    California earthquakes. (3) The DMS has established GSN data                    collection nodes at the Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory and                at the University of California, San Diego. An IRIS central data                archive and distribution center is temporarily operating at the                 Center for High Performance Computing at the University of Texas.               Through Internet, U.S. users (and European users via the ORFEUS                 data center in the Netherlands) have access to the continuous data              streams from most of the existing GSN stations, to major-event                  waveform data in near-real time, and to special datasets from                   important earthquakes as well as from PASSCAL field experiments.                                                                                                This award provides support for IRIS activities in 1991-1995.                   During this period IRIS will:                                                                                                                                        -- Install an additional 50-60 stations of the GSN, bringing                       the total IRIS GSN stations to 75-85 (completion of the                         planned 128-station global network will be achieved with                        additional stations contributed by IRIS' international                          partners in the GSN and coordinated by the internationally                      organized Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks).                                                                                                       -- Purchase an additional 500 PASSCAL portable seismographic                       units of standard IRIS design and manage their deployment                       and maintenance for the seismology research community                           through the establishment of two additional PASSCAL                             Instrument Centers to be located at U.S. universities.                                                                                                       -- Install and develop to full capacity a permanent Data                           Management Center (DMC) to be located at a U.S. university.                     The five-year objectives of the DMC include complete                            archiving of the world-wide continuous VBB data, very rapid                     turnaround of customized datasets to the international                          seismology  community, and improvement of current                               capabilities for managing data from PASSCAL one- and two-                       dimensional array field experiments.                                                                                                                         -- Assume a leadership role in reaching out to the science                         community regarding the use of IRIS facilities in earth                         sciences research by sponsoring an annual science planning                      workshop. IRIS will also formulate and implement a plan for                     the use of PASSCAL instruments in rapid response to                             earthquake prediction and aftershock monitoring needs.                                                                                                       -- Create an inexpensive version of the portable PASSCAL                           instrumentation with coordinated educational materials that                     will permit low-cost high-school involvement in seismic                         monitoring, and develop an educational state-of-the-art                         traveling museum exhibit of a complete seismographic                            station, with direct real-time connection with the IRIS                         Data Management Center.",
