 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the regulation of vertebrate renal                    function, focusing on the reptiles.  Although paradigms have been               accepted for the regulation of the kidney in nonmammalian                       vertebrates, relatively little quantitative data is available for               any group.  This study proposes to investigate the determinants of              release for hormones likely to influence renal function.  And to                provide important information on the hormonal regulation of the                 reptilian kidney at the whole organ level and at the level of the               single functional unit within the kidney, the nephron.  These                   approaches will utilize intact animal studies, isolated organ                   perfusion, and intravital microscopy.  Although mammals and                     nonmammalian vertebrates share virtually all the hormonal and                   neural components for the control of excretion by the kidney, the               relationships between plasma hormones, neural activity, and renal               function appear to be significantly different.  This variation in               the response of the kidney and in regulatory dominance among                    vertebrates may allow specific regulatory mechanisms to be more                 easily observed and elucidated in nonmammalian kidneys.  Therefore,             this project will markedly broaden our understanding of the                     regulation of reptilian kidney function, and at the same time, may              provide a useful model for investigating principles and mechanisms              of renal regulation by hormonal and neural control shared by all                vertebrates.//",
