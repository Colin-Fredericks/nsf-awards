 "awd_abstract_narration": "Politics is fundamentally about aggregation.  Organizing diverse                elements into stable and enduring coalitions is a central concern               of political activity.  Political parties attempt to forge enduring             coalitions of interests across multiple social cleavages. Nations               pursue alliances for mutual security.  Legislatures organize so as              to facilitate the development of majority coalitions that can enact             legislation.  To date, however, separate theories of political                  aggregation have been developed for each of the various aspects of              politics in which aggregation is of concern.  This important                    research attempts to develop a general theory of aggregation which              can account for the organizational dynamics of diverse social                   systems.                                                                                                                                                        Specifically, this research uses concepts from the physical                     sciences and biology to develop and test a formal model of                      aggregation called landscape theory.  It seeks to develop a                     relatively simple model that has wide applications to a variety of              aggregation problems including international alliances, coalitions              of political parties, social networks, and social cleavages in                  democracies among many others.  The research will proceed in                    phases. It will begin by elaborating the theory adding complexity               and realism.  It will proceed to distill general principles of                  aggregation from across the several applications.  Finally, it will             test the theory with data for each of the applications.                                                                                                         When completed this research should greatly enhance our                         understanding of the dynamics of aggregation in politics.",
