 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of in-situ produced cosmogenic helium to measure                   surface exposure ages has many applications in the earth sciences.              Because 3He is stable and has a high production rate (by cosmic                 ray spallation), it can be used to measure the ages of both young               (~ kyr) and old (~myr) surfaces.  However, there are a number of                important problems that must be addressed.  Most important, it is               critical to have accurate determination of the production rate as               a function of latitude, altitude and depth and time.  The                       acquisition of new data from young radiocarbon dated lava flows                 will help constrain the reason for the apparent 3He production rate             changes during the last 10 ka (which may be partly due to dipole                moment fluctuations).  In addition, it is critical to know                      diffusion rates to assess the importance of diffusive helium loss.              This proposal seeks funds to address these problems with new                    measurements of dated lava flows and glacial moraines, production               rate experiments, and diffusion measurements.  The combination of               field work and laboratory experiments proposed is critical to                   evaluating the precision of the technique, the basic assumptions                involved, and for developing surface exposure dating for use in                 geomorphology, glacial geology, volcanology, and archaeology.",
