 "awd_abstract_narration": "Being the terminus for stellar evolution, white dwarfs are                      important in astronomy.  Their existence as remnants of previous                generations of stars makes them convenient probes of the formation              of massive stars back to the birth of the disk of our Milky Way                 Galaxy.  In addition, their structure is well defined: if their                 chemical compositions and masses are specified, their radii become              determined.  In this work the Principal Investigator (PI) will                  combine his efforts with two collaborators; their joint effort will             be a collaborative NSF supported venture. The three PI's will                   complete a survey of white dwarfs in widely spaced double stars.                The companions of these stars are on the main sequence, and their               radial velocities, apparent brightnesses, and colors will permit                accurate estimates of the masses and luminosities of the white                  dwarfs.  High resolution spectra will be obtained of these objects              in order to estimate the surface chemical compositions and magnetic             field strengths.  When completed, this study is expected to permit              the compilation of the most accurate and homogeneous physical                   parameters for white dwarfs to date.",
