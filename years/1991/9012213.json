 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this research is to take advantage of the                 powerful genetic capabilities available in the yeast, Saccharomyces             cerevisiae to understand 1) The kinds of potassium transporters                 present in this eukaryote and 2) the structure and function of the              transporters.  The questions to be addressed in the near term are               the following:  What are the structural and functional                          similarities, if any, between the high and low affinity potassium               transporters already identified?  What is the topological                       organization of these potassium transporters in the plasma                      membrane?  Which amino acids in the transporter polypeptides are                involved in the mechanism of potassium transport?  A gene, TRK1,                likely to encode the high-affinity potassium transporter, has been              cloned, as has a gene, TRK2, required for low-affinity potassium                uptake.  Goals for the next three years are:  1) to define                      topological features of the high-affinity transporter (TRK1); 2)                to determine the relationship between TRK1 structure and function               by combining site-directed mutagenesis with in vivo functional                  assays; 3) to determine the molecular basis of potassium affinity               and identify amino acids likely to interact directly with potassium             ions by isolation and analysis of mutations in TRK1 that increase               discrimination between potassium and rubidium; 4) to pursue a                   molecular analysis of the TRK2 gene; 5) to determine the molecular              basis of mutations in the TRK2 gene and determine their                         physiological effects, 6) to determine the molecular changes in                 TRK2D mutants (alleles of TRK2 that enhance low-affinity potassium              uptake); and 7) to assess the functional roles of the high and low-             affinity potassium transporters.  Future goals include genetically              identifying potassium channel genes in yeast.                                                                                                                   The proposed research is a continuation of the molecular and                    genetic analysis of potassium transport in the yeast, Saccharomyces             cerevisiae.  This small eukaryote is useful as a model system in                which to examine the molecular basis of potassium transport which               is a highly conserved and fundamental physiological function of all             cells.  Through the isolation of mutants that exhibit altered                   potassium transport, proteins involved in the movement of this                  essential ion across cell membranes can be identified genetically,              and the relationship between the structure and function of                      potassium transporter molecules can be investigated.",
