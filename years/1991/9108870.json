 "awd_abstract_narration": "CICNet, a midlevel network supplying high level connectivity                  to the universities of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation               (CIC) (which includes the universities of Ohio State, Michigan                  State, University of Michigan, Indiana University, University of                Chicago, Purdue University, University of Illinois, Northwestern                University, Universtiy of Wisconsin, University of Minnesota, and               University of Iowa) and establishing cooperative working                        agreements with intrastate networks in its region, will be                      provided funding to support the continued operation of the CICNet               data network.                                                                                                                                                     The primary focus of this project is to improve the                           technological and operational aspects of CICNet and extend and                  expand the value of CICNet and of the many resources to which it                provides access.                                                                                                                                                  The initial award to the University of Illinois for the start                 of CICNet has provided two years of operation during which time                 CICNet has provided high bandwidth connectivity (1.544 milliion                 bits per second) for the midlevel region from Ohio to Minnesota                 to the NSFNET Nationwide Backbone Network.  This renewal outlines               the continuation of the operation of this                                       network as well as the expansion of network information services                with a special emphasis on end-user orientation.***//",
