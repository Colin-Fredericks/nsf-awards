 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Winona              State University for the repair and renovation of the second floor              of Pasteur Hall which houses the Biology Department. This building              was constructed in 1961 and has not been renovated since that time.             The ARFMP grant of $74,484 and $74,484 provided by the grantee as               cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research              training facilities and thus foster the establishment of a research             presence in the Biology Department.  This project will address the              need to improve the current research infrastructure primarily by                means of structural modifications and of upgrading the plumbing and             heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.  The                 increased quantitiy and visibility of scientific experiments that               accrue from this renovation can be expected to expose more students             to scientific research and to have an impact on their perception of             what research is and how it relates to them.                                                                                                                    This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research in                cell and molecular biology and in environmental biology and for                 the training of quality undergraduate students in a department                  with a particular commitment to stimulating nontraditional                      students to choose a scientific career.",
