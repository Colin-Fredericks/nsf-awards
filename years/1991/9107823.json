 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                  will allow the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State                    University at University Park to acquire a time-of-flight                       secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS).  The research                       studies to be performed include the following:  Surface                         Chemistry with TOF-SIMS, Applications of Imaging TOF-SIMS to                    the Study of the Interfaces of Organic Materials, The Use of                    Imaging TOF-SIMS to Screen for Catalytic Antibodies, Synthesis                  and Characterization of Polymer-Trapped Ceramic Nanoclusters,                   Imaging of Neuronal Membranes, Molecular Dynamics Simulations                   of the keV Particle Bombardment Process, Studies Involving                      Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Studies of Nanoscale                          Composites Using Imaging TOF-SIMS.                                                                                                                              A time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS) can                 simultaneously determine the molecular makeup and distribution                  of a surface sample.  It uses a low-dose pulsed beam of primary                 ions to eject secondary ions of atoms and molecules from the                    sample's surface.  These secondary ions are accelerated into a                  TOF spectrometer where the ions separate in time according to                   their kinetic energies and provide mass dispersion information.                 The study of surface contamination of semiconductor devices,                    surface properties of polymer material, and organic residues on                 treated surfaces, as well as studies of biomedical tissues are                  just a few application areas that have benefited from the                       unique capabilities of the TOF-secondary ion mass spectrometry                  technique.",
