 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light scattering photometry is an absolute characterization                     method which can be used to investigate the dilute solution                     behavior of macromolecules and the colloidal properties of                      suspensions, emulsions and dispersions.                                         A light scattering photometer and laser differential                            refractometer will be purchased by the School of Engineering                    at Vanderbilt University.  These complementary instruments                      will both employ Argon Ion lasers (488 nm) with  the                            differential refractometer used to provide optical parameters                   for the scattering measurements.  The light scattering                          photometer will operate over a broad angular and temperature                    range and function in both the static and dynamic modes.  Both                  pieces of equipment will be computer interfaced.  They are                      intended for an interdisciplinary polymer program which                         includes projects involving several academic departments.                       They will be principally dedicated to research in Chemical                      Engineering including the molecular measurement of water                        soluble polymers, kinetic and latex characterization of                         heterophase polymerizations, and in analyses aimed at                           improving the precision of light scattering.  The photometer                    will also be used for engineering education in the laboratory                   component of a graduate polymer course.  Additionally, it will                                                                                                  be applied to the investigation of research areas in polymer                    science and engineering including the conformation of polymer                   chains prior to degradation, the mechanism of polymer                           separation inside a sorbent pore of a Gel Permeation                            Chromatograph, and determination of structure-property indices                                                                                                  to improve the quality of biomaterials such as those used in                    artificial organs.",
