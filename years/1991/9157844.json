 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accelerometers are very useful devices but                                      conventional accelerometers are usually very                                    expensive so their use is still limited, for example, in                        automobiles.  Recently, bulk-micromachined silicon                              accelerometers have been demonstrated but they                                  typically have sensitivity and resolution limitation                            (typically no better than 1 milli-g).  A few years ago,                         a couple of prototype tunneling accelerometers have                             been demonstrated.  They do have much better                                    resolution but they can only be made one by one                                 manually and tedious calibration is necessary.  In                              other words, bulky size, high cost, low throughput, etc.                        will seriously limit their application if not improved.                                                                                                         On the other hand, surface micromachining has                                   recently been developed to fabricate many                                       micromechanical devices such as pin joints, springs,                            sliders, cranks, gears, etc.  It is, therefore, generally                       believed that such technology can also be used to                               make microsensors.  As a result, it is proposed here                            that highly sensitive, low cost, small size,                                    accelerometers can be made combining surface                                    micromachining techniques and tunneling mechanism.                              We proposed to use surface micromachining                                       techniques to integrate a sharp tip, a microspring-                             mass, and an electrostatical feedback together to                               function as a tunneling accelerometer.  Such an                                 accelerometer is estimated to have a resolution of                              better than 1 micro-g, which is very competitive with                           state-of-the-art accelerometers.  Such integrated                               tunneling accelerometer will have very important                                applications for automobile subsystems such as                                  airbag, autosuspension, and navigation.",
