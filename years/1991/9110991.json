 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previously developed methods to compute equilibria for stochastic               overlapping generations economies where agents live a large number              of periods will be applied to address several questions.  Among                 them are the behavior of asset prices and the distribution of risks             across agents in these type of economies.  Another application is               to investigate the implications of changes in the age structure of              the population on intertemporal prices, and on the rate of capital              accumulation.  Finally, a quantitative assessment of the patterns               of international borrowing and lending due to differences in the                demographic structure of nations will allow an evaluation of the                nature of the external deficit.                                                                                                                                 The study will also develop a method suitable to quantitatively                 address heterogeneous, infinitely lived agents economies with                   capital, ideosyncratic and economy-wide shocks to productivity, and             liquidity constraints.  The development of this method will allow               explicit consideration of many issues.  Among them are: checking                the robustness of the findings of real business cycle research to               environments with pervasive liquidity constraints, and studying the             behavior of different wealth and income groups during the business              cycle, and the differential volatility of hours worked across skill             groups.                                                                                                                                                         This project addresses many important issues regarding computable               general equilibrium models that need to be better understood.  The              methods developed can be used to explore issues related to aging                and savings, and the distribution of workers.  This work will                   provide the crucial base upon which important policy issues can be              addressed in the future.",
