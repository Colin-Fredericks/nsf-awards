 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Manders is developing a novel philosophical view of                         mathematical knowledge that long-range intellectual accomplishment              in mathematics consists primarily in making things clear by                     appropriate use of concepts.  Dr. Manders is extending case studies             testing explanations of how conceptual changes affect mathematical              understanding.  The studies compare how given problems are dealt                with in different conceptual settings.  They seek to account for                historically observed differences in understandability in the                   different settings by theoretical models of conceptual settings and             their relationships to each other.                                                                                                                              The studies concern (a) algebraic reasoning in Cartesian geometry               vs. traditional figure=based geometrical reasoning; (b) the meta-               mathematical notion of \"model completion\" as a schematic paradigm               for the historical development of the number concept to include                 real and complex numbers, and for the movement from affine to                   projective viewpoint in geometry; (c) the algebraic notion of                   \"completion of a partial group action\" as a model for projective                closure and conformal compactification.  For example, algebraic                 methods promote clarity in ceratin phases of geometrical problem                solving by allowing one to suppress irrelevant geometric                        information. Figures must by their nature display this information,             whereas algebraic formulas need not.   Such differences may be                  brought out by systematically comparing the functioning of                      algebraic and figure-based representation.  They are expected to                account for many of the historically observed differences between               Cartesian and traditional geometry.",
