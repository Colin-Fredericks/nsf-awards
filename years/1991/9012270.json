 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major finding 15 years ago was that various                              oceanographic parameters respond to orbital (\"Milankovich\")                     forcings in a linear manner. This means that 1) marine                          sediments faithfully record the frequencies of orbital                          patterns, shifted only in amplitude and phase; 2) interaction                   of the several known orbital frequencies results in marine                      patterns that are the sum of all these frequencies. The P.I.                    has recently discovered that Pliocene sediments from the                        eastern equatorial Pacific (DSDP) Site 572) show non-linear                     couplings to the Milankovich band. This means that the marinere                 cord shows evidence of: 1) harmonic distortion, i.e. orbital                    frequency fO is recorded at fO,2fO,3fO, etc,; 2)                                intermodulation distortion, i.e. various orbital frequencies                    both add and subtract to give a complex array of frequencies in                 the marine record.                                                                   Funds have been awarded to expand this search for non-                     linear responses. Because commonly used techniques of time                      series analysis cannot detect anything other than linear                        response signals, bispectrum analysis and auto regressive                       moving average models will be explored as alternative                           techniques. Sensitivity studies will be conducted,                              and the final techniques will be applied to the analysis of any                 of several candidate ODP and DSDP records, using delta O18,                     delta C13, CaCO3, SST, eolian dust of magnetic susceptibility                   as the parameter to examine for orbital forcings.",
