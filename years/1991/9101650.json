 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his research in                   complex differential geometry and nonlinear analysis. He will be                particularly concerned with a study of Kahler manifolds through                 Kahler-Einstein metrics. In the 1950's Calabi asked if one could                find a Kahler-Einstein metric on a compact Kahler manifold with                 positive first Chern class and no nontrivial holomorphic vector                 fields. Tian will try to answer this question by obtaining                      estimates for the associated Monge-Ampere operator on the                       underlying Kahler manifold. The methods involve nonlinear partial               differential equations, compactness arguments, and collapsing of                Riemannian manifolds.                                                                The existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on spaces has become              an important problem in differential geometry. It is related to the             structure of space-time in which the curvature of space-time is                 proportional to the stress field. Spaces in which curvature is                  proportional to distance are called Einstein spaces. The principal              investigator will try to determine if a class of spaces with a                  \"complex\" structure can be given the additional Einstein structure.",
