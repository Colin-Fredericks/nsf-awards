 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two broad topics will be investigated - the synthesis of highly                 reduced carbene complexes of transition metals in negative                      oxidation states, and pericyclic reactions of reductively                       activated aromatic ligands.  The principal objective of the                     studies is to answer three broad questions: 1) What range of                    pi-acceptor ligands is capable of stabilizing complexes of                      metals in negative oxidation states?, 2) How wide is the range                  of accessible complexes for those classes of ligands which do                   prove to be capable of stabilizing negative oxidation states?,                  and 3) Will pi-back-donation of electron density from highly                    reduced metal centers to the (typically unsaturated)                            pi-acceptor ligands activate the ligands towards electrophiles,                 coupling reactions, or other unprecedented reactivity modes?                    An important secondary objective is the development of new                      reactions with potential applications in organic synthesis.                     %%%                                                                             In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                     metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. N. John Cooper                  of the University of Pittsburgh will synthesize and study the                   reactivity of complexes containing transition metals in                         negative oxidation states.  These very unusual and highly                       reactive compounds may have applications in organic synthesis.",
