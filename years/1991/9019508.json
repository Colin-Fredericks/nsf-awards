 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many eukaryotic genes are interrupted by intervening sequences                  which are excised from mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) during pre mRNA              splicing.  The long-term objective of our research is to understand             how pre-mRNA splice sites are accurately and efficiently                        recognized, cleaved and ligated during splicing.  Recognition and               cleavage of 5' splice sites is mediated by U1 small nuclear                     ribonucleoprotein, a sub-assembly of the spliceosome.  The approach             has been to first characterize the structure and function of U1                 snRNP and have shown that the U1 snRNP-specific U1-70K and U1-A                 proteins are sequence-specific RNA-binding protein.  Elucidating                the functions of the various components of U1 snRNP during pre-mRNA             splicing is being planned.  This will involve extending the studies             of U1 snRNP structure, determining the mechanism(s) of sequence-                specific RNA-binding by the U1-70K and U1-A proteins, and defining              the properties of various components of U1 snRNP.  As members of                the RNP sequence domain class of RNA-binding proteins, the U1-70K,              U1-A, and U2-B\" proteins will also be used as models to study this              class of sequence-specific RNA-protein interactions.  The functions             of these snRNP proteins during pre-mRNA splicing may be modulated,              through regulation of the biosynthesis of the human U1-70K snRNP                protein, via alternative splicing of its own pre-mRNA will be                   studied.",
