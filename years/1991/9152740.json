 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Sociology, Queens College, The City                           University of New York will develop an undergraduate laboratory                 using high speed microcomputers and an ethernet network. The                    network will be bridged to the Queens College Academic Computer                 Center Network and from there to NYSERNET, the CUNY University-                 wide Computer and NSFNET. This laboratory will permit the                       department to significantly enhance its curriculum at the                       introductory and advanced level.Three major objectives of the                   project are: 1) Infusing the content of lower level methods and                 statistics courses with 'hands-on' laboratory exercises, thus                   upgrading the quantitative and scientific reasoning skills of                   students, especially those who major in sociology. Many of                      these students are women and many are members of racial and                     ethnic minorities. 2) Providing intensive independent research                  experiences for students considering scientific careers in                      sociology, through small laboratory-based upper level research                  courses closely supervised by senior faculty. Many students                     from the department have gone on to their Ph.D.s at graduate                    schools throughout the U.S. 3) Disseminating the results and                    products of our experience to other sociology and social                        science departments throughout the United States.",
