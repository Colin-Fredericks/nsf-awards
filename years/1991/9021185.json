 "awd_abstract_narration": "Auditory communication requires a sound call emitted by one                     animal to be received as a sensory signal and detected reliably                 by another animal listening.  It is important to know how the                   receiver is matched to the signal in a given species, and how                   congruence can be maintained over generations despite the                       individual variability within a species.  Nowhere is the match                  between signal and receiver more crucial than when the                          communication system is used in mate recognition.  Females                      often use the signal from a calling male to discriminate                        between members of the same species versus other species, and                   if the male's signal does not match the female's detection                      properties he will be ignored as a potential mate.                                                                                                              Neurobiology, behavior, morphology and evolutionary biology                     are combined here to study the \"microevolution\" of                              communication in particular populations of cricket frogs.  The                  advertisement calls of males ready to mate will be quantified                   to see how pitch and timing of their acoustic components differ                 among the populations.  Neurophysiological recording in the                     brain will be used to see how the auditory pathway processes                    call features that characterize the population.  Behavioral                     studies will test whether females respond preferentially to                     calls from their local population.  Variation within a                          population will be analyzed to see how differences affect mate                  choice, to identify sex differences in the communication                        system, and to see how the structure of the calling organ, the                  larynx, may constrain or promote call changes.  Finally,                        genetic relatedness will be assessed biochemically to see if                    populations that are separated but share similar call structure                 reflect similar pressures from habitat constraints on acoustic                  signals, or instead reflect a historical ancestral relation-                    ship.  This work represents a uniquely complete analysis of a                   particular communication system, likely to uncover fundamental                  patterns and processes underlying the neural and morphological                  control and evolution of vertebrate social behavior and                         communication.  Its multidisciplinary scope is likely to produce                a wide impact on many areas of biology.",
