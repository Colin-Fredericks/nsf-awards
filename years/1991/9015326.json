 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research between                                George Bertsch of Michigan State University and                                 Dr. M. Hussein of the University of Sao Paulo,                                  Brazil.  The principal investigators will study the                             theory of nuclear reactions, with applications to                               phenomena under experimental investigation.  In the                             past, they have made studies in parallel but                                    completely independently.  Both Bertsch and Hussein                             have calculated gamma decays of giant resonances;                               both the Michigan State and the Sao Paulo groups are                            now studying fragmentation reactions related to the                             properties of exotic nuclei.                                                                                                                                    It will be productive to continue this work in                                  collaboration to take advantage of MSU's facilities                             and close connections in both the theory and                                    experimental communities.  One of the                                           collaborations, to study pion production from exotic                            beams, has already started.  The aim is relying on                              the experience of both sides on the agreement in                                nuclear structure and reaction theories and to develop                          a consistent and practical theory for the decay of                              the giant resonances.",
