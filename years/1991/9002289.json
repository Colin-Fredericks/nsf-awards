 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in electrical                          engineering to be conducted by Peter Herczfeld of the Center                    for Microwave-Lightwave Engineering (CMLE) at Drexel                            University and Alvaro De Salles of the Center for Studies in                    Telecommunications (CETUC) of the Catholic University in Rio                    de Janeiro.  The scientific areas of the cooperative research                   are the interaction of high frequency electromagnetic and                       light waves in semiconductor devices and fiberoptic sensors.                    Drexel has an active program studying the interaction of                        lightwaves and high-frequency electromagnetic waves in semi-                    conducting materials and devices.  These studies include the                    nonlinear behavior of semi-conductor lasers with external                       cavities and the performance of monolithic microwave integrated                 circuit (MMIC) components under optical illumination.  In                       addition CMLE has an active program in fiberoptic sensor                        devices.  In Brazil, CETUC has well established programs in                     the same technical areas.  At CETUC, research is progressing                    on sensors for the Brazilian power industry.  The proposed                      cooperative work will adapt the methods developed at CMLE for                   voltage and current sensing, which is of interest to CETUC,                     and expand on the basic understanding of modal coupling in                      fibers.  Both experimental and analytic research are planned.                                                                                                   Previous contacts between the researchers at CETUC and CMLE                     have included exchange of scientific information and sample                     devices, exchange of graduate students, visits and lectures                     at each institution and collaboration on scientific articles                    and books.  This work represents the culmination of a                           previous informal cooperation.  The proposed research will be                   a natural extension of present activities and will emphasize                    the overlapping interests of these two collaborating partners                   in the fundamental, generic aspect of the research topics                       identified above.",
