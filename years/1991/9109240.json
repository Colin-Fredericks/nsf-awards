 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Rykiel, Wu, Folse, and Archer propose to build and test                    dynamic, spatially explicit models of vegetation interactions that              permit a mechanistic basis for (1) understanding local spatial                  interactions among individual plants, (2) generating spatial                    processes in succession, and (3) studying how small scale processes             can produce and regulate large scale patterns.  They will use                   vegetation clusters as model ecosystems for developing theory and               simulation models explicitly linking plant and landscape levels of              organization.  The theoretical component of the proposed research               is based on the hypothesis that local (individual and neighborhood)             behavior determines the ecological patterns observed at larger                  scales (community and landscape).  The modeling component involves              development of (a) object-oriented simulation models representing               spatial interactions between individual plants in clusters, and                 between clusters in the landscape, and (b) simplified grid-based                (cellular automata) models of spatial interactions in cluster                   development.  Field data will be collected on leaf area,                        transpiration, growth rate, and root extent for savanna and thorn               scrub vegetation for model parameterization and evaluation.  They               will use the theory, models, and field data to predict the effects              of spatial heterogeneity in nutrient availability on the formation              and growth of vegetation clusters, the dynamics of individual                   clusters, and the interactions among clusters that produce observed             and expected landscape patterns of vegetation and resource                      distributions.  Drs. Rykiel, Wu, Folse and Archer are leaders in                the field of vegetation in cluster development.  The facilities                 available for conducting this research are outstanding.",
