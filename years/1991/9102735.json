 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a U.S.-Italy Workshop on asphaltic                      materials.  The activity is being organized by Professor Paul                   Jennings of Montana State University and Professor Carlo                        Giavarini of the University of Rome.  The subject of the                        workshop will be restricted to the chemical components of                       bitumens and the ways in which the components interact in the                   neat asphalt.  The agenda includes presentation of research                     results and new techniques for achieving such results, and                      allows ample time for discussion and exchange of ideas.                                                                                                         Although asphaltic materials (bitumens) have been used                          extensively around the world for roadway paving, for roofing                    and for other purposes, the chemistry of these materials,                       which determines their behavior, has been poorly understood.                    However, research in this area has been gaining momentum                        rapidly and interchange of information and ideas among                          scientists from different countries will play an important                      role in future efforts.  This workshop will permit a rapid                      exchange of information among the participants, thus                            promoting progress in individual research.  Furthermore, the                    proceedings of the conference, including all presentations and                  transcriptions of discussions, will be published and                            disseminated not only among the participants but also to                        other interested scientists.",
