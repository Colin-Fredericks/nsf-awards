 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of computer vision has dealt mostly with monochrome                   images, leaving the use of color images largely unexplored.                     Because of advances in computer technology and in monochrome                    image processing and interpretation, it is reasonable to begin                  directing more effort toward the incorporation of color                         information into computer vision systems.  New techniques for                   color image enhancement, analysis, and segmentation need to be                  developed that apply directly to the vector pixel values, rather                than simply applying monochrome techniques to the red, green, and               blue component images.  In addition, theoretical models for color               image processing and interpretation need to be developed so that                a unified theory for color computer vision will exist.                                                                                                          Planning activities will start with ascertaining which existing                 techniques can be readily extended to apply to color images and                 which new techniques must be developed.  Also, methods for                      multispectral image analysis will be reviewed in order to                       determine which techniques can be adapted to color images.                      During the planning period, some preliminary analysis of various                techniques will be performed through software implementation.                   This will help determine which methods offer the most promise and               warrant further research.  The result of these planning                         activities will be the formulation of a research project for the                development of specific image enhancement, analysis, and                        segmentation procedures for a color computer vision system.",
