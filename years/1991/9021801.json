 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Tuskegee University for the repair, renovation, and                             reconfiguration of the recently vacated John A. Andrew Hospital                 complex as a replacement for the facilities currently used to                   house the research and research training activities of the                      Departments of Biology, Chemistry, and Computer Science.  The main              portion of this complex to be modified was constructed in 1970 and              has not been renovated since that time.  The replacement and                    relocation are fully justified and cost-effective.  The ARFMP                   grant of $950,000 and $1,300,000 provided by the grantee as cost                sharing will be used to modernize these research and research                   training facilities.  This project will address the need to                     improve the current research infrastructure by reconfiguring the                space, installing adequate heating, ventilation and air                         conditioning (HVAC) and other building systems, and providing                   needed fixed equipment such as laboratory casework, fume hoods,                 and cold rooms.  Bringing biology, chemistry, and computer                      sciences together and also in closer proximity to related                       activities can be expected to enhance collaborations, the                       efficiency of the use of the facilities, and the quality and                    quantity of ongoing research.                                                                                                                                   This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of undergraduate and graduate students.  This                  project will play a significant role in helping Tuskegee                        University to remain a demonstrated leader in the direction,                    inspiration, and training of qualified black students and women                 students and an important resource for bringing them into the                   human resources pipeline in scientific fields.",
