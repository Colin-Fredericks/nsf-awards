 "awd_abstract_narration": "By combining ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface analysis with                       electrochemistry, ex situ studies offer a new, vastly detailed                  route for examining electrochemical phenomena.  This approach                   is applied to the study of methanol and formic acid                             electrocatalysis on single crystal, metal electrodes.  These                    reactions are important in fuel-cell applications, but the                      lack of mechanistic understanding, particularly of spontaneous                  poisoning, inhibits further development.  This work applies                     concepts from gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis to build a                      paradigm for understanding electrocatalytic behavior.  The                      mechanistic details of the reactions, individually and in the                   presence of modifiers, are studied with a combination of UHV                    and electrochemical cross-characterization experiments and                      post-electrochemical analyses in UHV.  The growth modes and                     surface chemistry of metallic and nonmetallic modifiers are                     examined as well.                                                                                                                                               The research directly address the important issues that stand                   in the way of development of direct methanol fuel cells.                        However, of perhaps equal importance to the advancement of                      this important (because of energy resource limitations and                      environmental considerations) technology is the development                     and refinement of the ex situ methodology for the study of                      electrochemical systems, which could have a major impact on                     industrial process work.",
