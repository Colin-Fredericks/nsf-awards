 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in intermediate                  energy nuclear physics between Dr. John Alexander, State                        University of New York at Stony Brook and Dr. Serge Kox,                        Institute for Nuclear Science, Grenoble, France.  The                           objective of the project is to investigate the evolution of                     hot composite nuclei with energy.                                                                                                                               The properties of hot atomic nuclei are of great interest, in                   order to understand fusion and fission processes in stars, in                   the creation of heavy elements, and in the search for the                       possibility of phase transitions in nuclear matter.  Heavy                      ion accelerators make it possible to study many combinations                    of target-projectile pairs over a very wide energy span.   In                   this project, the investigators will carry out a series of                      experiments, using the SARA facility at Grenoble (8-27                          MeV/nucleon) along with the detector arrays EMRIC and AMPHORA                   constructed at the Institute for Nuclear Physics.  For the                      interpretation and analysis of results, reaction model                          computer codes have been written at Stony Brook that address                    the specific and detailed information that can be obtained                      from the EMRIC and AMPHORA arrays.  The small angle particle-                   particle correlation data from EMRIC will probe the reaction                    dynamics by sensing the time intervals between emissions of                     particle pairs.  Data from the large-acceptance (82%) AMPHORA                   array will provide event by event portraits of the set of                       charged particles in individual evaporation cascades. In this                   joint effort, the US scientists will benefit significantly                      from the use of state of the art French facilities not                          routinely available in the US, as well as the opportunity to                    work with a group of physicists who are at the frontier of                      heavy-ion reaction measurements. The French side will clearly                   benefit from the expertise and computer codes developed in                      recent years by the Stony Brook group.  The results of this                     project may yield important new insight into the collective                     properties of highly excited nuclei.",
