 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his study of                      Riemannian metrics and spectral geometry. In particular, he will                consider the following problems: find conditions for the                        solvability of the equation of prescribed scalar curvature on                   spheres, find bounds for the Sobolev constant of a Riemannian                   manifold in terms of its spectral data, and construct extremal                  metrics with respect to functionals arising from spectral                       considerations.                                                                      The research supported by this award generally will attempt to             relate the local geometric information on a manifold or surface                 with global information about the surface. The local information is             given in terms of partial differential equations on the surface and             the global information involves globally defined solutions to these             partial differential equations. The theme of relating local to                  global information is a common one in differential geometry. One of             the locally defined operators to be considered here is the                      Laplacian which is perhaps the most important operator for                      applications to engineering or physics.",
