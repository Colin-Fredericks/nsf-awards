 "awd_abstract_narration": "CATALYST is a three year faculty development program at the                     University of Rhode Island (URI) for high school teachers of                    science, mathematics, and computer science.  It will:                                1.  Train 96 high school science, mathematics, and                                  computer science teachers how to use interactive                                technologies in the classroom.  This 1991-92                                    academic year component will stress hypermedia,                                 intelligent tutoring systems, repurposed videodisc,                             microworlds, coaches, inspectable simulations,                                  computer animation, and automated data collection                               and analysis.  The teachers will learn how to:                                  o  Teach students how to solve scientific problems                                 using the heuristic approach of Polya.                                       o  Manage CAI and video/digital audio projects                                     (including writing, producing, implementing, and                                evaluating them).                                                            o  Use the computer to write multimedia programs.                               o  Deal with different learning styles of students.                             o  Recognize science preconceptions and help                                       students to overcome them                                                    o  Evaluate software and interactive products.                                  o  Use information networks and database.                                       o  Creating instructional materials with commonly                                  available software and microcomputers,                                          workstations, and graphing calculators.                                                                                                             The teachers will finish the program's initial phases with                      projects they design and implement themselves.                                       2.  Select 32 participants to develop an in-depth                                   project.  At least sixteen will attend URI for a                                four week workshop during the summers of 1992 and                               1993.  They will also work at the University for 10                             to 20 percent of the work week during the 1991-92-                              93, and 1993-94 academic year.                                              3.  Evaluate how well the teacher-developed materials                               works with students.                                                        4.  Develop a series of probes and sensors along with                               computer software tools to measure such phenomena                               as heat, temperature, electromotive force, light                                oscillations, and sound.  The teachers will use                                 these tools to produce a number of laboratory                                   experiments.                                                                                                                                           CATALYST relies on resources from several institutions.                         These include intelligent problem solving tutors and                            repurposed videodiscs  from URI, inspectable simulations                        from Appalachian State University, multimedia from the                          Department of Art at San Francisco State University, and                        microcomputers based laboratory experiments from Tufts                          University.  There is sharing of information and materials                      with a parallel project at the University of San Francisco.                                                                                                     Cost sharing equals 186% of the NSF award.",
