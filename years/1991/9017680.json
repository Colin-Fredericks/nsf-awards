 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is a request for renewal of work documenting the              paleoenvironmental history of the glaciomarine Yakataga Formation               in the Gulf of Alaska.  This 5 km thick unit is a potential high-               resolution record of late Cenozoic glacial, climatic and                        depositional history.  This record is being reconstructed on the                basis of detailed physical sedimentologic studies and benthic                   foraminiferal biofacies analysis.  The prior research grant has                 funded detailed studies of extensive Yakataga sections at Yakataga              Reef, Icy Bay and Middleton Island.  These have provided                        preliminary models of glaciomarine depositional processes which                 involve the periodic advance and retreat of tidewater ice margins               across the continental margin.  The present proposal seeks to                   initiate an offshore subsurface study utilizing petroleum                       exploration wells and publically-available seismic lines.  This                 will provide insights into the youngest Yakataga Formation which                does not crop out, and better control on depositional geometries                in the formation.  Once these studies are complete we will be                   better able to \"read\" the depositional and paleoenvironmental                   record of the Yakatage Formation and establish it as a high-                    resolution climatic and glacial record for the late Cenozoic of the             North Pacific.  It will also serve as the basis for increasingly                detailed glaciomarine facies models.",
