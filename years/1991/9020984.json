 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most critical areas where law and medicine intersect is              on medical informed consent.  From a scientific standpoint little               is known about the range of information that should be disclosed                to patients to enhance their ability to make an informed decision.              Both theoretically and methodologically, there is need for an                   analytically based approach to enable such decisionmaking.                                                                                                      Dr. Fischhoff and his colleagues are seeking to develop such an                 approach to disclosure that is applicable to physicians' legal                  obligations to insure informed consent from patients.  Their work               aims to model quantitatively the variation in evaluations of                    possible health outcomes of patients.  The research draws on a new              technique whereby logistic regression is used to explain the                    variable contribution of input information to decision variation                in a Monte Carlo simulation of a model.  This method will produce               an objective, \"reasonable\" range of subjective differences.  These              objective values will then be applied in a decision analysis                    modeling of several medical procedures.                                                                                                                         This study promises important advances.  It will show the strengths             and limitations of the analysis and permit the further development,             generalization, and implementation of this approach within the                  medical-legal setting.  Also, it is an essential precursor to                   examining the ways in which the law can accommodate quantitative                analyses underlying professional disclosure practices.",
