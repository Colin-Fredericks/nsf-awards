 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to expand and improve the                mathematical description and quantitative understanding of                      incremental compounding and bending and processes used in the                   manufacture of compound-curved metal plates from flat sheet stock.              The method is based on differential geometry and finite-element                 methods.  It will provide lofting of accurate boundary curves to                be cut from the flat material, as well as quantitative compounding              instructions and potential feedback control, such that plates can               be formed which are applicable and/or fully conformed to specific               preplanned portions of a designed surface, with minimal or zero                 field trim.                                                                          Three specific areas are addressed:  (1) discovery of more                 efficient and accurate numerical methods for solution of the                    nonlinear finite-element equations;  (2) formulations and solution              of a finite-element characterization of bending, the extrinsic                  geometry of the plate;  and (3) finite-element analysis of residual             membrane stresses introduced during compounding, and quantification             of their effects on the compounding process.",
