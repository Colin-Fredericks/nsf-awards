 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  Under this project, support will be provided                      for a scientist from Sri Lanka, Dr. Srianthie A.                                Deraniyagala, of the Department of Chemistry, University of                     Colombo, Sri Lanka, to work in the laboratory of Dr. Rex                        Pratt of Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT.  The                            research, to be carried out jointly, will seek to study the                     interaction of bacterial enzymes with antibiotics that may                      decrease the latters' effectiveness.  Specifically, a                           combination of secondary and solvent kinetic deuterium                          isotope effects will be employed to determine the structure                     of Beta-lactamase transition states and the extent of their                     stabilization through proton motion.  Extension of the                          experiments to the bacterial DD-peptidase enzymes, the                          targets of Beta-lactam antibiotics, are also planned, to                        further delineate the differences between the                                   Beta-lactamase and DD-peptidase active sites.  A close                          comparison of the results with previously obtained results                      of the serine proteinases will be made, to clarify the                          mechanisms of catalysis employed by these enzymes.                                                                                                              Scope:  The project brings a young, bright researcher from                      Sri Lanka to participate in research with, and learn new                        experimental techniques, from a well established and                            experienced U.S. researcher who has extensive knowledge in                      the field.  This is likely to benefit both scientists, and                      to encourage the expansion of similar work in Sri Lanka in                      the future.",
