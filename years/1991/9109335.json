 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on Congress and on the dynamics of the legislative process             in the United States is hampered by the lack of significant short               term variation in important aspects of the legislative process.                 For example, although the structure of the congressional committee              system is believed to be important in determining the operation of              Congress, the fact that the structure of the committee system has               changed only very little over the past half century makes analysis              of the effects of committee structure difficult to study using                  contemporary data.                                                                                                                                              To compensate for this problem congressional scholars have turned               increasingly to history.  Specifically, by studying congressional               change over longer periods of time it is possible to observe                    greater variation in key concepts and variables.  The problem,                  however, is that systematic and reliable data have not been                     collected on many aspects of Congress for the years prior to about              1950.                                                                                                                                                           This award supports a planning conference of congressional scholars             to study the feasibility of developing a comprehensive, multi-user,             historical data base on congressional structure, process and                    composition.  The conference will involve the leading scholars in               the field and will seek agreement on the types of data that should              be collected, the format a comprehensive data base should take,                 and on the types of questions that could be addresses if these data             were collected.                                                                                                                                                 When completed this project will provide a much better                          understanding of the data needs and opportunities in this important             area of Political Science.",
