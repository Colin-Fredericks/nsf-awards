 "awd_abstract_narration": "This infrastructure award is for the purchase of a network of high              speed workstations.  This network of workstations is to support                 research in artificial intelligence, programming languages, geometric           computing, and fault tolerant computing.  The artificial intelligence           research is concentrated in four areas: machine learning, constraint            satisfaction networks, parallel logic programming, and knowledge                representation.  The research in programming languages involves the             translation of CCS specifications to an implementation language which           provably implements concurrency and provably satisfies real time                constraints.  The research in geometric computing is focused on                 computing higher-degree curves and surfaces, alternate representations          for curves and surfaces, efficient methods for representing geometric           modes, and motion planning.  The research in fault tolerant computing           is concentrated on self-monitoring systems.                                                                                                                     Johns Hopkins University will use its infrastructure grant to improve           the environment for experimental research in computer science,                  information science, and computer engineering.  Artificial                      intelligence is the generic name given to computer based research on            performing actions normally described as \"intelligent actions.\"  Johns          Hopkins researchers will explore learning and reasoning actions.                Languages to instruct computers in their operations have been studied           for many years.  The goal of these languages is to succinctly describe          the desired operation with as little error as possible.  The                    programming language research at Johns Hopkins pursues this goal for            systems that must respond in \"real time\".  Computers are used                   extensively in robots. In order for reasoning to be performed about             the environment in which the robot resides, a mathematical model of             that environment must be constructed.  Johns Hopkins researchers will           be studying how to construct and use better mathematical models.                Finally, the network as a whole will be used as a test bed for                  algorithms to detect faulty computers or links on the network.",
