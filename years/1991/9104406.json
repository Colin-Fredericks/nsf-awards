 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on development of a                        methodology that can be used for optimizing the freshwater                      inflows into bays and estuaries for concurrent, possibly                        conflicting purposes.  The objective is a mathematical                          model that can be used to determine the appropriate                             balance between freshwater inflow required to maintain                          desired levels of water quality in estuaries needed to                          maintain their biological productivity and water needs for                      upland agricultural, municipal and industrial purposes.                         The research to find a general optimization model involves                      incorporation of a hydrodynamic salinity model with                             nonlinear statistical regressions of biological                                 productivity as measured by the fishery harvest from the                        estuary, bay or ocean.                                                                                                                                          This project, involving as it does water quality                                considerations in estuaries at the ocean/land-surface                           drainage interface is jointly supported by the                                  Environmental and the Ocean Systems segments of the                             Environmental and Ocean Systems Program.  Results are                           expected to be useful for engineering design and                                management of amounts and quality of water inflows into                         bays and estuaries for meeting concurrent and possibly                          conflicting requirements such as water supplies for                             agriculture, municipal and industrial needs and the need                        to maintain the biological productivity of estuarine, bay                       and ocean waters.",
