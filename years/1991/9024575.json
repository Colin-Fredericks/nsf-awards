 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fall of communist regimes throughout eastern europe and the                 transition to democracy and private enterprise, there, rank among               the most dramatic and important political and economic developments             of recent decades.  In addition to their obvious international                  significance, these efforts at developing democratic institutions               and market mechanisms offer unique opportunities to better                      understand how democracies and markets arise, how they survive or               why they fail, and how they are related.  This award supports                   innovative research designed to better understand the transition                from authoritarian and socialist regimes to democracy and private               enterprise through controlled comparisons of the ongoing                        transitions in Hungary and Poland.                                                                                                                              Specifically, this project tests two theories of the development                of democracy.  The traditional or structural determinist theory                 holds that the development of democracy invariably requires the                 existence of a variety of social and economic preconditions such                as relatively high levels of economic development and an                        established middle class.  An alternative and more recent theory                holds that there are many different types of democracy and many                 different paths to their achievement.  This social interactionist               view agrees that social structure is important but believes that                the effects of social structure are contingent upon the types of                political institutions that develop and the types of strategic                  choices which political actors make during the period of                        transition.                                                                                                                                                     To test these alternatives, the transitions to democracy in Hungary             and Poland will be compared.  Hungary and Poland represent two                  nations with very different social structures which have followed               similar processes of negotiated rather than revolutionary change                but producing very different institutional and policy outcomes.                 Thus they provide an unusual opportunity to assess the effects of               social structure on the development of democratic institutions and              market mechanisms.                                                                                                                                              The Principal Investigator for this project is a highly talented                young scholar whose previous work in Hungary has provided a rich                data set that will greatly facilitate completion of this important              research.",
