 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to transfer new assessment                          technologies from researchers to education practitioners.                       This would enable curriculum development teams to align                         curriculum and assessment within the classroom, and provide                     teachers the knowledge and skills needed to effectively use                     new assessments embedded within the curriculum.  To                             accomplish this, the project will produce hands-on training                     materials for enhancing teachers' and other educators'                          capabilities to use, and for some to construct, new forms of                    student assessments--such as portfolios and hands-on                            investigations--that are aligned with curricular reform in                      science and mathematics education.  To this end, prototype                      hands-on training materials will be developed and field                         tested.  Prior to developing the prototype materials, the                       project will create new assessments, in order to study the                      steps involved in producing the assessments, and then work                      with teachers and other educators to find out how best to                       transfer new test-development technologies from research                        staff to those involved in classroom and school test                            development.  The final product will be two hands-on                            training packages, one for providing preservice and                             inservice teachers with the knowledge and skills to use new                     assessments and another, building on the first, to provide                      teachers, graduate students in science education,                               supervisors, and other educators the knowledge and skills to                    create and evaluate new assessments.                                                                                                                            The cost sharing will be a minimum of 13% of the NSF                            portion.",
