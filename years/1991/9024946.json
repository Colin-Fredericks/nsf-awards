 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design, simulation, and optimization of complex chemical               processes, whether steady-state or unsteady-state, can be made much             more effective by the exploitation of machines that use advanced-               computer architectures, such as those using vector and parallel                 processing.  However, to take full advantage of such architectures,             the formulation of the process flowsheeting problem, and, more                  importantly, the solution algorithms used to solve these problems,              must be totally reworked.  This is an important challenge and                   opportunity in the area of chemical process design.  By using                   techniques developed for these architectures truly interactive                  design capabilities can be achieved that will greatly enhance the               productivity of the design engineer and thus produce designs that               are safer, more efficient and less costly.                                           Strategies are developed for most effectively taking advantage             of advanced computer architectures for the steady-state and                     unsteady state design, simulation and optimization of complex                   chemical processes using the equation-based approach.  The                      techniques involve new, and sophisticated reordering methods for                the sparse matrix problem that underlies chemical process                       simulation, as well as many other new ideas for the solution of                 these problems.  Such techniques are being implemented on a wide                variety of advanced-architecture machines.",
