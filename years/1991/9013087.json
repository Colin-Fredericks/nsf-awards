 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Walter Meyerhof of Stanford                       University for collaborative research in physics with                           Professor Joerg Eichler of the Hahn-Meitner Institute,                          Berlin, Germany.  Professor Meyerhof and his group at                           Stanford have been studying atomic collision processes at                       high energy, mainly experimentally, in order to understand                      inner-shell electronic and radiative processes occurring                        during an atomic collision.  They have collaborated for many                    years with specialists in Europe and Latin America.  The main                   line of their experimental research is shifting now from the                    intermediate velocity to the extreme relativistic domain, in                    partnership with Dr. Harvey Gould of Lawrence Berkeley                          Laboratory.  In parallel with this experimental work,                           collaboration with theoretical physicists will be essential                     to provide the deep understanding necessary for relativistic                    processes.  Professor Eichler offers crucial theoretical                        expertise in the mechanisms of electron capture and in atomic                   collision processes at relativistic velocities.  To provide a                   good basis for their future work, Professors Eichler and                        Meyerhof are collaborating on a monograph that will discuss                     the theoretical approaches which have been used to date to                      treat relativistic atomic collisions and provide details                        about experimental techniques and results.",
