There is at present no coordinated system for                           retrieving such data or to record new data about as yet                         undiscovered species in the arctic.  The ecology of the                         arctic regions is extremely fragile and susceptible to                          stresses caused by economic development and global                              climate change.  The objective of this workshop is to                           begin laying a baseline of data about arctic ecology for                        subsequent studies of biodiversity and global climate                           change.  The meeting is being organized by Dr. David                            Murray of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and                             Academician Vladimir Sokolov of the Institute of                                Evolutionary Animal Morphology and Ecology of the                               U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences.                                                                                                                                   This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine                                   complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of                              strong mutual interest and competence in the field of                           basic scientific research on the basis of equality,                             reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
