 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kapouleas will study several topics in differential              geometry: constant mean curvature surfaces, harmonic maps, real                 Einstein manifolds, and the classification of surfaces. He will use             a method of \"patching\" to construct constant mean curvature                     surfaces with prescribed topological properties. The \"patching\"                 process will also be used to try to construct new examples of real              Einstein manifolds. The full extent of the usefulness of the                    patching process is not known and one of the goals of the research              is to explore other areas in which this tool might be useful.                        The research supported by this proposal should result in a new             method of obtaining global information from local information. The              standard method up to this point for obtaining global solutions to              partial differential equations on surfaces involved working with                the abstract space of possible global solutions to the equation.                The method to be used in this research involves putting small parts             of solutions together much like one puts together a jigsaw puzzle.              The method has already been successful on one class of problems and             the principal investigator will now try to extend the method to                 other classes.",
