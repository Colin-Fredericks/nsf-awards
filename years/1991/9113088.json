 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to being together                               robust control and algebraic topology.  It is argued that                       such robust control issues as structured singular values,                       multivariable phase margin, Kharitonov's theorem, etc.                          receive their natural and unifying formulation in the                           context of algebraic topology, as formulated by                                 Poincare, Cartan, Eilenberg, and many others.  The                              central mathematical issue is whether the mapping of                            the high dimensional manifold of structured                                     uncertainties into the Nyquist template commutes with                           the boundary.  While in the simple Kharitonov case it                           does, in the over-whelming majority of situations the                           Nyquist mapping does not commute with the boundary.                             However, the simplicial approximation theorem                                   provides us with an approximate Nyquist map that does                           commute with the boundary.  Fast implementation of                              the simplicial approximation theorem opens the road to                          a variety of fast, \"simplicial\" algorithms.  Finally,                           performing some algebra on the simplicial                                       approximation yield the \"topography\" of the stability                           boundary, that can be very complicated.",
