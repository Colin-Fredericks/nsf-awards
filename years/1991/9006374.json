 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jeffrey Thomason is a leading investigator into the                    functional characteristics of the skull and jaw complex in                      mammals.  He has hypothesized that the shape of cranial bones has               evolved, in large part, to resist the tendency to bend when                     chewing forces are applied.  By measuring the biting forces                     exerted during chewing, and approximating the strength of the                   bones using engineering principles based on structural beams, Dr.               Thomason has been able to learn how closely the strength counters               the stress applied to each bone.  This study will be extended to                carnivores with very different body sizes, and to a sample of                   ungulate species.  The generality and precision of Dr. Thomason's               hypothesis will be tested using these results.                                       The proposed research will find a wide audience among                      mammalogists, functional morphologists, evolutionary biologists,                and even medical engineers and orthopedic surgeons.  This                       research will expand our knowledge of the functional performance                of the mammal skull, and will test a fascinating proposal for how               evolution might be guided.",
