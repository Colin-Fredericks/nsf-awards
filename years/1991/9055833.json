 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators, Dr. Judith Miller, Dr. Ronald                      Cheetham, and Dr. John Wilkes, have designed and conducted a novel              freshman biology sequence in which the student take an active role              in learning.  Students work in small groups to solve problems which             they have helped to devise.  Laboratories are individually paced                and culminate in independent investigations.  Philosophy,                       mechanics, subjective results, and partial quantitative results                 support the conclusion that the course has been very successful,                but problems remain.  Under this grant, the principal investigators             will undertake new strategies and tasks to improve efficiency;                  improve individual learning and small group dynamics; upgrade                   laboratory offerings; and disseminate their teaching methods and                materials.  This award will enable them to enhance their course                 offering in order to make it maximally effective for their students             and to make their methods available to other college biology                    teachers.",
