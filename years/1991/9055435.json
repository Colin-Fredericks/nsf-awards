 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michigan State University seeks funds for a three-year                          program to promote the improvement of the teaching of                           mathematics to middle school minority students.  This will                      be accomplished through a three-week summer workshop for                        Professional Development Teams of middle school mathematics                     teachers and support people (secondary or college                               mathematics teachers, supervisors or administrators) from                       eleven urban school districts in Michigan.  Current                             exemplary materials in the teaching of algebra, geometry and                    visualization, probability and statistics, and contributions                    of African-Americans to mathematics will be used.                               Participants my earn six hours of graduate credit for the                       summer workshop. School year follow-up activities will                          include two, one-day conferences and two visits by staff                        members to each of the school districts.                                                                                                                        Each year 45 middle school mathematics teachers and support                     people will be enhanced and expected to return to their                         schools as teacher-leaders to enhance an additional 225                         second-wave teachers.  In all 810 teachers and support                          people should be enhanced during the lifetime of the                            project.  Michigan State University's cost-sharing will                         account for 13% of the NSF budget.                                                                                                                              Reaching, teaching and retaining minority students in                           mathematics is an NSF and indeed a national goal of the                         highest priority. This project has the potential of                             providing a prototypic model for an in-service delivery                         system capable of empowering teachers to achieve this goal.",
