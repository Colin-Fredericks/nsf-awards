 "awd_abstract_narration": "A laboratory is being developed for the purpose of conducting                   experiments and demonstrations on the principles of plasmas and                 plasma processes.  The RIT facility is well equipped with tools                 for the production of integrated circuit chips.  This facility                  includes plasma etching equipment, but it is heavily automated                  and mechanically inflexible, making it difficult to use for                     demonstrations and experiments.  This project will provide                      demonstrations and experiments designed to improve student                      understanding of plasma formation, plasma etching, and                          sputtering.  The major components of the apparatus are (1) the                  plasma chamber (2) vacuum pumping system and (3) gas flow                       controls.  The assembled apparatus will be interfaced with                      existing plasma diagnostic instruments for use.  Laboratory                     demonstrations are planned to show the spectra of the plasma                    light emission, the chemical species in the plasma itself with                  and without etching, the sputtering phenomenon, and the various                 effects of parameters such as pressure, feed gas composition,                   Ac vs. DC power, and electrode spacing.",
