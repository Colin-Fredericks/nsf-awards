 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to evaluate competing models of                        biogeography of freshwater fishes and land vertebrates in the                   Caribbean islands.  Its novel aspect is that it will emphasize data             from two sources that are critical to the problem, but which have               been neglected:  the Tertiary fossil record and the island of Cuba.             The investigators' recent successes in discovering Tertiary                     vertebrates in the West Indies demonstrate that a significant and               relevant fossil record can be recovered.  Cuba is of particular                 importance because this island constitutes one-third of the land                surface of the Antilles, yet its biota is known in only a                       rudimentary way.                                                                To maximize results, the investigators will prospect for fossils                in both Quaternary and Tertiary contexts in Hispaniola and Cuba.                Major goals are (1) to increase sample sizes of poorly known taxa               and to prospect for heretofore unknown taxa; (2) to begin a program             of dating to document when the Quaternary fauna of large animals                went extinct; (3) to establish the nature of pre-Quaternary                     biodiversity in the Greater Antilles; (4) to utilize ancient                    biodiversity as a means for evaluating the comparative importance               of dispersal and vicariance (i.e., plate tectonic events) in                    formation of the Antillean fauna; and (5) to develop human                      resources in the Dominican Republic in order to enhance local                   ability to study and conserve biodiversity.  These goals are                    complementary to the investigators' general program of                          investigating causes and consequences of reduction in biodiversity              on island and in islandlike settings.",
