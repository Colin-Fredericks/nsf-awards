 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observations suggest that deep overpressured sediments in the                   U.S. Gulf Coast Sedimentary Basin are expelling porewaters                      vertically near the flanks of some salt domes.  The project will                numerically model flow fields, brine plumes and thermal anomalies               that may result around generic salt domes by this process.  The                 numerical modeling will incorporate the effect of dewatering a                  thick overpressured sedimentary section deeper than 3 to 4 km,                  with fluid expulsion preferentially upward near the flanks of the               domes.  The modeling will also incorporate the effect of                        instabilities induced by porewater density gradients due to                     salinity and temperature variations.  In parallel, subsurface                   salinities, temperatures and pressures will be mapped in vertical               cross-sections across eight salt domes in the U.S. Gulf Coast,                  using borehole logs to determine whether basin dewatering is                    manifested by brine plumes and thermal anomalies.  The proposed                 work may help explain the origin of 1)heavy metal sulfide                       deposits and diagenetic minerals precipitated above or on the                   flanks of salt domes, at temperatures tens of degrees above that                of host sediments, and 2)perched brine plumes above the salt                    domes, gravitationally unstable by virtue of their high density.                The work proposed here may also shed some light on mechanisms for               hydrocarbon migration because hydrocarbons often occur on the                   flanks of salt domes above overpressed sediments.",
