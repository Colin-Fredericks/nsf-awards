 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the question of how chromatin is                     organized in the eukaryotic nucleus, by examining a novel                       hypothesis.  The hypothesis is that proteins associated with the                telomeres, or ends, of chromosomes (telomeric proteins, or TP)                  are nuclear lamins, which in turn are members of a large group of               proteins called intermediate filaments (IF).  Their ability to                  assemble and disassemble into filaments would then be responsible               for maintenance of nuclear organization.  The organism to be used               in these studies is the hypotrichous ciliate Euplotes eurystomus,               which is particularly advantageous because of the unusually short               lengths of individual chromosomal elements in the macronuclei,                  resulting in approximately 100,000,000 telomere-bearing DNA                     pieces, in which the telomeric DNA sequences are all the same.                  Furthermore, the macronucleus contains clearly defined regions of               condensed, dispersed, and replicating chromatin.  The higher                    order organization which determines the structure of each of                    these functional regions is not known.  These properties make                   Euplotes an excellent system for the study of telomeres and                     eukaryotic nuclear structure and function.  The experiments                     proposed for this study involve characterization of TPs by                      cloning the gene and determining its sequence.  The sequence will               be compared with sequences of known IFs.  Immunofluorescent                     localization and STEM mass determination will be used to                        determine TP nuclear sites and stoichiometry with DNA.  In situ                 electron microscopic analysis and immunolocalization will be used               to characterize the 10 nm filaments.  Reconstitution experiments                will be performed to determine factors which affect chromatin                   organization.                                                                                                                                                   It is expected that this study will clarify one of the functions                of telomeres and the role of lamins in organizing chromatin                     structure in a eukaryotic nucleus.  Thus, the project addresses                 one of the central issues of cell biology, namely, the                          architectural organization of the genome within the nucleus.",
