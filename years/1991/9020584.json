 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year collaborative project between                Professor Robert F. Curl, Department of Chemistry, Rice University,             and Professor Leon F. Phillips, Department of Chemistry, University             of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.  The activity takes place             under the U.S.-New Zealand Cooperative Science Program.  The                    scientists will cooperate in a study of the reactions of several                small free radicals (transient, reactive chemical species such as               C2H, HCO, and CH2CN) with oxygen atoms.  Such a study is relevant               both to understanding aspects of the chemistry of the interstellar              medium, as well as the reactions taking place in various combustion             processes.  By measuring the rate constants of these radical-atom               reactions, and in some cases carrying out spectroscopic studies to              identify reaction products, the scientists expect to contribute to a            greater understanding of these reaction systems.  The radicals will             be produced by excimer flash photolysis of suitable precursor                   molecules.  The oxygen atoms (and later, other atoms and OH) will be            generated in a discharge flow system, and allowed to react with the             radicals.                                                                                                                                                       Both the U.S. and New Zealand research groups have experience in                this area of research, involving flash photolysis, infrared                     spectroscopy, and the use of laser probes.  Professor Phillips and              his colleagues at Canterbury University have focused primarily on               the chemical kinetics of these reactions, and have developed                    experimental techniques for carrying out such measurements, including           methods for measuring the concentrations of atoms.  Professor Curl              and his group at Rice have emphasized high resolution infrared                  spectroscopy as well as kinetic studies.  Exchange visits by the                principal investigators will serve to develop the capability for atom-          radical kinetic studies at Rice and to enhance the spectroscopic                analysis strengths at Canterbury.",
