He will do                 so by examining the number of Schottky-Frenkel defects in natural               quartz using electron spin resonance spectroscopy, then                         determining the age of the quartz via improved uranium-thorium                  dating techniques, thereby establishing the rate of accumulation                of the defects.  Through annealing experiments a study also will                be made of the thermal stabilities and mean lives of the defects;               this in turn could provide a basis for a geologically useful                    geochronometer.  Since quartz is a common minerals, development                 of this tool could have wide application, and would be                          particularly useful for rocks in which other methods cannot be                  applied.  The understanding of defects in quartz also will                      benefit the semiconductor industry.",
