 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an experimental and theoretical study of the                       evolution of biochemical characters which are the end results of                metabolic pathways.  The experimental system focuses on the                     maintenance of lipid glycogen stores in the fat body of                         Drosophila melanogaster.  Dr. Clark has devised means of                        quantifying lipid and glycogen storage, along with the activities               of other enzymes.  Large-scale quantitative genetic studies of                  these traits has shown extensive genetic variation in both lipid                and glycogen storage, and that the variation is in part                         explainable by the variation in activities of associated enzymes.                    Two experiments will be performed.  The first experiment                   examines the rate at which spontaneous mutations affecting                      storage and enzyme kinetic characters accumulate.  Mutations that               accumulate on a single chromosome can be isolated and retained.                 Over a 50 generation period (each generation takes about two                    weeks) series of characters, including lipid and glycogen                       storage, will be assayed.  Rates of mutation for these complex                  traits, and for the correlated effects of these mutations will be               estimated.  Only a few studies have estimated mutation rates for                quantitative characters, and none of them have an underlying                    mechanism to be tested.  In order to understand how quantitative                traits evolve, good estimates of this sort are necessary.  The                  proposed research will provide such estimates.                                       Results of these studies may also find application in the                  field of pest management, because positive selection acting on a                trait like lipid storage is not too unlike selection imposed by                 application of a pesticide.  Response can either be by a specific               detoxification, or by complex pathways involving absorption and                 excretion.  As described in one of Dr. Clark's papers, it is also               relevant to artificial selection regimes that are imposed on                    growth and fat contents of a number of agriculturally important                 animals.  The correlated responses to selection can only be                     understood in light of the allometric relations among traits,                   which are to a large part genetically determined.",
