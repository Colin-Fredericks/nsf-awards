 "awd_abstract_narration": "A pattern modeling techniques for representing,                                 analyzing, and classifying features in data sets                                resulting from fluid dynamics and combustion                                    diagnostics research, with particular emphasis on                               turbulent flows will be developed.  The primary                                 thrust of the research is directed toward a two                                 component model for flow fields; one being                                      oriented along the major direction of anisotropy,                               describing the large scale flow; the other being a                              residual pattern representing the independent small                             scale flow structures.  The separation into global                              and localized flows facilitates subsequent                                      identification and tracking of features such as                                 eddies.  Significant data compression will be                                   achievable due to the decorrelation of the flow                                 patterns.                                                                                                                                                       Low level image processing techniques will be                                   developed to meet the challenges posed by the                                   unconventional properties of fluid imagery.  A                                  method for low level image segmentation based on                                a topographic classifier will be investigated.  In                              addition, orthogonal transforms for further                                     compression of the two component flow model will                                be researched.                                                                                                                                                  Data acquired from established laboratories will be                             used to test our modeling strategy.  Spatially and                              temporally resolved 2D data sets will be used to                                extend our previous work in feature detection and                               tracking experiments.  We expect the proposed                                   work will meet some of the needs voiced by the                                  combustion and heat transfer community                                          concerning the automation of computer analysis                                  techniques for large fluid flow data sets.",
