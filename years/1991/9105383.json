 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central property of living systems is rhythmic periodic                       activity, particularly circadian rhythms which are daily cycles.                It is not yet clear what mechanisms entrain and regulate the                    occurrence and timing of these oscillations.  The primary                       environmental signal for circadian rhythms is the change in light               intensity associated with dawn and dusk, but the \"circadian                     photoreceptors\" that mediate these responses are still poorly                   understood.                                                                                                                                                     This project is pilot work to try to get information on this                    mechanism by using a new marking technique that labels pathways                 in the brain.  This marker will allow visualizing the circuit                   that connects the cells that receive the important light stimulus               to the cells in the brain that regulate the circadian rhythm.                   One particular strain of mutant mice has been found to be missing               key cellular elements in the eye, yet still showing a photically                driven rhythm.  The pathway in this mutant will be compared to                  that in normal mice to clarify how the light information gets to                the brain.  If this novel marking technique can be made to work                 well, the results will be very important to visual science,                     chronobiology, and neuroscience in general.",
