 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to further our understanding of               the ontogeny of hematopoietic stem cells and their contribution to              the developing thymus.  This will be accomplished by experimentally             manipulating embryonic stem cells followed by injection of these                stem cells into intact, cytogenetically distinct larval hosts.                  The contribution of the injected stem cells to the developing                   hematopoietic system will be monitored using flow cytometry.  The               results of these experiments will indicate when lymphoid precursors             differentiate during embryogenesis and if there are differential                contributions from embryonic stem cell compartments to the                      developing thymus and other peripheral hematopoietic tissues.  The              commitment of undifferentiated mesoderm to hematopoiesis appears                to be associated with the expression of a surface molecule which                may be a member of the Leukocyte Common Antigen family of protein               tyrosine phosphatase receptors.  It is important to establish the               functional role and phylogenetic conservation of this family of                 signal transduction molecules.                                                                                                                                  Although Xenopus is a phylogenetically primitive vertebrate, many               aspects of its hematopoietic and immune systems are similar to more             recently evolved species.  Thus the proposed investigations of the              immunobiology of this organism may provide useful insights into                 both the ontogeny and evolution of vertebrate defense mechanisms.",
