 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Robert Warner, Marine Science Institute, University of                          California at Santa Barbara and Dr. Francois Wernerus,                          Staresco Marine Laboratory, Calvia, Corsica. The objective                      of the project is to study protandrous fishes (those which                      change sex from male to female) to test theories of sex                         allocation.                                                                                                                                                     Evolutionary ecologists have long been interested in the                        phenomenon of sex change in fishes.  Within this group the                      patterns of sexuality show extreme variety, and this                            variety has often been used to explore the adaptive                             significance of sex allocation. Sex allocation theory deals                     with the evolutionary dynamics of sexual expression:  sex                       ratio, hermaphroditism and related topics.  Ever since this                     theory began to develop in the mid-seventies, it has been                       pointed out that there is a critical need to document the                       mating systems of species that are protandrous.  Theory                         predicts that these species should have mating systems in                       which mating occurs in random pairs or small groups, such                       that there is a size advantage in reproduction accrued by                       small males relative to small females.  The investigators                       propose to test these predictions by assessing size-specific                    mating success and mating group size in four sparid fishes                      common in the Mediterranean.  Two of these species are                          protandrous, one changes sex in the opposite direction, and                     one does not change sex.  Comparisons between these species                     will offer a powerful test of theory.  The research will be                     carried out at the Staresco Marine Laboratory in Corsica,                       which is a major center for research in marine behavioral                       ecology.  The research will benefit from the theoretical                        expertise of Dr. Warner and the experimental experience of                      Dr. Wernerus.",
