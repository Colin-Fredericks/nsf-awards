 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Drosophila male accessory gland is a model system in which to               address issues of cell type specification and of the fate and                   function of molecules delivered to the female during mating. Dr.                Wolfner proposes to continue her developmental and functional                   studies of genes expressed in the accessory gland. First, she                   will investigate cell type specific gene regulation in the                      tissue. She will examine promoter sequences for their role in                   cell type and mating stimulated gene expression. She will also                  examine juvenile hormone effects on the mating stimulated                       expression of accessory gland genes. Second, using an accessory                 gland promoter fused to sequences encoding and intracellular                    toxin, she will ablate specific cells of the accessory gland in                 order to directly determine the functions of each cell type.                    Third, she will focus on the fates of individual accessory gland                products, including representative prohormone like molecules and                representative small peptides. She will determine their targets                 in the mated female and the processing events important for their               function. Fourth, to define the function of individual accessory                gland products, she will use genetic methods to either introduce                or eliminate specific accessory gland products. She will examine                the consequences of these genetic alterations on the altered                    flies or on their mates. These studies will correlate specific                  molecules with behavioral and reproductive functions. These                     results will also establish the basis for production of those                   molecules in the male and for their processing and utilization in               the female.",
