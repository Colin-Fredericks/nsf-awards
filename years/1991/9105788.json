 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fine-grained sediments are thought of as barriers to                       subsurface fluid flow, but non-marine mudstones in the early                    Mesozoic Newark Supergroup of eastern North America contain an                  abundance of coarsely crystalline authigenic minerals.  These                   mudstones also display depositional cycles on several scales that               reflect paleoclimatic fluctuations and provide the means for very               precise stratigraphic correlation.  This is a detailed petrographic             study of the authigenic minerals in the Newark mudstones on a                   regional scale to determine how they vary as a function of                      stratigraphic position, as well as other important factors such as              geographic location, depositional environment, and proximity to                 igneous intrusions.  By working closely with a number of other                  specialists, particularly Dr. Joseph Smoot of the U.S.G.S. Branch               of Sedimentary Processes, we will be able to use a number of                    different analytical techniques to attack this problem.  The                    results will shed light either on 1) how groundwater varies in the              shallow subsurface as a function of long-term climatic fluctuation,             or 2) how and why mudstones can served as conduits for late                     diagenetic fluid flow.  Either way, they should provide important               new insights in a variety of areas, e.g. the formation of sediment-             hosted ore deposits.",
