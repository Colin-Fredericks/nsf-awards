 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop a                  unified approach to seismic hazard and risk evaluation.  This                   objective will be achieved through the following tasks: 1) Advances             on segmentation models of faults will provide the basis for                     developing spatially dependent earthquake occurrence models which               have not been previously considered.  Additional information of the             state of stress and strain release rates along faults will aid in               the development of key parameters for such a model.  2) A                       geophysical ground motion simulation model will be combined with                the earthquake occurrence model for site hazard estimates.  The                 normal mode method was successfully used in a previous NSF-                     supported research project.  Other methods such the ray tracing,                elasto-dynamic Green's functions, and empirical Green's functions               will be reviewed to determine their suitability for implementation.             3) Ground motions simulated under task 2 will be for firm ground                conditions.  To reflect the effect of local soil conditions on the              simulated ground motions, a one-dimensional linear soil will be                 sued to predict motions at the ground surface.  4) The damage                   potential of structures will be represented through a global damage             index which reflects the overall structural behavior.  However, a               damage index for structural components or subassemblies will be                 developed in terms of the ratio of the maximum response parameter               to a cumulative response parameter.  A measure of the energy                    dissipation of the structure through stiffness degradation will be              used to define this index.",
