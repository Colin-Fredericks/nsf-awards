 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major task for the history of science is to understand how                    science rose and became such a driving force in the transformation              of our culture.  This project makes it clear that the rise of                   modern science in the Scientific Revolution was not simply a                    phenomenon connected to the rejection of the Ptolemaic system and               its eventual replacement by the Newtonian theory of gravitation.                The revolution went beyond this narrower scientific achievement to              lay the foundation for a systematic study of nature.  Such a study              required the observer of nature to search for regularities and                  natural laws.  Dr. Park, with her collaborator, Dr. Lorraine J.                 Daston, are seeking to document and analyze changing views of                   natural law and natural order in Western culture during the period              broadly defined as the Scientific Revolution.  They are tracing the             shift in scientific writing from a view of nature that emphasized               the anomalous and the bizarre (monstrous births, celestial                      apparitions, unusual meteorological phenomena, exotic plants and                animals) to a view that privileged the typical and the regular.                 They argue that the former view, which grew out of both the new                 discoveries of the age of European exploration and the focus on                 portents and prodigies associated with the religious struggles of               the Reformation, represented--despite its unfamiliarity--a critical             phase in the consolidation of the new science.  Their principal                 sources are the works of sixteenth and seventeenth century writers,             but they are also drawing on non-scientific sources--literary,                  legal, and artistic--to relate these developments to other aspects              of contemporary culture.",
