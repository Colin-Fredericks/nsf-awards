 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year of a three year continuing award.  To plan               in complex, large-scale tasks requires elaborate and costly                     knowledge engineering and programming to design and implement                   task-specific planners.  General planning methods, on the other                 hand, apply only to small constrained tasks because of the                      inherent combinatiorial search.  Although some worthy inroads                   have been made by modern planners, such as SIPE, to combine                     general planning methods with hand-crafted domain heuristic, This               research considers a different alternative:  focused machine                    learning of control knowledge to guide search.  In particular,                  the fully-implemented PRODIGY planner presents the ideal                        substrate on which to investigate multiple learning methods.                    Previously explanation-based learning was successfully integrated               in PRODIGY.  This research addresses automated acquisition of                   abstraction spaces for hierarchical planning, case-based learning               with derivational analogy, and their synergistic integration.                   Proper abstractions in partially-decomposable domains provide                   major performance improvements, and automated abstraction                       eliminates the bottleneck of laborious hand-coded abstraction.                  Derivational analogy provides and extremely flexible case-based                 replay mechanism, falling back to general planning when solution                to subgoals do not transfer.  Together, both methods should prove               even more effective, with abstraction providing the key indices                 for case-based memory search (those features that cannot                        abstracted away, such as bottleneck points or roots of dependency               networks), and derivational analogy speeding up search within                   abstraction spaces.  Through this automated acquisition of                      control knowledge, planners will be able to solve increasingly                  complex planning domains.",
