 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of general equilibrium with incomplete markets (GEI)                 studies the pricing of securities and commodities, and the                      interactions of perfectly competitive asset markets and commodity               markets in determining consumption and investment.  Since                       financial                                                                       economics is fundamentally concerned with the pricing of                        securities, and since macroeconomics is fundamentally concerned                 with the real effects of monetary assets, the GEI model provides                a framework for a microeconomic analysis that touches a large                   number of different fields.  The purpose of this project is to                  extend the theory of GEI to incorporate money, production, and                  default with asymmetric information.                                                                                                                            The contributions of this project are important because many                    phenomena that cannot be described in the traditional                           Arrow-Debreu                                                                    model come to light in these incomplete asset markets model.                    These                                                                           include the distinction between real and financial assets, the                  limitations for understanding local uniqueness and efficiency of                representative agent and single commodity models, the importance                of diversification, the dependence of asset prices on covariances               and not variances, the \"random walk\" or martingale property of                  asset prices, the relevance or possible irrelevance of corporate                financial policy, the rationale for lenient bankruptcy and                      default                                                                         penalties, the ambiguity of firm objectives, and a positive role                for government redirection of private investment and risk taking                decisions.",
