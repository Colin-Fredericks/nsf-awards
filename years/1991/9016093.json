 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in physics                       between Dr. John Weiner, University of Maryland, and Dr.                        Francoise Masnou-Seeuws, Laboratory for Atomic and Molecular                    Collisions, Orsay, France.  The investigators propose a                         cooperative program in which experiments (on the US side) and                   theory (on the French side) will combine to advance understand-                 ing of the dynamics of ultracold collisions in elementary                       processes.                                                                                                                                                      Dr. Weiner and his research group are currently carrying out                    experiments on associative ionization collisions in alkali                      atomic beams.  They have performed measurements of reaction                     probability as a function of collision velocity, excited-                       state alignment and orientation, and optical-field intensity                    over collision temperatures, ranging from several hundred                       degrees Kdown to less than 1 mK.  These results must be                         interpreted in terms of the very long-range behavior of                         potential curves at internuclear separations from several                       hundred to more than a thousand atomic units.  Furthermore,                     close coupling theories of inelastic collisions are indispen-                   sible to a proper description of the scattering event.  Dr.                     Masnous-Seeuws, a recognized world authority in these areas,                    and her theory group at Orsay, will apply their expertise to                    a thoroughgoing interprestation of the experimental results.                    The combined effort will lead to a clear understanding of                       chemical bond-forming mechanisms at ultracold temperatures.",
