 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objectives of the project follow two themes:  1)                       the collection and assessment of several hundred life                           science microcomputer software programs for use by hearing                      impaired students, including examination of the differences                     and similarities between hearing and hearing impaired                           students using the same programs 2)  the dissemination of                       information about the results of these assessments.                                                                                                             These objectives are closely associated with the objective                      of increasing the population of qualified hearing impaired                      people going into the field of science.  By encouraging the                     use of microcomputers in the life of sciences, students in                      the 1000 deaf institutions/programs will benefit from the                       use of good quality software.                                                                                                                                   The project will use as subjects and evaluators hearing                         impaired students and professional working with these                           students.  The assessments will be made at Gallaudet                            University, selected schools for the deaf and some                              mainstreamed hearing impaired programs.                                                                                                                         The assessment will not only select the best programs for                       the hearing impaired but it will determine if the results                       may be generalized from the deaf to the hearing population.                     As data is gathered on these assessments, a wide                                dissemination effort will provide information to the science                    education community on preferred software programs for both                     the hearing impaired and the hearing population.",
