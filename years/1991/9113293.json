 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in Ecological and Social Science Challenges of                   Conservation at Cornell University.  The faculty group is a                     mixture of senior and junior investigators who come from a                      variety of disciplinary backgrounds, but share a common interest                in the ecological, economic and social aspects of conservation.                 The funds will provide stipends for graduate students and will                  defray part of the cost of the trainees' research and of needed                 technical assistance.  In addition, funds will be used to                       purchase equipment to be used by trainees and to bring                          investigators from other research and academic institutions to                  the campus for an annual workshop on conservation.  Institutional               commitments will allow the participation of additional numbers of               graduate students and of undergraduates, and will also defray a                 portion of the costs of equipment, of technical assistance and of               the workshop.                                                                                                                                                   One of the serious problems for conservation efforts is the                     recurring cycle of poverty and environmental degradation found in               many regions of the world.  Common elements of the cycle are                    population expansion which stimulates agricultural expansion onto               marginal lands, expanded fuelwood requirements, and consequent                  soil degradation and species extinction.  This training program                 will focus on two contrasting socioecological settings in the                   Dominican Republic and Costa Rica and will make use of existing                 institutional arrangements and research activities.  These                      activities examine demography and population growth, the                        interaction of natural and agricultural systems, soil                           conservation, education and management in biosphere reserves, and               related ecology studies.",
