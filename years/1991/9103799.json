 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rust fungi are some of the most devastating plant pathogens.               Research efforts have therefore focused on the genetic basis for                resistance to the pathogens and on other methods of control.                    However, by focusing on the hosts, we have learned very little                  about the pathogens themselves.  The proposed research uses an                  extraordinary case of rust induced floral mimicry to explore the                consequences of insect mediated gamete transfer by these fungi.                 Because this system appears to be highly evolved, it is ideal for               studying the importance of insect-interactions for the evolution                of the rust fungi.  First, whether the mimicry is an evolved                    system, or whether it is merely the result of an accidental                     combination of host morphology and fungal hormones, will be                     examined.  Next how important this extreme case of mimicry is for               these particular fungi, that is, does the mimicry increase                      visitation by insects, and does increased visitation matter to                  the reproductive success of the fungi, will be assessed.  Insects               are known to transfer gametes of rusts, but how necessary they                  are under natural conditions is not well understood.  Finally,                  the possibility that these flower-mimic fungi may affect the                    reproductive success of co-occurring true flowers, either by                    competing for pollinators or by attracting a larger pollinator                  population will be explored.",
