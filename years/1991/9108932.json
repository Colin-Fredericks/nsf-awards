 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scales of electronic devices                                                are approaching the level where                                                 quantum mechanical effects are                                                  becoming important.  From a                                                     practical point of view, the                                                    reduction of device size has a                                                  direct impact on switching speed                                                and power consumption.  A general                                               numerical procedure will be                                                     developed to solve the multi-                                                   dimensional time-dependent and -                                                independent Schrodinger equation.                                               The former is solved using an                                                   efficient Alternative Direction                                                 implicit technique coupled with a                                               Fourier transform of the quantum                                                mechanical correlation function to                                              solve the latter.  The algorithm is                                             also readily extended to include                                                the presence of an external                                                     magnetic field.                                                                                                                                                 The power of the technique will be                                              demonstrated by applying it to                                                  several problems of relevance.                                                  First, the resonant tunneling of                                                wavepacket in two-dimensional                                                   structures will be investigated to                                              assess the dependence of the                                                    tunneling time on the angle of                                                  incidence, the electron wavenumber,                                             and the roughness of the interfaces                                             in a typical heterostructure.                                                   Second, the propagation of                                                      wavepackets through crossed wires                                               geometries in the presence of an                                                external magnetic field will be                                                 studied to better understand the                                                origin of the quenching of the                                                  quantum Hall effect.  Third, the                                                propagation of wavepacket in                                                    Electrostatic Aharanov-Bohm                                                     interferometers will be studied to                                              assess the feasibility of newly                                                 proposed Quantum Interferometers                                                Transistors.  The algorithm will                                                also be used to calculate the                                                   quantum-confined Stark shifts for                                               both electrons and holes and the                                                excitonic states in two-dimensional                                             quantum-confined structures, and                                                important step towards the                                                      characterization of the optical                                                 properties of these structures.                                                 The proposed algorithm has also                                                 potential applications in the field                                             of optoelectronics.  The developed                                              ADI scheme will also be used as an                                              alternative to the Beam Propagation                                             Method (BPM) to solve the Fresnel                                               wave equation, and applied to the                                               characterization of light                                                       propagation through various Rib                                                 waveguides and graded index optical                                             fibers.",
