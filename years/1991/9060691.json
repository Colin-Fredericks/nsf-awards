 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laser technicians are currently trained by about 25 programs                    situated in Community Colleges across the United States.  The                   students are goal-oriented and practical with a modest                          background in mathematics and science.  Curricula usually                       consist of a nearly equal mix of laboratory experiments and                     class room lectures.  In general, Laser Electro Optical                         Technology (LEOT) students seem to be similar to the students                   who take algebra-based physics at college.  Beginning Physics                   students have and finds that they confuse important concepts such               as position and velocity or velocity and acceleration.  Additional              work shows that there is also confusion regarding optical systems.              The concepts taught in the LEOT programs are similar to, but more               complex than, those covered in a algebra-based physics  course.                 They are further obscured by the difficulty the students have with              the mathematical computations.  No work has been conducted to                   identify conceptual difficulties in the LEOT area nor to devise                 practical approaches to overcoming them.  It is quite evident that              they must exist and that they limit the student's understanding of              the material just as they do in the physics curriculum.                                                                                                         Oregon Laser consultants proposes to study ways in which                        computer based ray trace program and spread sheets can be                       incorporated into the current LEOT curricula to model the                       concepts that cause these difficulties.",
