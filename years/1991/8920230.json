The Director of the Center will be Professor                Aravind K. Joshi.                                                                                                                                               The Center for Research in Cognitive Science unites a diverse and               richly interconnected group from many traditional disciplines                   (computer science, linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, and                    psychology).  The goal of the research is to understand the                     processes and mechanisms by which human beings acquire knowledge                about their environment, store and retrieve that knowledge,                     communicate it to others, and apply it to carry out actions and                 manipulate their environment.                                                                                                                                   The research is organized into three separate but highly                        interrelated themes:  perception and action, language learning,                 and language processing.  Research in the area of perception and                action spans the processes involved in the first stages of visual               and auditory representation of spatial and spectral information,                to higher order representations of more complex attributes, to                  the storage and retrieval of such representations by the organism               as they are used in goal-oriented actions.  The study of language               learning focuses on how children develop the abstract                           representations of language on the basis of their visual and                    auditory perceptions.  The research in language processing                      combines investigation of formal systems with investigation of                  computational models, all in the context of empirical study of a                wide range of natural languages.                                                                                                                                Significant features of the perception and action research are                  its increasing fidelity to actual neural computation and its                    sophisticated computational modeling and related potential for                  contributing to artificial intelligence technology.  The language               learning research has significant potential for technological                   spin-off in machine learning and automatic acquisition of lexical               and grammatical information for language systems, crucial to the                development of grammars sufficient for the robust analysis of                   unconstrained text.  And the language processing research will                  have significant impact on the technological base for human-                    computer interaction, in particular the design of natural                       language interfaces for data base and expert systems and                        knowledge-rich systems in general.                                                                                                                              This Center will stimulate enhanced activity in precollege                      education and in the development of human resources.",
