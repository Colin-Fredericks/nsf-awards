 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project constitutes a part of the United State Joint                       Global Ocean Flux Study to be conducted in the Central                          Equatorial Pacific in 1992.  Metazoan zooplankton have been                     identifies as the most likely agents for particle                               transformation and subsequent export of organic matter to                       deeper ocean layers.  Thus, understanding the functioning and                   assessing the efficiency of the biological pump, that is the                    downward fluxes of carbon and nitrogen resulting from the                       balance of production and consumption of biological material by                 the pelagic community, requires knowledge of the rates at which                 zooplankton consume and transform suspended particles.  This                    project will examine in detail the role of metazoa zooplankton                  in the biological pump of the central equatorial Pacific Ocean.                 Sophisticated techniques will be used to assess the variability                 in the upper 200 m of mesozooplankton biomass, grazing rates                    and fecal matter production rates.  Size specific and community                 based rates of phytoplankton consumption will be compared with                  phytoplankton production and fecal matter production will be                    related to particulate organic carbon and nitrogen fluxes to                    establish what percentage of the photosynthetically fixed                       carbon is ingested and potentially exported to deeper zones.                    This project will provide critical information necessary to                     quantify the flow of carbon and nitrogen in the upper layers of                 the central equatorial Pacific.",
