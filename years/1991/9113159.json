 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our program supports Native American Students who declare                     themselves forestry majors at Northern Arizona University.                      Enrichment activities support  retention.  We will address                      family and community participation, cultural dissonance,                        and the cause of low student self-esteem.  Central to the                       effort will be a full-time Native American professional                         counselor/advisor.  The program will fund visits and                            communication between family members and School of Forestry                     faculty and students.  Native American professionals will                       become involved as role model/mentors and advisors.  Inclusion                  of Native American professionals will become involvement as                     role model/mentors and advisors.  Inclusion of Native American                  values, tradition, and knowledge in the undergraduate                           curriculum will be a priority.  The first year student                          research program will focus on the content of the junior year                   curriculum; a faculty member with primary responsibility for                    that curriculum will supervise the summer research work, which                  will be conducted by the Native Americans who have completed                    the junior year course work.  In future years, the research                     agenda will continue to relate to the curriculum, with                          additional effort motivated by problems defined in                              consultation with tribal forestry departments.  Our measures                    of success are increased in (1) graduation rates of Native                      Americans and (2) numbers of Native Americans pursuing                          advanced degrees in science.",
