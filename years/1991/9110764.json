 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the development of new theory                             and techniques dealing with the analysis and synthesis                          of control systems in the presence of uncertainty.  The                         main outcome of this project is a theory that provides a                        systematic means for designing controllers which lead                           to systems possessing optimal stability and performance                         properties despite the presence of plant and signal                             uncertainty.  This theory is based on the structured                            uncertainty model which allows the inclusion of                                 information about the sources of modelling uncertainty                          thus minimizing conservatism in the analysis and design                         procedures.  In addition, by adopting the l-infinity                            signal norm, time domain objectives can be included in                          the design in a natural way.  The use of this norm                              distinguishes this approach from other approaches and                           provides a novel way for addressing the issues involved                         in controlling uncertain systems.  The methods                                  employed in the project will take advantage of recently                         developed theory which makes possible the analysis of                           system stability and performance robustness.                                    Numerical algorithms implementing the developed                                 controller synthesis techniques will also be developed                          and applied to practical examples.  In addition, the                            theory for robustness analysis will be extended to                              incorporate a larger class of systems and to allow a                            better representation of disturbances and uncertainty.",
