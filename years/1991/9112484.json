 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant                                   will enable the purchase of a Neodymium-YAG                                     infrared laser, an infrared TV camera, and an                                   infrared scanning Fabry Perot optical spectrum                                  analyzer for novel electro-optical modulator research                           at Caltech.                                                                                                                                                     A serious difficulty in extending the operation of                              travelling-wave electro-optical modulators into the 100                         GHz (3mm) region is caused by dispersion in the                                 modulator material, crystalline lithium niobate.  The                           optical wave travels through the crystal much faster                            than the modulation wave; as a consequence, the                                 modulation process gets out of step at these high                               frequencies.  A technique being studied at Caltech                              breaks the modulation transmission line into a                                  number of short segments, and drives each segment                               from its own tiny dipole antenna integrated on the                              surface of the crystal.  The antennas are excited by a                          plane wave radiated from a waveguide, incident at                               just the correct angle to keep the modulating wave in                           step with the optical wave on the average.  As a                                bonus, using antennas and radiation rather than coax                            connectors and bond wires to couple the modulation                              to the transmission lines eliminates parasitic electrical                       elements that would be very detrimental in the mm-                              wave range.                                                                                                                                                     Modulation frequencies as high as 63 GHz (4.8 m)                                have been used with an 18 mm long lithium niobate                               modulator with good efficiency.  These initial                                  experiments employed red laser light at 633 nm.                                 Practical fiber optical systems that use such                                   modulators for information transmission (telephone,                             CATV, radar signals, etc.) all operate at 1320 or 1550                          nm, however.  This grant will allow the extension of                            this wave-coupled modulator research to those                                   wavelengths.",
