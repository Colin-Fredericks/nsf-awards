 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process by which candidates for the presidency are selected is              central to the relationship between the American people and their               leaders.  Yet, although the behavior of voters in the general                   election has been studied extensively, research concerning the                  behavior of candidates in the primaries is embryonic.  This                     research attempts to correct this neglect by developing and testing             a dynamic, process model of presidential nomination campaigns.                                                                                                  Specifically, a model is proposed of the relationship between                   candidates' resource decisions across the primary campaign, the                 results of the primaries, and the candidates' success.  The model               will be tested using data on candidate spending and election                    outcomes during the past six and the 1992 presidential primary                  campaigns.  Interviews with the candidates in 1992 will provide a               further test of the model's validity.                                                                                                                           When completed this ambitious research should greatly increase our              understanding of presidential campaigns.  The results should be of              significance in helping to evaluate reform proposals to alter                   presidential primaries by creating regional or national primaries               or by altering public financing.",
