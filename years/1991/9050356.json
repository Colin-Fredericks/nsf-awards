 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project targets elementary school teachers (grades              3-6) in the greater Boston area.  The project's intent is to                    enhance teachers' understanding of central and pervasive                        mathematics concepts, and the processes by which mathematics is                 learned.  The mathematics topics to be addressed are measurement,               number systems, number relation ships, estimation, patterns and                 functions, and geometry.  The project will emphasize the                        assessment of mathematical ideas, and the use of activity-based                 instruction.  Two cohorts of teachers will be involved in summer                work shops and sustained academic year activities.  Leadership                  training will be provided in the third summer, and the teacher                  leaders  will be involved in in-service work sponsored by the                   Massachusetts State Department of Education.  Cost sharing is                   provided by the Massachusetts State Department of Education, the                Education Collaborative for Greater Boston, and the participating               schools as 19% of the NSF award.",
