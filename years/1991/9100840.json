 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program for undergraduates at Florida International                University is designed to stimulate and promote interest,                       curiosity, creative and critical thinking of undergraduate students             in environmental science and engineering during their early years               in undergraduate program.  This work involves students in a                     comprehensive research program relative to movement of oil spills               and treatment of contaminated media to minimize potential damage                to the environment.  The program engages students with different                areas of research relative to movement and treatment of oil spills.             The areas of research are in the following areas: environmental                 biology, environmental physics, environmental chemistry,                        environmental modeling, and process design.                                     The research goals follow:  formulate a detailed mathematical model             to study the movement of oil spills and develop innovative                      treatment processes to minimize the potential impacts of the oil                spills in the environment;  conduct experiments to evaluate the                 significance of physical, chemical, and biological parameters in                containment and treatment of oil spills;  evaluate the relative                 significance of time and length scales for analyzing dynamics of                oil migration and study effectiveness of containment options and                treatment processes.",
