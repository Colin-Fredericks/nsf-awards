 "awd_abstract_narration": "Classical SIMD associative processors execute arithmetic in a bit-              serial word-parallel manner.  Current massively parallel machines               also perform bit-serial arithmetic in a fine grain computing                    environment.  This bit-serial property is a limiting factor in                  increasing processing speeds.  A simple but powerful new                        architecture based on the classical associative processor model is              proposed here.  By distributing logic among slices of storage cells             such that a number of bit-planes share a simple logic unit, bit-                parallel arithmetic in a massively parallel environment becomes                 feasible.  For m-bit operands, complex operations such as                       multiplications execute in O(m) cycle as opposed to O(m2) for bit-              serial machines.  The simplicity of the architecture enables its                implementation using VLSI technology, and hence allows the                      construction of a word-Parallel, bit-Parallel, massively Parallel               (P3) computing system.                                                          The main goal of the proposed work is to build an experimental P3               machine which is to be embedded into a heterogeneous supercomputing             environment.  The need for such architecture and for an actual                  working prototype stems from a number of applications which cannot              be solved in conventional spercomputers.  In this proposal, space               science applications are outlined as this work is also supported                by NASA.",
