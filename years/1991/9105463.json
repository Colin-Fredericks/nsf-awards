Preliminary work by Dr. Jochim indicates that the site was                      occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers approximately 6500 years                ago.  It lies on the shoreline of a former lake and is rich in                  both lithic and faunal remains.  During one season of fieldwork                 Dr. Jochim and his colleagues will excavate an area of 80-100                   square meters.  All finds will be measured in three dimensions                  and all sediments screened.  In addition, soil samples will be                  studied to recover small lithic debitage and faunal remains.                    Soil samples will be taken for palynological and botanical                      analysis and charcoal samples collected for radiocarbon dating.                 Botanical floral and lithic analysis will be conducted.                                                                                                         The period around 6500 years ago marks a time of marked change in               this region.  The local Mesolithic inhabitants, who for thousands               of years hunted and gathered, were exposed to intrusive \"Linear                 Band Ceramic\" (LBK) cultures which were intrusive to the region                 and which followed a Neolithic way of life.  The LBK peoples                    planted crops, kept domestic animals and used ceramic vessels.                  Because archaeologists are interested in questions of culture                   change and contact, the interaction between Mesolithic foragers                 and LBK immigrants is a subject of great interest.  Several                     models, ranging from avoidance to open warfare to cooperation                   have been proposed yet data is not available to select among                    them.  Because the HNW-2 contains rich well stratified remains                  from the appropriate time period, it has the potential to shed                  light on this issue.  The small scale work proposed for this one                season project should establish a basis for a larger project.                                                                                                   This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to a large number of Europeanist archaeologists.               It will, hopefully, provide new insight into how cultures                       interact and change Finally it will aid in the training of                      students.",
