 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. James Boone, Mr. Christopher Dore will               collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  He will work in the                Mayan village of Xculoc, located in the Puuc region of Campeche                 Mexico and will collect information which will allow him to link                behavior to the built environment.  The inhabitants of Xculoc                   follow a traditional subsistence way of life and the results of                 this work will be applicable to similar Mesoamerican villages,                  both past and present.  Mr. Dore will obtain aerial photographs                 and use them to construct a village map.  All structures will be                noted.  He will then list artifacts associated with each.  To                   complete this first part of his research, he will note the                      individuals who use each structure and collect demographic                      information about them.  This will include such variables as                    socioeconomic status.  The second stage of the research consists                of a behavioral analysis where a sampling technique will be                     employed to relate behavior to the built environment.  In this                  way it will be possible to determine how these two variables                    interact.                                                                                                                                                       In Middle America, as well as many other parts of the world,                    archaeologists often excavate prehistoric villages of roughly the               same scale as Xculoc.  Remains of houses and other architectural                features, as well as artifacts are often recovered and with these               data, an attempt is made to reconstruct inhabitants' behavior.                  Assumptions are often made: for example, it is usually stated                   that higher status people have larger dwellings.  However, no one               has ever examined such issues in a controlled circumstance where                both behavior and structures can be directly observed.  Mr.                     Dore's research will begin to fill this gap.                                                                                                                    The work is important for several reasons.  Xculoc is located in                a region with many large prehistoric sites and the data Mr. Dore                collects is directly relevant to their interpretation.  On a                    broader scale, the general methodological tools which he forges                 will be useful in many archaeological situations where no direct                historic link exists.  Finally, this project will assist in the                 training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
