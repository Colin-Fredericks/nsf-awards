This process, in turn, will aid the Program                   in long-range planning.                                                                                                                                         The specific goals of the workshops include:                                                                                                                    1) Providing an environment for the dynamic exchange of ideas                   in organic synthesis and natural products chemistry among a                     small group (about 20) of active young researchers in these                     fields.                                                                                                                                                         2) Encouraging an attitude of cooperation among individuals                     working in related areas, and thereby, avoiding duplicative                     efforts.                                                                                                                                                        3) Stimulating participants to study new problems and methods                   in synthetic and natural products chemistry.                                                                                                                    4) Creating an atmosphere in which the scientific and social                    interaction among participants will be both stimulating and                     pleasant.",
