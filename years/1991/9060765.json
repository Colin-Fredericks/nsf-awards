 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an increasing need for improvements in the                        fabrication of small diameter orifices in hardened metal                        components.  This need is particularly acute in the fabrication of              fuel injectors for gasoline and diesel engines.  In those engines,              the injectors are used to both meter and atomize the fuel.  For a               given pressure drop, the flow through the injector orifices varies              inversely with the fourth power of the orifice diameter.                        Therefore, small variations in hole diameter result in large                    variations in flow.  Existing microdrilling techniques (EDM, laser              and electron beam drilling, and others) have marginal accuracy and              produce a rough recast layer which results in burrs at the inlet                an exit of the orifices.  Poor injector hole quality leads to                   variations in fuel-to-air ratio resulting in poor engine                        performance and increased pollution.                                                 This research addresses an improved microdrilling process.                 The process is a derivative of electrochemical machining (ECM) and              has the potential to produce burr-free holes with tight dimensional             control and low cycle times.  This technique would reduce costs and             improve the productivity and quality of the injector manufacturing              process.",
