 "awd_abstract_narration": "A transcript at the flightless gene locus of Drosophila                         melanogaster exhibits significant homology with the cytoskeleton                regulating protein factor gelsolin from vertebrates. When                       mutagenized, the gene causes either severe disruptions of the                   flight muscle structure or embryonic death. Gelsolin is                         implicated in a plethora of morphogenetic processes by either                   promoting the formation of actin filaments from monomeric                       subunits, or by restricting their length in a calcium dependent                 fashion. The molecular analysis of the Drosophila homologue of                  this family of actin-severing proteins will, for the first time,                provide a way to correlate the molecular structure of a                         cytoskeleton-regulating factor with the cellular effects of a                   specific mutation. The project proposes to determine                            transcriptional patterns of the flightless gene by DNA sequence                 analysis and to study the developmental and tissue-specific                     expression by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry.                    Furthermore, it is intended to analyze mutant alleles by the                    polymerase chain reaction to obtain information about functional                sites within the molecule, and to study the effects of over                     expression in situ by germ line transformation with a construct                 containing the gelsolin gene under the control of heterologous                  promoter. The results from this study are expected to provide a                 detailed understanding of functional domains of gelsolin its                    evolution, and of its role during embryonic development and                     myogenesis.",
