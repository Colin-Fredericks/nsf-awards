 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aim: Reinforce learning between analytical, empirical and case                  study methods of architectural study.  Comparison of analytical                 results (algorithm and/or computer simulation) to physical                      testing of scale models and field measurements of existing                      building.                                                                                                                                                       Major Instruments: Microcomputer with data acquisition interface,               data logging capability and interface to basic and spreadsheet                  software.  Computer output to VGA and composite video for VHS                   video tape documentation.  Computer will read and record                        environmental data from sensors attached to scale architectural                 models under controlled conditions.  Remote data monitoring                     equipment will be used for case study measurements.  Software for               computer simulation, data translation and analysis as well as                   instrument control also employed.                                                                                                                               Application: Scale architectural models are suitable for                        schematic design level study of daylighting, solar access, cross                ventilation, acoustical and other technical areas influenced by                 the architect's design decisions.",
