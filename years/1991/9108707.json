 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Voigtman will perform detailed, fully quantitative                    studies of five important spectrometric techniques (optical                     polarimetry, circular dichroism, thermal lensing, photothermal                  refraction, and thermal lensing/circular dichroism) with the                    goal of synthesizing complete pictures of how these techniques                  can be refined and optimized in their design and performance as                 ultra-sensitive spectrometric techniques.  Detailed computer                    simulations, using a custom-programmed set of optical and                       electronic signal processing blocks, will be used to mimic and                  predict the performance of the techniques under a variety of                    experimental conditions.  The program libraries, used with a                    commercially available simulation program engine, will afford a                 seamless integration of optics and electronics on a single                      computer screen worksheet.  The research will make it possible                  to design a new spectrometric technique from scratch as                         experience with the libraries of component blocks grows and as                  the behavior of the blocks is refined.                                          %%%                                                                             With this award the Chemistry Division will support Dr. Edward                  G. Voigtman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of                 Massachusetts,Amherst, for a project in course and curriculum                   development.  The project will attempt to gain a complete                       picture as to how five spectroscopic techniques may be refined                  and optimized.  The resulting optimized techniques will be of                   great use to researchers in both academia and industry and will                 provide a powerful teaching aid for graduate students in the                    construction of optical systems.",
