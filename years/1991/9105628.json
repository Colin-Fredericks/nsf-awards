 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographic factors strongly influence the atmospheric processes            that lead to heavy rains.  This doctoral dissertation project will              provide an analysis of the subsynoptic character of heavy rain for a            broad area encompassing the flood-prone Appalachian mountains of the            United States.  The horizontal movement of masses of air that causes            changes in the physical properties of air will be calculated for a              large, spatially unbiased sample of heavy rain events.  A principal             components analysis will be performed to identify modes of covariance in        the advection fields associated by these air movements.  This analysis          will be followed by a cluster analysis to objectively determine groups          of heavy rain events with common low-level moisture, thermal and mid-           level vorticity advection patterns.  After examining geographic patterns        in the occurrence of heavy rain groups, subsynoptic scenarios of heavy          rain for the Appalachian region will be developed.                                                                                                                   This project will provide a better understanding of the role of            advection processes in heavy rain development.  Patterns of geographic          variations expected in the relationship of the advection fields will            permit inferences to be made about the ways that mountain orientation           and the location of moisture sources alters the subsynoptic regimes             associated with heavy rainfall.  The development of heavy rain scenarios        for the flood-prone Appalachian region will provide forecasters with            much needed guidance in the prediction of heavy rain.  This project also        will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to          continue to develop independent research skills.",
