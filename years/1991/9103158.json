 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physiological and biochemical adaptations of animals to                environmental stresses will be studied.  The major project                      concerns the tolerance of freshwater turtles to anoxia and                      acidosis similar to what they experience during their winter                    hibernation period.  In addition, the respiratory and metabolic                 responses of bats during daily torpor, a normal occurrence in                   these animals, has recently been studied.                                            Earlier work on whole animal responses, particularly                       metabolic and blood acid-base responses, found that long-term                   survival without oxygen is possible mainly due to a drastic                     reduction in energy metabolism, and to a lesser extent to                       effective buffering of accumulated acids by release of calcium                  carbonate from the shell.  Recent research has been directed to                 the turtle heart in vitro, using perfused hearts either in a                    conventional tissue bath or in an NMR spectrometer.  These                      studies have revealed that the isolated heart can maintain near                 normal levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and mechanical                    function for many hours of anoxia, but when anoxia and acidosis                 are combined, the heart fails mechanically.  One current                        objective is to learn whether this is really 'failure' or whether               instead it is an adaptive arrest of function that enables                       survival under these conditions.  Other current objectives                      involve defining cellular mechanisms of acid-base control, ion                  balance, and metabolic regulation that underlie the extraordinary               behavior of these animals.",
