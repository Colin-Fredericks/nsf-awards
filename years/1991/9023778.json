 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program will focus on investigating the catalytic                  phenomena involved in hydrodenitrogenation reactions over sulfided              and unsulfided Ni-Mo catalysts.  The catalysts to be used in this               study will be synthesized by three different techniques, namely,                homogeneous sulfide precipitation, impregnated thiosalt                         decomposition and intercalation of nickel and molybdenum cations                in clay matrices.  Catalyst characterization will be performed                  using various techniques including BET surface area and pore size               distribution analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission             electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, laser Raman              Spectroscopy and Raman microprobe and X-ray photoelectron                       spectroscopy.  Thermal analysis techniques will also be used                    through temperature-programmed reduction, desorption and                        sulfidation studies.  In addition to ambient characterization of                the catalysts, in-situ characterization techniques will also be                 adopted using a laser Raman spectrometer and a specially designed               in-situ Raman cell.  The changes that take place in the catalyst                during oxidation, reduction, sulfidation, reaction and deactivation             processes will be examined in-situ.  These studies will be used to              investigate the nature of the active form of the catalyst and the               catalyst support interactions.  In addition to examining the                    reaction network, the effect of reaction parameters such as                     hydrogen partial pressure, reaction temperature and pressure and                the effect of substituents will also be investigated.  Finally,                 isotopic labelling techniques will be combined with kinetic studies             and in-situ laser Raman spectroscopy studies to gain insight into               the catalytic phenomena involved in hydrodenitrogenation reactions.",
