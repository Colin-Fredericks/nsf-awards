 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in algebra and                   number theory between Dr. Henri Gillet, University of                           Illinois at Chicago, and Dr. Christian Soule, Director of                       Research at the French National Center for Scientific                           Research and presently at the Institut des Hautes Etudes                        Scientifiques, Bures-sur-Yvette, France.                                                                                                                        Drs. Gillet and Soule propose to investigate the relationship                   between analytic and algebraic constructions which occur in                     arithmetic geometry.  In particular they will pursue the                        applications of their previous work on arithmetic intersection                  theory and the arithmetic Riemann-Roch theorem to problems in                   geometry and number theory.  Specific areas to be studied                       include the inequalities in Arakelov geometry, the Adelic                       Arakelov theory.  Dr. Gillet is one of the leading experts on                   the relationships between K-theory and algebraic geometry, as                   well as on the Arakelov theory.  This award will allow him to                   continue a highly fruitful collaboration with an outstanding                    French mathematician with complementary expertise.",
