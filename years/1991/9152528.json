 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the existing Robotics and Intelligent                     Systems Laboratory (RISL), currently consisting of a PUMA 562                   manipulator, two RTX educational robots and extensive VME-based                 hardware.  The lab is used for class demonstrations,                            programming assignments, term projects, and research in                         undergraduate courses which cover robotics, artificial                          intelligence, computer control, neural computing and computer                   architectures.  Improvement of the RISL is provided by a robot                  vision system with the following major components:  frame                       grabber (DIGIMAX and FRAMESTORE boards), video convolution                      module (VFIR board), feature extraction and histogramming                       module (FEATUREMAX board) and supporting video software library                 (IMAGEFLOW).  All these components are a set of Datacube's                      compatible boards which are be plugged into existing MPC-200                    workstation.  New equipment consisting of a standard CCD                        cameras with lenses, stands and monochrome monitor is being                     used in a sequence of pilot projects which starts with 2D                       recognition and locating simple known objects, and continues                    with 3D vision.  These projects provide basic tools for further                 undergraduate research in robotics (path planning, object                       handling, simple assembly tasks, etc.) and artificial                           intelligence (image understanding, representation and planning                  in blocks world).  This project expands the application areas                   of existing robots, especially in the area of artificial                        intelligence, and makes undergraduate courses in robotics and                   AI more modern and  attractive to students seeking practical                    experience with high-tech instruments, such as robots and                       machine vision systems.",
