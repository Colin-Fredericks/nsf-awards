 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little is understood of how environmental and social                            factors, particularly territorial aggression, affect the                        breeding of migratory arctic birds.  Relationships between                      reproduction and environmental induced stress, where they play an               important adaptive role, are virtually unknown in high latitude                 species.  Many species arrive in the arctic,establish territories               and eventually feed their nestlings in a fraction of the time for               temperate birds.  Adherence to this rigorous schedule, pairs must               ignore environmental conditions that would normally inhibit or                  delay breeding at temperate latitudes.  Dr. Wingfield proposes that             these constraints have been met by adaptations of the endocrine                 system in arctic birds.  This study proposes to continue                        examining the relationship between two potentially                              antagonistic hormones: corticosterone, which directs                            behavior away from reproductive activities and towards                          survival activities and testosterone, which mediates the                        aggressive behavior associated with territoriality.  In both                    hormone-behavior systems, Dr. Wingfield suggests that the                       endocrine responses of arctic-nesting birds will show                           decrease sensitivity to environmental stimuli, allowing more                    prolonged opportunities to breed.  The endocrine adaptations                    to be investigated in this research program may elucidate                       physiological mechanisms by which polar animals avoid delays                    and/or conflicting behaviors which might reduce their                           chances for successful reproduction.",
