 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 State University of New York College at Buffalo for the repair                  and renovation of the Great Lakes Field Station which houses that               institution's biological, chemical, and technological research                  and research training activities that comprise aquatic science.                 This building was constructed in 1952 and last renovated in 1981.               The ARFMP grant of $350,000 and $350,000 provided by the grantee                as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                    research training facilities, thus allowing a significant                       increase in the number of faculty and students that can be                      accommodated in Great Lakes.focused research efforts as well as                 in the number of academic and industrial investigations which                   concern the effect of effluents on the lakes system that can be                 conducted.  The project will address the need to improve the                    current research infrastructure by upgrading the system capable                 of supplying untreated Lake Erie water, repairing lake access                   structures, replacing deteriorated lake/river specimen and fish                 holding tanks and raceways, providing larger and more modern wet                laboratory facilities, repairing external holding ponds, and                    enhancing chemical safety and personal security systems.                                                                                                        This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                   graduate students.  The program focus on the zebra mussel                       invasion means that the students trained in these laboratories                  will not only have expertise in basic research, but they will                   also be prepared to address a very important regional problem of                applied research.",
