 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because different astrophysical processes show characteristic                   emission at different wavelengths, astronomers seek many different              wavelength windows to the universe.  The difficulty of making                   infrared observations from typical optical observatories led NASA               to construct a 3-meter dedicated telescope on the summit of Mauna               Kea, Hawaii in the mid-1970's.  NASA decided, however, that half                the total observing time would satisfy its needs, and allocated the             other half to visitors.                                                                                                                                         The National Science Foundation has provided funds to support these             visitors since the opening of the telescope in 1979.  While the                 NASA observers examine objects related in some way to NASA space                missions, the visitors are free to observe any object of sufficient             scientific interest, whether in or out of our Galaxy.  The modest               amount of money is used for accommodations, local transportation,               cryogen (to cool the telescopes), and publication in the scientific             journals.  The success and diversity of the program fully justify               its continued funding.",
