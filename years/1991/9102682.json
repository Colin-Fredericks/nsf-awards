 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will develop numerical simulation-based  shrinkage                prediction criteria for the optimization of casting design of                   commercial ductile and gray iron castings.  The initial focus                   will be on ductile iron.  Shrinkage prediction for this                         important commercial alloy is complicated not only by the                       complexity of solidification behavior, but also by its extreme                  sensitivity to metallurgical processing conditions.  Thus, an                   essential requirement for the development of practically useful                 design software is the development of a kinetic model of cast                   iron solidification which realistically accounts for the effects                of metallurgical processing on mode and sequence of the                         solidification.  A combined micro-modeling/thermal analysis                     approach to solificaction modeling will be developed,                           along with an algorithm for applying the solidifaction model to                 the estimation  of volume changes during freezing on the basis of               conservation of energy and mass, and thermodynamic                              considerations.  The ultimate goal of the research is the                       development of an integrated computer-based methodology for                     process control, optimization of  casting design, and diagnosis                 of casting defects which takes into account the interdependent                  effects of metallurgical variables, molding factors, and geometry               on casting quality.                                                                  Castings are designed in industry by a process that involves               much trial and error, since experience is the only available                    tool.  This project involves the development of a design tool                   which incorporates current understanding of the metallurgy of the               cast metal and additional insights that result from the research                project.  Therefore, parts can be designed more precisely,                      reducing the number of failed attempts.",
