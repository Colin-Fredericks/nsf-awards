 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in             nuclear physics and astrophysics between Krunoslav Subotic of the               Boris Kidrich Institute and Walter Benenson of Michigan State                   University National Cyclotron Laboratory is to study and produce new            nuclei, which have never been observed in nature.  Dr. Subotic will             participate in high beam experiments at MSU over a three year                   period.  Data analysis will take place at both MSU and the Boris                Kidrich Institute.  Measurements and identification of new nuclei               will further understanding of supernovae and the formation of the               early universe.  It is expected that this project will lead to a                long-term relationship with the Boris Kidrich Institute.  Their                 cyclotron facility is nearing completion and is expected to be                  operational in the near future.                                                                                                                                 This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The award,                except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav             institution.",
