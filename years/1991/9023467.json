 "awd_abstract_narration": "CuInSe2 has been targeted as the major photovoltaic                             material, but the efforts at utilizing its optimum                              properties have not been extended to n-CuInSe2 due                              to lack of an appropriate p-type window material.  In                           Phase I, we established the feasibility of fabricating                          a new n-CuInSe2-based thin film solar cell by using a                           novel concept of electrochemical surface conversion                             to p-(CuIn2Se3I)-CuISe3 to form of a n/p                                        heterojunction.  The cell performance was primarily                             determined by the quality of the n-CuInSe2 films and                            to a lesser extent by the window layer growth                                   parameters.  The window layer composition and                                   morphology can be controlled with electrolyte                                   composition.  The Phase II effort is aimed at in-                               depth investigation of the properties n-CuInSe2 and                             the window layer, the surface conversion mechanism                              and the opto-electronic properties of the n/p                                   junction.  These studies are essential for the                                  development and optimization of the cell components,                            processing and operation.  In addition to processing,                           cost and environmental advantages, inherent in this                             simple electrochemical approach to heterojunction                               formation, several other benefits are anticipated for                           the title cell over the present p-CuInSe2/n-CdS cell.                           Optimum lattice match between CuInSe2 and                                       CuIn2Se3I transition layer, low interface state density,                        higher electron mobility in n-type absorber, improved                           adhesion to ITO/Glass substrate, greater stability due                          to similar components (except I) on both sides of the                           junction should lead to a more efficient and stable                             solar cell.",
