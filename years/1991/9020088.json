 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although branchipods are often depicted as primitive crustaceans,               little is known about the morphology and relationships of the                   constituent groups.  The branchipod taxon Conchostraca, recently                split into two orders, is a diverse assemblage of small, bivalved,              freshwater crustaceans.  The first of the two conchostracan orders              (Laevicaudata) was addressed earlier; the Spinicaudata are the                  focus of this proposal.  The goals of the research have been                    expanded to encompass the entire Branchiopoda, with emphasis on the             spinicaudatan families.  The proposed research is a three phase                 project consisting of 1) a thorough morphological treatment of each             genus of the four spinicaudatan clam shrimp families                            (Cyclestheriidae, Cyzicidae, Leptestheriidae, and Limnadiidae); 2)              a phylogenetic analysis of the morphological data and employing                 outgroups in the Cladocera, Anostraca, and Notostraca; and 3) a                 phylogenetic analysis employing 18S ribosomal RNA sequences from                fresh material of all 8 currently recognized branchipod orders.                 Of the five families previously combined in the taxon Conchostraca,             morphological examinations and systematic reviews have been                     completed of two:  Lynceidae and Limnadiidae.  A third family (the              monotypic Cyclestheriidae) has been carefully examined and found                to be invariant and to agree with morphological descriptions made               in the last century.  Thus, three of the five conchostracan                     families are completed.  This project is to complete the                        morphological examination and data collection for the two remaining             spinicaudatan families ( Cyzicidae and Leptestheriidae) and for                 the outgroups in the Cladocera, Anostraca, and Notostraca, and to               collect fresh material for the rRNA work.",
