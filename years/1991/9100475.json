The program is                      designed to build upon and make more effective a formal                         curriculum known as the Research Apprenticeship Program.  The                   training model features apprenticeship, hands-on teaching, where                students learn by actively participating in all phases of a                     research study-- from problem formulation to data collection and                analysis to presentation at a professional meeting, manuscript                  preparation and publication.  Students may work with one of 16                  Faculty Associates, whose interests collectively address                        biological, physiological and sociocultural aspects of behavior                 and represent the full spectrum of university-level scholarship                 in psychology, from neuroanatomy to literary analysis, from work                with animals to studies of peoples in foreign cultures.  Specific               features of the proposed project include (1) funding summer                     research, (2) scheduling University Conferences and Summer                      Seminars to promote collegial scientific discourse with and among               students, (3) funding student paper presentations at professional               meetings and (4) extending opportunities for research experiences               to students outside the Clark community, particularly to women,                 blacks, and Hispanics.  These features support the principal goal               of the REU program, to promote careers in scientific research.",
