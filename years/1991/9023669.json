 "awd_abstract_narration": "The significance of the proposed research is that it is the first               chance sea ice ecologists have of obtaining time series data on                 microbial biomass accumulation, growth rates and productivity in                the Antarctic pack ice ecosystem.  This information is essential                to understanding overall Southern Ocean productivity.  Pack ice                 covers 20 million square kilometers of the surface of the                       Southern Ocean.  Because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the                AnZone project, Dr. Sullivan proposes to investigate primary                    production and factors that influence the growth and development                of microalgal and bacterial assemblages with the first and second               year pack ice.  AnZone project is an international cooperative                  program located in western Weddell Sea.  The research planned                   under the AnZone project will contribute substantially to                       understanding biological rate processes in sea ice.                             Additionally, Dr. Sullivan proposes to examine indicators of                    natural cell metabolism as indices of natural growth of pack ice                microalgae.  Throughout these investigations, Dr. Sullivan will                 test the hypothesis that a substantial fraction of primary and                  secondary productivity within the ice covered region of the                     Southern Ocean occurs within the pack ice and that it is mediated               by microalgae and bacteria associated with the extensive ice                    crystal surfaces of the pack ice habitat.",
