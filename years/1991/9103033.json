 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor McDuff has recently concentrated her attention on                4-dimensional manifolds, using and developing techniques first                  introduced by Gromov.  She has shown that a large class of                      minimal symplectic 4-manifolds (those containing \"nice\"                         symplectically embedded 2-spheres) carry a unique symplectic                    structure in each cohomology class.  She intends to continue                    this work: for example, to see if she can extend the above result               to manifolds which contain a symplectically embedded surface of                 higher genus, or to see if she can find a 4-manifold which                      supports different symplectic and Kahler structures in the same                 cohomology class.  The class of symplectic 4-manifolds lies                     between the class of Kahler surfaces and the class of smooth 4-                 manifolds, and, if it turns out that symplectic 4-manifolds                     behave nicely enough, one might be able to use information on                   their structure to obtain information on the class of 4-manifolds               itself.                                                                              Professor Jones will continue his joint research with F. T.                Farrell.  One of their most recent results states that the                      surgery L-groups and the rational algebraic K-groups for the                    group ring ZG can be computed in a simple way from the L-groups                 and rational K-groups of group rings ZG', where G' is any                       virtually cyclic subgroup G' in G provided G is a co-compact                    discrete subgroup of a virtually connected Lie group.  In the                   next three years they hope to prove this same result for more                   general groups G.                                                                    Symplectic manifolds arise in the study of mechanics, both                 classical and quantum.  Lie groups are also ubiquitous in                       mechanics.  It would seem that mathematics and theoretical                      physics are not entirely distinct subjects at this level.",
