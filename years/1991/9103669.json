 "awd_abstract_narration": "This contract with Air New Zealand has been negotiated to provide               Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM) on the National Science                 Foundation's LC-130 aircraft.  The aircraft undergo a yearly                    overhaul, and the ability to have this maintenance performed in                 Christchurch, New Zealand, will enhance the capability of VXE- 6                to accomplish its mission in the Antarctic Program.  Since the                  majority of the yearly flying is done in and around Christchurch                and Antarctica, having maintenance capability close to the source               of heavy flight operations will allow more flexibility in the                   scheduling of yearly maintenance.                                                                                                                               This contract provides aircraft maintenance support to the program              and will be administered, including distributions of funds, by the              U.S. Navy - Naval Air Pacific Repair Activity in Atsugi, Japan.                                                                                                 The anticipated Air New Zealand labor costs for the term of the                 contract are as follows:                                                                                                                                                  FY 1991        $1,153,000                                                       FY 1992        $  769,000                                                       FY 1993        $1,665,000                                                                                                                             The program manager recommends awarding of this action.",
