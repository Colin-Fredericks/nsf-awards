Phase one special education                      personnel in private and public schools and others who have                     direct interaction with the disabled to explain the goals of                    the program and enlist their aid in achieving these goals.                      %%%                                                                             In similar fashion, engineering firms and profesesional                         organizations are being approached to make a commitment to the                  education and employment of the disabled.                                       %%%                                                                             The work of the second phase involves exploring for ways to                     make engineering education possible and attractive to the                       disabled.  Recruited tools are being divised, from interactive                  computer programs to incentive booklets.  An outreach seminar                   is being planned whose main purpose will be to make an                          engineering career for the handicapped a reality in the minds                   of the disabled and those who work with the disabled.                           %%%                                                                             A third phase is planned and would see the model program                        expanded to a nationwide forum.  The lessons learned and                        knowledge gained in the current project will be transferred                     to concerned persons thought regional centers at strategic                      locations in the United States.",
