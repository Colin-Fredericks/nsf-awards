 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Beloit College for the renovation and repair of the Chamberlin                  Science Building which houses that institution's biology research               and research training activities.  This building was constructed                in 1967 and has not had any major renovations since then.  The                  ARFMP grant of $146,000 and $170,020 provided by the grantee as                 cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                       research training facilities.  This project will address the need               to improve the current research infrastructure by facilitating                  the conduct of a greater diversity of projects.  The renovation                 can be expected to reduce contamination that currently                          challenges some research efforts and to allow investigations to                 proceed with more exacting controls.                                                                                                                            This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               research training of quality undergraduate students.  In this                   biology program, individual research is dominant and students,                  alone or together with faculty, are trained primarily through                   their own independent investigations.",
