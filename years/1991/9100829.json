 "awd_abstract_narration": "An eight-week project of Research Experiences for Undergraduates                                                                                                will be supported by this award.  Six undergraduates will work on                                                                                               problems in probability theory.  The topics are distinct but                    interrelated having a strong theoretical component with                         significant applications.  The project will run for eight weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                A mainframe computer will be available for large scale                          computations as well as several microcomputers for local access                 and word processing.  Symbol-manipulative programs such a MAPLE                 and MACSYMA will be available for testing conjectures.                                                                                                          Each student project will derive from two basic areas of inquiry.                                                                                               First, the exact distribution theory of runs and patterns and                   second, the celebrated Chen-Stein method of Poisson and Gaussian                                                                                                approximation.  Applications of results to statistics or                        cryptography will be encouraged.  It is expected that students                  will be given two general problem areas.  They will follow the                  more promising through the project.                                                                                                                             One criterion for student selection will be their willingness and                                                                                               desire to spend a substantial amount of time after the formal                   completion of the project in writing up results obtained and to                 present them at professional meetings in which student research                 papers are on the agenda.",
