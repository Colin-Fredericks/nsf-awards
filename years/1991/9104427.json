 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards supports the research of Professors C. Delzell                 and J. Madden to work in real algebraic geometry.  They will work               on a general theory of local real algebraic geometry connecting                 singularities with intersections using notions from ordered                     fields.  They also intend to work on relations between lattice                  ordered rings and real algebraic geometry, Lipschitz continuity                 and differentiability of abstract semialgebraic functions and                   smoothly varying solutions to Hilbert's 17'th problem.                               The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                 the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                 to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems                that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures                  defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                       polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                       algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                 is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover, it has proved                   itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                      computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.",
