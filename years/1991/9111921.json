 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to address two key issues                    in the modeling of premixed turbulent reacting flows:  (1)                      examine the effects of flames on turbulence, principally                        through the pressure-velocity gradient correlation, which will                  address a major weakness in current turbulence models of                        reacting flows; and (2)  study effects of differential                          diffusion of mass and energy on combustion, which will address                  a significant aspect of combustion modeling that is not                         considered in present flamelet models.  To meet these                           objectives, turbulent flame propagation will be studied using                   direct numerical simulations.  These are large computer                         calculations in which no models are used.  Thus, they can be                    used like laboratory experiments to study basic physical                        processes in turbulent flames.  The approach proposed is to                     use DNS to examine the issues listed above and increase our                     understanding of the fundamental mechanisms and processes                       involved.  This insight is then used to suggest improvements                    to existing models and develop new models.  The models are                      tested using the data generated in the simulations.                                                                                                             Combustion is a significant and widespread source of power in                   many important technological systems.  Requirements for                         increased efficiency and reduced emissions are placing                          increased demands on these systems.  To effectively meet these                  requirements will require accurate predictive computer                          modeling.  These models must represent the complex processes                    of gas flow turbulence, combustion, and the interaction of the                  two.  Current models in these areas are lacking in many                         respects and are limiting the widespread use of computer                        modeling as an engineering design tool.",
