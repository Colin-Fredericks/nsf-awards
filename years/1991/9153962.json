 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Exploratorium proposes to create a multidimensional                         exhibition on the theme of navigation.  The exhibition                          proper will contain approximately 20 new interactive                            exhibits dealing with topics of human orientation,                              wayfinding/exploration, the importance of time in                               navigation, maps and navigation traditions.  Alongside the                      exhibits we will display real navigational artifacts                            borrowed from other museums.  We have identified                                approximately 40 existing exhibits which, while not in the                      main show, will receive textual modification to show their                      relation to navigational topics.  In addition to the                            exhibition of artifacts and interactive exhibits, we will                       present a series of lectures, theme weekends, and                               demonstrations of navigational techniques.  During the run                      of the show we will host a Symposium On The American                            Encounter wherein we will hold an open forum of lectures and                    discussion of historical, anthropological and social                            consequences of cultural encounter on the North American                        Continent.  We will produce both a brochure and a high                          quality catalog for this show.  In addition we will create                      written \"pathways\" of organization of this museum-wide show                     to bring to focus different features and approaches to                          navigation.  Our education departments will play a leading                      role in creating more formal programs for our visitors.  The                    physical show will be reproduced in a travelling version to                     tour nine venues in the three years following its opening at                    the Exploratorium.  We will collect the results of our                          researchers in a dissemination package to be made available                     to others in the field.",
