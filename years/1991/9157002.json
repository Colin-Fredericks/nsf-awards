 "awd_abstract_narration": "Self-reproduction is a central feature of living systems but is                 almost unprecedented in simple chemical systems.  A promising                   system to be studied to initiate the development of such                        capacity in a chemical system is the reaction of an achiral                     alpha-heteroaldehyde with a dialkylzinc reagent.  Dialkylzinc                   addition to aldehydes is normally a very slow reaction but can                  be catalyzed by the zinc alkoxides produced in the reaction and                 thus these systems show autocatalytic behavior.  Recent studies                 showed that the ethylzinc salt of (R)-1-phenylpropanol (70%ee)                  catalyzes the addition of diethylzinc to benzaldehyde,                          producing (R)-1-phenylpropanol (17%ee).  In this system the                     chiral catalyst generates its own enantiomer from achiral                       starting materials as it must to reproduce itself, but the                      reaction's low enantioselectivity leads to mainly a racemic                     mixture; much better enantioselective catalysts have been                       developed for the addition of diethylzinc to benzaldehyde.                      They all incorporate a second coordination site in the                          alkoxide, usually a nitrogen. The goal of this work is to                       design a system where an achiral aldehyde substrate leads to a                  chiral alkoxide which is an efficient, enantioselective                         catalyst for its own formation.  One of the most remarkable                     features of the aminoalcohol catalyst systems is that they show                 a positive nonlinear effect. The monomeric alkoxides are the                    active catalysts, but they will dimerize in solution to give                    inactive dimers.  The racemic dimer which is the most stable,                   is in effect removed from the catalytic system, thus increasing                 the enantioselectivity.  Monomeric and dimeric structures of                    the catalysts will be designed and modeled to produce a                         positive nonlinear effect by this mechanism.  A successful                      reaction system will produce a chiral alkoxide with increasing                  enantiomeric excess as the reaction proceeds.                                                                                                                   Dr. Scott Rychnovsky is being given the Presidential Young                      Investigator Award from the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program                 to support his research to develop chiral, self-replicating                     molecules.  This work has the potential to revolutionize how                    the complex chiral molecules will be synthesized in the future                  and completely change the nature of the strategic plans that                    are developed by the chemist in attacking new structures.",
