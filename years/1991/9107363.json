 "awd_abstract_narration": "Differences in behavior and morphology of males and females                are ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom, and commonly                      include dissimilarities in size, strength, coloration, and                      signaling behavior.  Such differences are usually attributed to                 the operation of sexual selection, which favors traits called                   secondary sexual characters that enhance the ability of their                   bearers to acquire mates.  Because of their greater intrinsic                   capacity for producing offspring, males are usually the focus of                more intense sexual selection than are females; as such,                        secondary sexual characters are most commonly expressed in males.               Traditionally, sexual selection has been assumed to act to                      increase the ability of males to compete for females (male-male                 competition) and/or to render males intrinsically more attractive               to females (female mate choice).                                                     Recent empirical work suggest that sexual selection need not               cease once females have mated.  In various insect species,                      females mated to more than one male may actively select the                     paternity of their offspring by 1) shunting sperm to specialized                compartments of elaborate sperm-storage structures, 2)                          interfering with the process of insemination, or 3) expelling                   unwanted sperm.  The proposed research will employ genetic                      analyses of crickets to examine the consequences of this poorly                 understood, though potentially powerful mechanism of evolutionary               change.  Understanding how postcopulatory female behavior                       contributes to male fertilization success will be of direct                     practical importance to the efficacy of integrated pest                         management strategies.  An important component of such programs                 involves the mass  release of sterilized male for the                           suppression of pest populations.",
