 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"IDEAS\" is a three year program targeted at increasing                          retention of women engineering students during the Freshman to                  Junior years at the Milwaukee School of Engineering.  It is                     part of a vigorous effort to significantly increase the                         percentage of graduating women engineers by the year 2000.                      The five phases - Innovation, Discovery, Experience,                            Assimilation and Stretching cover the Prefreshman through                       Sophomore years.  Bonding, technological literacy, strong                       faculty/staff support, professional/work contacts and positive                  role models are being emphasized during this period of study                    for the students.  All women engineering students will                          participate in IDEAS, not only as students, but also as                         mentors.  IDEAS is being developed and managed by women faculty                 and staff of the institution.",
