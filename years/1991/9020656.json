 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer hardware and software will be acquired to run the                 Scientific Data Management (SDM) system for meteorological data                 access and analysis developed by the UNIDATA Project Center.  The               SDM system is an essential element in achieving the major                       objective of this project - the incorporation of the                            methodologies of computerized data analysis into the meteorology                curriculum at Kean College.  Today's meteorology students need                  experience with these methodologies, and they require the means                 for efficient access to current data as well as new types of                    information to be available in the near future (i.e. NEXTRAD,                   profilers, and improved satellite capabilities).  These                         curriculum revisions are necessary to adapt our undergraduate                   program to the evolving technological developments in the field                 of meteorology.                                                                                                                                                      The curriculum revisions will include new approaches to                    teaching using computerized data analysis and the development of                a range of case studies and student exercises to reinforce the                  new methodologies.  Coexisting with the revision of the                         meteorology curriculum will be evaluation and assessment of its                 impact on student learning.  Evaluation of the curriculum                       objectives will be accomplished through a variety of standard                   means, as well as through specially designed assessment                         instruments as part of the existing program assessment effort at                Kean College.                                                                                                                                                        In addition to the curriculum objectives, the SDM system                   will provide improved access to data for faculty research in                    neural network approaches to local forecasting and mesoscale                    modeling, as well as for student research projects.  It will also               enhance our ability to share data with local high schools and                   other colleges in the area.",
