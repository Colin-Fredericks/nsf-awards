 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a general scheme for                 extending logic programming languages to include constraints.                   However, CLP languages, as well as most other constraint-based                  languages and systems, only allow the programmer to specify                     constraints that must hold.  In many applications, such as interactive          graphics, page layout, and decision support, one needs to express               preferences as well as strict requirements.  The authors have designed          a generalization of the CLP scheme, Hierarchical Constraint Logic               Programming (HCLP), which allows a programmer to express both required          and preferential constraints, with an arbitrary number of strengths of          preference.  Development of HCLP will continue on the practical side,           a goal is to improve the implementation of an instance of the language          scheme, including incorporating efficient constraint solvers and                adding new ways of comparing potential solutions.  Its utility will be          tested by using interactive graphics, as well as document formatting,           decision support, and scheduling, as test applications.  On the                 theoretical side, it is planned to extend the constraint hierarchy              formalism to include read-only variables and partially ordered                  hierarchies.",
