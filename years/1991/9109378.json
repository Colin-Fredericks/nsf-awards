 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research involves the integration of computer-aided design                 (CAD) methods and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) for the                    production of radial plate and axial barrel cams.  Piecewise                    continuous rational polynomials will be investigated as suitable                functions for both design and manufacture of cams.  Traditional                 methods as well as recently developed spline-based design                       strategies do not present an integrated, geometrically based system             for design and manufacture.                                                          The objectives to be realized during the grant include:                    Development of an understanding of the mathematical foundations of              rational polynomial functions currently used in the computer aided              design environment; investigation of typical control systems used               by industrial cam manufacturers and identification of methods for               interfacing CAD systems with CAM controllers to achieve high order              motion control in the manufacturing phase; and Development of                   experience with the design of standard cam motion programs and                  contours using rational polynomial curves.",
