 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. So-Young Pi,                         Department of Physics, Boston University, to pursue with Dr.                    Jae Hyung Yee, Department  of Physics, Yonsei University,                       Korea, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative                      research on gauge field theories in the Schrodinger picture.                    The Schrodinger picture method for obtaining information from                   quantum field theories will be further developed, and                           this method will be applied to gauge theories and to some                       (2+1)-dimensional models, particularly those involving                          Chern-Simons terms.                                                                                                                                             The success of quantum electrodynamics and the standard model                   for electro-weak and strong interactions shows that the quantum                 field theory  is the most reliable framework for describing                     subatomic phenomena.  The Schrodinger picture formulation of                    this theory gives the best physical picture of the subatomic                    world but mathematical problems with it only recently have                      been understood.  The collaborators have used this approach                     successfully in prior research under NSF Grant No. INT-8807985.                 They expect this research to produce discoveries and an                         understanding of the structure of various quantum field                         theories.  The PI and her collaborator are highly respected                     scientists in the field of the research and have a record of                    successful collaboration.  This project is relevant to the                      objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                        which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                        U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange                   of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and                    through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Dr. Yee's                 participation in  the project is supported by the Korea                         Science and Engineering Foundation  (KOSEF).",
