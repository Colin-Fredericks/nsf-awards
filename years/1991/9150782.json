 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new introductory biology course that begins the training of                   biology majors and meets the general education science                          requirement for non-majors.  Significant biological content is                  presented within the following pedagogical framework.  First,                   students are introduced to the fundamental methodological and                   philosophical principles of science, including: controlled                      experiments, analysis of historical evidence, modeling and                      simulation, drawing correlations, statistical inference, and                    reasoning by analogy.  Second, students are introduced to the                   history of biology, to provide them with an appreciation for                    how scientific discoveries have actually been made, and provide                 insights into how contemporary scientists go about their work.                  Third, students consider the social context of science, because                 if students are to think critically about the important                         scientific issues of today, they must realize that science                      interacts with other social institutions in complex ways.                       Fourth, students learn about science by doing science.  The                     laboratory portion of the course is designed to give students                   hands-on experience with research techniques.  Students learn                   to identify research problems, formulate hypotheses, design                     methods of testing, analyze assumptions, interpret results, and                 present findings for peer review.  Fifth, students are given                    the opportunity to develop the thinking and communication                       skills that are the hallmarks of the educated individual.  This                 framework produces greater understanding of biological concepts                 and provides intellectual tools for life-long learning.",
