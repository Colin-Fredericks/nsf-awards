 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographers and other scientists have focused considerable attention         on dramatic recent changes in the structure and location of economic            activities.  Because a major dimension of those changes has been the            development of more complex international interconnections, researchers         examining the dynamic economic geographies of specific regions                  increasingly have found themselves working more closely with colleagues         in foreign nations.  The International Geographical Union's Committee on        Industrial Change has been an important organization helping geographers        in different nations to relate research activities and to develop               collaborative research projects.  In August 1992, this committee will           meet in Orlando, Florida, for a five-day meeting at which research              papers will be presented, plans for future activities will be made, and         high-technology industrial operations in central Florida will be                studied.  A conference proceedings will enable scientists not in                attendance at the conference to benefit directly from its presentations         and deliberations.  This award provide partial support to assist in the         planning and operations of that meeting.                                           This conference will convene geographers and related scientists to           share their current perspectives and insights about an important topic.         In addition to bringing together scholars from across the globe who have        had relatively little opportunity for focused, face-to-face discussions,        the project also will provide opportunities for identification of new           lines of basic research and for development of international                    collaborative research projects.",
