 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a collaboration to make high energy gamma                   ray observations in the Southern Hemisphere between Dr. Trevor                  C. Weekes of the Smithsonian-Astrophysics Observatory and Dr.                   Jorge Sahade and Dr. Hugo Levato both of La Plata University                    in Argentina.  They will explore the Galaxy's emission at                       all energies, and establish a TeV observatory in the southern                   hemisphere.  Sensitive ground-based observations of some of the                 Galaxy can only be made from the southern hemisphere.  No                       such facility now exists.  The proposed Argentine observing                     site will be an excellent one for the purpose.                                                                                                                  The U.S. program in gamma ray astronomy will be benefitted by                   the proposed research in that TeV observations of the Galaxy                    will be conducted at a sensitivity not feasible from within                     the U.S.  It is clear that this will be a genuinely cooperative                 piece of research, beneficial not only to the U.S., but to                      Argentine astrophysicists as well.  The latter will be                          trained in a technique that is new to them, work with modern                    equipment and will do most of the actual observing.  Further,                   a good working relationship will be furthered between the                       U.S. and Argentine communities in high energy astronomy.",
