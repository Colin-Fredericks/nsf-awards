 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to explore the ethical issues that arise             when computer decision procedures (which can also be thought of as              computer models) are applied in decisions affecting the public                  interest.  These systems have become pervasive; examples include                air-traffic control, forest service planning, military conflict                 simulations, and so forth.  The development and use of these models             raise ethical issues, but these issues are often hidden by the                  technical nature of the models.  In this project, the investigators             will examine two real world cases; one will be computer decision                procedures (CDPs) used in pension plan decision making.  This                   investigation will identify, classify, and analyse ethical issues               in the development and use of these models.  It will search for                 generic issues that are likely to be common to many models, and                 explore ways to ensure that the ethical issues are addressed in the             future.  The analysis will examine ethical issues that arise for                the designers, the decision makers, and the public.  With respect               to each group, analyses will be developed from the standpoint of                different ethical theories and frameworks, and their implications               for action will be identified.  This process can lead to                        suggestions for change in policy or procedure for modellers and                 modelling.  For example, a concern for paternalism and consent                  would lead to the recommendation that CDPs be developed in ways                 that are transparent to clients or users.  Results will include                 presentations at professional society meetings and publications in              appropriate journals.                                                                                                                                           The topic of this proposal is of highest priority for Ethics and                Values Studies.  The qualifications and track record of these                   investigators are excellent.  The project provides an important                 test for theories and methodologies to study ethical issues in                  development and applications of computer models.  Results will be               useful for a wide range of individuals and groups.  The budget is               modest.  The proposal is recommended for support.",
