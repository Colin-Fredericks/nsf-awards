 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for                Undergraduates Site at the Department of Biochemistry at the                    University of Arizona for another three years.  NSF funds will                  provide stipends for nine students with the University of Arizona               providing stipends for an additional ten students.  Students will               apply to the REU program and once selected by a faculty/student                 committee, they interview several of the 110 participating                      faculty sponsors before deciding with whom they wish to work.                   This matching process insures that students will be working on a                problem that is of interest to them and fosters a productive                    working relationship.  Students then pursue their research                      problems as part of a research group.  In addition to students'                 research, lab meetings and seminars, the program offers an                      orientation that includes radiation and laboratory safety                       training and a weekly brown bag lunch where students and faculty                discuss issues and careers in biology and biological research.                  There is an annual Undergraduate Biology Research Conference and                an Undergraduate Biology Colloquium Series featuring world                      renowned biologists.  The common thread that unites the program                 is that students are all involved in independent research on some               problem in biology.",
