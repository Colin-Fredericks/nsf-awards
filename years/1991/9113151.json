 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is an investigation of the mechanisms of heat                        transfer associated with plume formation occurring during the                   interaction of laser radiation with metal targets.  The                         primary objective of the study is the development of                            techniques which can be used to determine the relative                          importance of plume absorption, scattering, and emission on                     coupling of laser energy into metal targets.  The methods used                  include high speed photography, target temperature                              measurement, plume light scattering and transmission                            measurements, and calibrated plume emission spectroscopy.  A                    pulsed Nd-YAG laser is used as the primary source of incident                   laser radiation at flux levels of 105 W/cm2 and greater.                        Aluminum and aluminum alloy materials are used as targets.                                                                                                      Another objective of this study is the investigation of the                     role of the assist gas on plume ionization and coupling of                      laser energy into the workpiece.  The influence of molecular                    oxygen on degree of plume ionization is studied by performing                   tests in various atmospheres with and without molecular                         oxygen.  The significance of this study is that a clearer                       understanding of the heat transfer mechanisms associated with                   plume formation is expected to be obtained.  This study will                    help accomplish the long term goal of this research program                     which is to provide an understanding of heat transfer                           mechanisms in laser target interaction so that lasers may be                    utilized to their full advantage in materials processing.",
