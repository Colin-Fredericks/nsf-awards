 "awd_abstract_narration": "A numerical and theoretical study of the motion of deformable                   drops in flow through circular tubes is proposed.  This                         investigation incorporates the effects of finite inertia and                    surfactant impurities. A modified version of the continuum                      surface force (CFS) model is developed which accounts for the                   transport of insoluble surfactant in the deformed surface of                    the drop.  The modified CSF model is used to obtain numerical                   solutions for the drop deformation and speed, as well as the                    additional pressure loss in the tube due to the presence of                     the drop.  The drop shape and its velocity relative to the                      average velocity of the two-phase system are measured                           in vertical glass tubes wherein the motion of the drop through                  the tube is visualized, and then compared to numerical                          solutions.                                                                                                                                                      The results of the proposed study will enhance our                              understanding of the motion of drops in pipe flow.  In                          addition, the development of the modified CSF model will allow                                                                                                  the application of this model to the solution of other                          problems involving fluid-fluid interfaces.",
