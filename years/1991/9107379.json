 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emergent, floating, and submersed aquatic plants show a                    characteristic but unexplained zonation by depth in lakes                       throughout the world.  The PI proposes to test a new hypothesis                 to account for this pattern in terms of competition, as                         influenced by differences between growth forms in leaf height,                  allocation to relatively unproductive support tissue, and                       ability to maintain a positive whole-plant carbon balance at                    different depths.  This hypothesis accounts for several trends                  (including some recently documented) in zonation as a function                  of environmental conditions and plant characteristics.  Field                   manipulations are proposed to determine:                                             Whether emergents competitively exclude floating species                   from shallow water (based on removal experiments);                                   Whether emergent and floating species are near net annual                  growth at their maximum depths (based on measurements on cutting                transplanted to a variety of depths);                                                Whether the observed pattern of decline in net growth  with                depth is attributed to increased allocation to support tissue                   (based on studies of leaf demography, the allometry of support                  tissue, and tissue construction costs as a function of                          depth);                                                                              Whether dense beds of submersed plants limit the maximum                   depth of water in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes (based on                     removal experiments); and                                                            Whether large-leaved waterlilies (e.g., Nymphaea)                          competitively exclude smaller-leaved floating species (e.g.,                    Brasenia, Potamogeton) from shallow water via aggressive                        competition ( mechanical abrasion) or leaf overriding (based on                 removal experiments and analysis of leaf overlap and leaf                       demography where the two groups co-occur).  These experiments                   would be conducted in a representative subset (Helen Lake, Wind                 Pudding Lake, Wildcat Lake, Beautiful Lake) of a 10-lake                        fertility gradient that is currently the subject of comparative                 studies.",
