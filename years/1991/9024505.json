 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is to (1) determine the herpetofaunal                     diversity of the remnant rainforests of Madagascar; (2) determine               the distribution and relative abundance of the component species;               (3) estimate the systematic relationships of species and genera                 based on cladistic and phenetric analyses of morphological,                     genetic, chromosomal, behavioral, and life history data; (4) use                cladistic methods to analyze biogeographic patterns within                      Madagascar; (5) determine the ex-Madagascan sister groups of the                endemic rainforest genera in conjunction with an analysis of the                origin of the herpetofauna; (6) produce monographs, keys, and field             guides that will be useful to land managers charged with                        conservation of the Madagascan fauna; (7) compile a data base of                distribution records to identify conservation priorities; and (8)               train Malagasy students in the disciplines of herpetology and field             biology.  Some collateral objectives are to initiate a study of                 sexual selection, speciation, and vocalization in the two most                  diverse frog genera Boohis and Mantidactylus; study antipredator                mechanisms in microhylid toads; compile ecological and life history             data for all rainforest species; help to establish a well-curated               collection of amphibians and reptiles at Madagascar's National Zoo              and National University; and provide information and                            recommendations to Malagasy officials regarding conservation of the             Madagascan herpetofauna.  There are 280 currently recognized                    species of rainforest amphibians and reptiles in Madagascar.  This              represents 70 percent of the total Madagascan herpetofauna and at               least 50 percent of Madagascar's endemic species of terrestrial                 vertebrates.  Thus, the rainforest herpetofauna is an extremely                 important component of the endemic vertebrate fauna of Madagascar.              It is crucial that herpetofaunal survey be done now, because it is              well documented that the Madagascan rainforest is disappearing                  (even in reserves) at a rate of about 111,000 hectares annually.                The proposed research would have a major impact on rainforest                   conservation initiatives.",
