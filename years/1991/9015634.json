 "awd_abstract_narration": "On every list of outstanding astrophysical problems in the late                 twentieth century is the \"solar neutrino problem.\"  This problem                refers to the measured low rate of neutrino production in the Sun               compared to rates expected from theoretical interior models of                  the Sun.  Since the rate of neutrinos generated is proportional                 to the thermonuclear energy rate in the Sun, there is a keen                    interest to confirm our basic understanding of what makes the Sun               shine.  The discrepancy between the observed and predicted rate                 calls this understanding into question, hence the term \"solar                   neutrino problem.\"  The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes a                  three-year continuation of his work in the Soviet-American                      Gallium Experiment (SAGE) located in the Bakyan Neutrino                        Laboratory in the Soviet Union.  This experiment will provide the               most sensitive test yet of solar interior and neutrino theories                 because it is sensitive to low and moderate energy neutrinos,                   whereas existing experiments (at Homestake, South Dakota and                    Kamiokande in Japan) are sensitive to the relatively few high                   energy neutrinos produced by side-nuclear reactions.  The SAGE                  experiment became operational in early 1990 and has already                     produced exciting results, an extreme dearth of neutrinos                       relative to the theoretical predictions.  If future monitoring of               the Sun with more sensitive equipment confirms these early                      results, then either our understanding of the Sun's interior                    structure or the fundamental nature of neutrinos must be changed.               The PI has played a vital role in constructing the proportional                 counter detectors for the SAGE experiment.  The PI proposes to                  continue this role both because the old detectors deteriorate                   with time and also because more detectors will provide a more                   sensitive test of the neutrino discrepancy.  In addition, these                 detectors provide a means of discriminating between bonafide                    solar neutrinos and neutrinos produced by alternate processes on                the Earth.  Thus, the PI's efforts will help to define the extent               of the neutrino discrepancy, leading to its earlier resolution.",
