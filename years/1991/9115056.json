 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supported under NSF's \"Small Grants for Exploratory             Research (SGER)\" Program and jointly by the Structural Systems and              Construction Processes and Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Program.                The objective of this project is to explore the feasibility and                 applicability of electrorheological fluids (ER) as a semiactive                 scheme for vibration control of structures.  The approach is to use             a simple system whose control parameters, damping and stiffness                 coefficients, dependent on the ER fluid, are varied in real time                through control of the electric field.  a multidisciplinary                     approach is undertaken in which both experimental and analytical                tasks will conducted.  The analytical model takes into account the              nonlinear dynamics of this problem.  A nonlinear control scheme                 will be developed, based on the constructive use of Lyapunov                    stability theory.  Such a controller is efficient in computation                time (essential for real time applications) and, in addition,                   handles nonlinear dynamics.  ER materials characterization and                  response will be measured using the experimental arrangement.  One              important result of the research, in addition to demonstration the              advantages of semiactive control for structural vibration, is that              it will provide guidelines for the requirements of suitable ER                  fluids for such applications.  This investigation explores, for the             first time, the feasibility of ER scheme for use in controlling the             dynamic structural response and assesses its potentials in solving              seismic, wind, or machine-induced vibration problems.",
