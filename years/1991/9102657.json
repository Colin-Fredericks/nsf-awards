 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research program, self-assembling arrays of molecules will              be constructed that are photoactive and will mimic some of the                  essential features of natural light harvesting complexes.                       Porphyrin chromophores will be assembled so as to form antennae                 that facilitate energy migration between porphyrin molecules and                subsequent energy transfer to a trap, where a chemical reaction                 can be initiated. Each antenna will be assembled by spontaneous                 self-association, by multi-point hydrogen bonding of heterocycles               that are covalently bonded to the porphyrin ring. One, two, or                  four such heterocycles will be bonded to a single porphyrin ring                such that dimers, polymolecular ribbons, cyclomers, and three-                  dimensional supramolecular arrays will result. In this manner,                  highly oriented structures will be formed in solution, in a                     mesophoric phase, or in the solid state, each of which has                      discrete porphyrin chromophores positioned within the critical                  distance for excitation energy migration and transfer.                          %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research              of Dr. Anthony M. Harriman at the University of Texas, Austin. The              harvesting of light energy for the synthesis of molecules by                    plants, whereby chlorophyll is the energy harvesting system, is of              obvious importance. This is a complex process in nature, where an               array of chlorophyll molecules are assembled for the task of light              harvesting.  The porphyrin ring portion of chlorophyll is the                   light absorbing unit. In this project, porphyrin rings will be                  self-assembled and the transfer of light energy from the porphyrin              ring to an appended energy trapping moiety will be studied. This                system will serve to mimic the natural light harvesting system.",
