 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research program consists of two                                   main parts, i.e., solitary waves (ultrafast pulses)                             generation and switching operation in four-wave                                 mixing.  For solitary wave generation, the medium                               parameters such as loss and the nonlinear factor in                             MQWs will be measured and their effects on the                                  results will be taken into account in the                                       experiments.  This part of the research is expected                             to produce effective pulse compressors for ultrafast                            laser spectroscopy and diagnoses, and for high-rate                             optical communications.  The proposed study of                                  switching devices will include experimental                                     implementations of switching in four-wave mixing                                with different pump formats (forward, counter-                                  propagation with one or two pumps).  The                                        dependence of the outputs of the switching                                      processes on the material parameters and the                                    control signal will be studied using samples with                               different parameters.  The input power                                          requirements, and response time of MQW devices                                  will be measured experimentally using different                                 input power levels and delays between the input                                 and output pulses.  The use of the switching devices                            in cascade and array formats will be demonstrated                               using several pieces of MQWs in the experiments.",
