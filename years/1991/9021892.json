 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office to Ball State University              provides funds for the repair and renovation of the Cooper Physical             Building which houses that institution's research and research                  training activities in chemistry.  This building was constructed in             1965 and last renovated in 1978.  The ARFMP grant of $120,000 and               $142,879 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to                modernize these research and research training facilities of the                Department of Chemistry.  This project will address the need to                 improve the current research infrastructure both in terms of health             and safety and of the quality of research that can be conducted by              providing larger, more efficient fume hoods and an upgraded                     ventilation system.                                                                                                                                             This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of chemical                   synthesis research and for the training of quality undergraduate                students in a department with a particular commitment to                        increasing the number of minority and nontraditional majors                     graduated.",
