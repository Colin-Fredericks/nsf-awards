 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program is funding the research of Dr.                    Herbert C. Brown to continue his pioneering development of new                  chiral chemistry based on organoboranes.  The work will lead to                 the development of new methods for the stereospecific synthesis                 of special groupings of atoms called functional groups.  These                  are important for the development of new efficient routes to                    the complex materials needed in our economy.                                                                                                                    Research on organoboranes has extended the applicability to the                 synthesis of cyclic, polycyclic and various partially alkylated                 organoboranes.  The reactions of organoboranes proceed                          predominantly with complete retention of configuration.  This                   development makes it highly desirable to discover new reactions                 leading to other valuable compounds not now available from                      organoboranes.  The utility of various homologating agents                      generated in situ in the presence of an organoborane will be                    explored for the homologation of boracyclanes, vinyl-and                        alkynylboronate esters, bi- and polycyclic boracyclanes and                     tertiary alkylboronate esters.  The synthetic utility of a new                  three-carbon homologation procedure will be investigated for                    the preparation of alpha-vinyl boronate esters, medium- and                     large-ring boracyclanes and as well as their conversion to the                  corresponding medium- and large-ring ketones, amines and                        ethers.  New reactions will be sought that will lead to                         valuable compounds not now available from organoboranes, such                   as mercaptans, nitriles, organophosphorous compounds, etc.  The                 synthesis of various stereodefined vinyl organoboranes and                      their utility in the synthesis of stereodefined dienes, enynes                  and gamma, delta-unsaturated ketones will also be investigated.",
