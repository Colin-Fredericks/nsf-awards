 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project looks at the work of small-firm and solo legal                   practitioners as they confront new opportunities to market and                  advertise services, incorporate innovative ways to computerize                  offices, and respond to the entry of women into the labor                       market.  In various and complicated ways, each of these                         developments captures essential themes of the late twentieth                    century and challenges traditional professional practices.  The                 ways in which these legal practitioners describe and understand                 their life-style, values, aspirations, expectations, and                        commitments provide an entry point for examining contemporary                   economic, political, and social values of urban America.                          This effort addresses a significant and little-studied issue                  in law and social science, how developments in marketing,                       technology, and the participation of women in the law labor                     force have affected small and solo practitioner firms. It                       furthers VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for                    women to advance their careers in science or engineering                        through research, and to encourage other women to pursue                        careers in these areas through the investigators' enhanced                      visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In this                        project, the proposed activities which contribute to the second                 objective include:  teaching a graduate course in the sociology                 department, and giving seminars at the law school, sociology                    department, and Center for the Study of Women.",
