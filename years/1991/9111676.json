Parents play a critical role in structuring and              monitoring their children's activities outside the home, yet there              has been little examination of this role.  This research planning               project will to develop a plan to examine parents' actions in                   choosing, supervising and intervening in children's organized                   leisure activities outside of the home in order to increase our                 understanding of the socialization process and broaden our view of              family life.  The goals of the planning period for this project are             the selection of research sites, pre-testing of interviews and                  observations of families and of adults involved in children's                   activities, the development of strategies for videotaping families              in their homes, and preparation for the fixed-response survey                   questionnaire.                                                                                                                                                       This research planning project sets the stage for research                 that will provide valuable information about the way in which                   parents bring their social resources to bear in assisting their                 children's performance.  This project also provides an excellent                opportunity for a promising young scholar to carefully lay the                  groundwork for her future line of research.",
