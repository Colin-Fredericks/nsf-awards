 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will facilitate continued cooperation between                        chemical engineers at Cornell University and Kyoto University.                  The project is part of a larger project in the field of                         molecular thermodynamics that includes research on fluids by                    means of the methods of statistical mechanics and computer                      simulation.  In previous research conducted by the two                          groups, the effect of molecular association on the properties                   of associating fluids has been studied by simulation for                        simple and realistic potential models.  This project will                       focus on studies of water and aqueous mixtures.  In particular,                 the scientists will carry out investigations on theoretical                     and simulation studies of water-methanol mixtures; molecular                    dynamics simulations of the behavior of water in microporous                    materials, including carbons, silicas, and clays; and                           simulations of rapid cooling in polyol-water mixtures.  The                     Cornell group, led by Professor Keith E. Gubbins and Professor                  Paulette Clancy, will provide expertise in the theoretical                      methods and simulation techniques for studying micropores and                   rapid cooling.  The Japanese group, under the leadership of                     Professor Koichiro Nakanishi, has complementary expertise in                    developing intermolecular potential models for these systems                    and in molecular dynamics techniques applied to aqueous                         mixtures.                                                                                                                                                       The long term aim of the research project is to understand                      fluids and fluid mixtures of associating molecules (involving                   H-bonds, charge-transfer complexes, etc.) in detail at the                      molecular level.  The approach has been based on the use of                     fundamental statistical, mechanical, mean-field and perturba-                   tion theories, as well as Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics                    computer simulations.  The simulations are used to test the                     theoretical predictions for a well-defined potential model,                     and also to investigate phenomena that are difficult or                         impossible to study by experiment.",
