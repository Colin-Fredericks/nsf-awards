 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is to begin to determine                 the degree of intra-specific variability in the social behavior                 of the black lemur (Lemur macaco macaco) of northwestern                        Madagascar.   There is some information on the behavioral                       characteristics of this species.  Yet, it is well known from                    studies of other nonhuman primates that great variability may be                encountered between conspecific populations due to ecological and               other causes.  The PIs will begin to assess the level of                        behavioral variability by observing four groups over the course                 of eighteen months.  As two of the populations reside in                        relatively undisturbed areas and two in areas significantly                     disrupted by human activity, there will be ample opportunity to                 observe the range of black lemur behavior.                                                                                                                      The project will aim to document the responses to habitat                       disturbance.  Most specifically, disturbance leads to an altered                distribution of food sources,  which in turn may affect ranging                 patterns and male migrations between groups.  The latter will                   also be documented in reference to mating patterns.  As female                  lemurs dominate males, the effects of migration on female choice                of mates and other aspects of mating strategies will be of                      interest.",
