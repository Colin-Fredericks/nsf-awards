 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite numerous systematic studies, the relationships among               many species within the dog family Canidae remain unresolved.                   Two areas of continued disagreement are the wolf-like species (in               the genera Canis, Cuon,Lycaon, and Speothos) and the South                      American species (in 5-7 genera).  Together the two groups                      include some 20 species, or more than half of those within the                  family Canidae.  Previous work based on morphology, allozyme                    variation, and karyology have failed to provide a consistent                    picture of relationships among these taxa.  In large part, the                  lack of success of the molecular analyses was due to the close                  relationships among many of these species.  Associations among                  such closely related taxa are best studied with more fine-scale                 molecular analyses, such as those based on mitochondrial DNA                    sequence data.  Here, it is proposed to test several specific                   hypotheses concerning the systematics of these taxa using                       phylogenetic analysis of approximately 850 base pairs of                        mitochondrial DNA sequence obtained by polymerase chain                         amplification (PCR) of genomic DNA.  Because the mitochondrial                  DNA sequence of mammals evolves quickly (5-10 times faster than                 the average nuclear sequence), it is particularly appropriate for               the study of closely related species.  Many of these canid                      species have been the focus of comparative studies of carnivore                 behavior and thus resolution of their relationships will                        illuminate the potential effects of ancestry on observed                        patterns.",
