 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the research is to study the feasibility of                 nanocrystalline Nb3A1 formation by mechanically alloying                        elemental powders.  Nb3A1 intermetallic was chosen for its                      highest temperature capability among structural aluminides as                   well as for its high current density property as a                              superconductor.  The appeal of mechanical alloying for the                      synthesis of Nb3A1 intermetallics stems from its capability to                  make alloys with controlled microstructure via solid-state                      processing.  This is particularly important for Nb and A1 which                 have large differences in melting points and densities thereby                  causing conventional melting techniques to be difficult,                        hazardous and less controllable.  In addition, mechanical                       alloying has the potential of obtaining very fine grain sizes,                  eventually in the nanometer  range that hold the promise for                    properties greatly exceeding those of conventionally processed                  intermetallic compounds.  The  main benefit of nanostructure                    processing -superplasticity- is more rewarding for intermetallics               that are usually known for their complete lack of ductility and                 formability.  Consequently, the benefits of Nb3A1 as a very high                temperature resistant, relatively less dense and oxidation                      resistant material may be fully used in industrial and aerospace                applications.                                                                        These alloys are extremely interesting in both                             superconducting and in aerospace/structural applications and                    could be widely used if their ductility could be improved.",
