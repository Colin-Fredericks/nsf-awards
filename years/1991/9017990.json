 "awd_abstract_narration": "Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and Carnegie Mellon University                (CMU) are pleased to cooperate in a three-year program of                       research on autonomous underwater robots.  The use of remotely                  controlled, tethered underwater vehicles to routinely perform                   critical underwater tasks in offshore and ocean situations has                  clearly demonstrated both the utility and importance of these                   systems.  Recent developments in autonomous vehicle and robot                   technology now form the basis for projecting that significant                   expansions are possible in the capabilities of underwater                       vehicles and robotics.  The technologies involved are wide                      ranging and include sensors, controls, power, computing,                        architectures and data representation.                                                                                                                          The coordinated research program will focus on map-based                        knowledge representation to directly address several of these                   central issues of autonomous underwater vehicles.  We will                      develop methods to build, store, and use the knowledge that                     autonomous vehicles need to execute useful missions.                            Specifically, we will develop \"annotated maps\", which index                     information to particular objects and locations in the map.  The                annotations can be used for a wide variety of purposes:                         describing objects, providing hints for perception or control, or               specifying particular actions to be taken.  We will provide a                   query mechanism to retrieve annotations based on their map                      locations.  We will also build \"triggers\", which will cause a                   specified message to be delivered to a particular process when                  the vehicle reaches a given location in the map.  These annotated               maps will serve a crucial role in enabling missions that are                    currently beyond the reach of autonomous systems.",
