 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new view of sea-floor spreading center processes is emerging                  from integration of detailed bathymetric, geophysical, and                      petrological data sets. Variations in the supply of magma along                 the ridge axis appears to play a fundamental role in controlling                morphologic, tectonic, seismic and geochemical \"segmentation\" of                spreading centers. Such magmatic segmentation has profound                      implications for hydrothermal processes which are controlled by                 the thermal and permeability characteristics of the newly formed                crust.                                                                                                                                                          The present project will support a detailed examination of                      hydrothermal processes along the East Pacific Rise south of the                 Clipperton Transform Fault. This section of ridge has been                      extensively studied using standard geologic and geophysical                     techniques. Only data on the chemistry and nature of vent fluids                to be gathered by this project is lacking for this ridge segment.               Additionally, future drilling is planned which will provide a                   depth perspective on volcanic and hydrothermal processes. These                 additional data will provide the first  complete three                          dimensional characterization of a ridge crest spreading segment.                Additional work to be accomplished during Alvin dives in this                   study includes: structural mapping, basalt sampling, and                        evaluation of specific sites for future drilling.",
