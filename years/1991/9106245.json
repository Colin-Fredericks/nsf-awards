 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to learn more about the structure,             function and regulation of enzymes in pea nuclei that are                       stimulated by phytochrome.  Phytochrome stimulates the activity of              nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) in purified pea nuclei, and                  calcium ions are necessary for this response.  A calmodulin-                    dependent 47 kD NTPase has been isolated from pea nuclei and shown              to have properties that implicate it as being the nuclear NTPase                that is regulated by phytochrome.  This NTPase appears to be                    closely related to a lamin-derived 46 kD NTPase in mammalian                    nuclei, whose activity is thought to be important for RNA export                from nuclei.  Additional sequence information on the plant NTPase               will be obtained to confirm or disprove this relationship.  There               is some evidence that the phosphorylation of lamins in animal                   nuclei plays a critical role in its controlled degradation by                   proteolysis.  The phosphorylation of the pea NTPase will be                     characterized, and its role both in the regulation of NTPase                    activity and in the production of NTPase from lamin-like precursors             will be examined.  The results should contribute to an improved                 understanding of how light can influence nuclear metabolism, with               possible implications also for models of how light regulates plant              gene expression.//",
