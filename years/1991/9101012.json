The materials involved have been isolated by                     researchers at South China University of Technology, and have                   proven to have significant corrosion inhibition properties.                     Under this project, characterization of the materials will                      occur at the University of Idaho, bringing expertise in                         electrochemical engineering and access to characterization                      equipment to bear on the question of how these materials                        inhibit corrosion.                                                                                                                                              This collaboration may lead to development of greatly                           improved corrosion inhibition agents from natural materials,                    replacing more costly materials derived from petroleum.  This                   project is supported under the U.S.-China Cooperative Science                   Program.",
