 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Katherine Hunt is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                 and Computational Chemistry Program to study the theory of                      transient, collision-induced changes in molecular dipoles and                   polarizabilities.  These studies will help spectroscopists to                   probe intermolecular dynamics of fluids on subpicosecond time                   scales which in turn will help them to elucidate solute-solvent                 interactions critically important to chemical reactions.                                                                                                        Dr. Hunt's theoretical work will help to determine transient,                   collision-induced changes in molecular dipoles and                              polarizabilities needed to extract dynamical information from                   observed line shapes.  For interacting molecules with slight                    charge overlap, she plans to perform calculations using a newly                 developed polarizability density theory which accounts for the                  intramolecular distribution of polarizability and for overlap                   damping, as well as dispersion, higher-multipole induction, and                 nonuniformity in the local electric field.  She will develop                    efficient methods for computing nonlocal response tensors,                      including nonlinear susceptibilities.  She will find                            physically-based approximations to these tensors, and carry out                 calculations of collision-induced properties that are important                 spectroscopically.  She plans to treat nonadditive                              exchange-polarization via a modified density-functional                         approach or exchange-perturbation theory.  Ab initio                            calculations will also be carried out for molecules with                        appreciable overlap.",
