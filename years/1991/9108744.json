 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of behavioral genetics has demonstrated that heredity                 influences differences among people for many aspects of behavior,               including cognitive abilities, personality, and psychopathology.                However, little is known about the extent to which genetic                      factors influence behavioral interactions for pairs of                          individuals.  From the perspective of child development, some of                the most important interactions are those within the family, yet                essentially nothing is known about such family relationships from               the perspective of behavioral genetics.                                                                                                                         This research will extend into early adolescence the Colorado                   Sibling Study (CSS) which focuses on the social environment of                  familial and extra-familial relationships.  The CSS has                         previously studied family relationships for nonadoptive and                     adoptive siblings in early and middle childhood.  This research                 on early adolescence will investigate nonshared environment and                 genetic influence on parent and sibling relationships.                                                                                                          This study is embedded within the long-term Colorado Adoption                   Project, which makes it possible to study antecedents and                       consequences of family relationships and to consider the role of                heredity in these associations.",
