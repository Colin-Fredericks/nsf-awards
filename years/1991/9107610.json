 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on a new area of research for Dr.                       Rakowski-DuBois.  She will spend a month at the beginning of                    the project interacting with research groups which are active                   in the area on metal nitrogen chemistry.  She will obtain a                     better sense of properties and potential reactions of these                     complexes and get a better perspective on important problems in                 organometallic chemistry.  During this period she will have                     access to original material not readily available at the                        University of Colorado.  Following this, a major portion of the                 project period will be spent in her own laboratory where                        syntheses of new metalorgano-nitrogen complexes and their                       reactions can be explored most efficiently.  She will renew her                 her synthetic expertise  with hands-on research during this                     period, and will acquaint herself with new instrumentation,                     software, and new experimental techniques.  In the latter part                  of this project she will spend an extended period of time in                    laboratories at the University of Texas gaining experience in                   photochemical techniques and exploring a collaborative                          investigation of organometallic nitrogen and oxo complexes and                  clusters.  The remaining period of this project will be devoted                 to developing new techniques and collaborations in her research                 group at Colorado.                                                              %%%                                                                             This Career Advancement Award will support activities that will                 expand Dr. Mary Rakowski-DuBois' research career potential.                     The scope and intent of this award will provide for the                         development of new skills in areas that will expand her                         research programs and develop innovative research methods in                    collaborations with other investigators.",
