As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                    Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                     Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                 initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                 of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                  properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                 geospace model with predictive capability.                                           The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                             magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                   connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                   ionosphere.  This grant is for support to place an imaging                      riometer at Sundrostrom, Greenland to be used in conjunction with               GEM activities.  Specifically, this grant will investigate the                  nature of transient dayside precipitation regions and the                       relationship to other short-lived ionospheric perturbations near                and within the high-latitude cusp region.  ***",
