 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR) for the repair and               renovation of the Conklin Laboratories which house research and                 research training activities in biology, chemistry, and                         oceanography.  This building was constructed in 1961 and last                   renovated in 1980.  The ARFMP grant of $200,000 and $238,725                    provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize               these research and research training facilities.  This project                  will address the need to improve the current research                           infrastructure so as to strengthen existing programs and encourage              more sophisticated research.  The renovation will provide high                  standards of power, solvent and chemical storage, seawater, and                 computer network infrastructure in a location which presents                    particularly difficult problems for many areas of laboratory                    operations.                                                                                                                                                     This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved research and research training environment                to an increasing number of scientists and students wishing to take              advantage of the key location of BBSR for the pursuit of new                    initiatives in global geosciences and marine molecular biology.",
