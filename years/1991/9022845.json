 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographic information systems (GISs) have provided profound               advances in computational capacities to store, manipulate, and present          spatial data over the last few decades, and their continued development         in future years will continue to affect the ways that people view and           analyze spatial patterns and processes.  Rapidly increasing use of GISs         has been matched by development of increasingly detailed spatial                databases.  These databases contain enormous amounts of information,            which greatly enhances possibilities for addressing fundamental                 scientific questions, but their size and complexity makes                       identification of which data are appropriate for specific analyses much         more difficult.  Sophisticated procedures for accessing relevant data           for focused inquiries are being developed, but much less attention has          been given to development of procedures for summary visual analysis of          related spatial data.  Just as many geographic patterns and processes           have been identified and analyzed through visual comparisons of hard-           copy maps, comparable means are needed for exploring \"electronic                atlases.\"  This project will address the theoretical and software               requirements to permit orderly investigations of multi-temporal                 spatial databases.  Using knowledge about systematic variations in              geographic and temporal data, the investigator will develop several             procedures for the automatic generation of sequences of maps,                   statistical diagrams, and other graphics for detecting and highlighting         salient spatial relationships.  Special attention will be given to              development of an interactive graphic interface, which will allow               database users to control the pace and direction of the analysis and to         focus on specific patterns, relationships, or places.  New procedures           developed during this process will be assessed during focus-group               discussions with academics and practitioners.                                        This project should contribute to expansion of theoretical                 frameworks dealing with the presentation and analysis of spatial data.          It also will contribute directly to development of software and other           technological advances that ultimately will enhance the research and            educational capabilities of a large number of scientists and                    practitioners who use geographic data.",
