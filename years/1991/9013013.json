 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is the development of an integrated set               of tools for the logical and physical design of sequential circuits             with reduced area and improved performance.  The proposed research              is developing analytical techniques for synthesis of sequential                 circuits by means of functional and physical decompositions so as               to minimize the area and maximize the performance (or find a trade              off between the two).  Algorithms to decompose a sequential circuit             into a set of interacting synchronous finite state machines (FSM's)             are being investigated.  The approach is to find a set of                       generalized partitions of machine states, so that each machine                  state can be implemented as a separate machine.  The machines                   corresponding to those partitions interact with each other in a                 more complex fashion than those derived on the basis of classical               theory of closed partitions.  For example, in this organization one             machine may depend on other machines by using their state bits as               primary inputs.",
