 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a pilot research project to evaluate the natural                   variability of monthly precipitation and use these estimates to                 1) evaluate General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations of                      present-day precipitation variability and 2) determine whether                  and where GCM-forecasts of terrestrial precipitation changes                    under doubled Carbon Dioxide scenarios will be first detected.                  This assessment will be obtained by compiling a pilot data base                 of monthly precipitation totals from terrestrial stations and                   removing \"gage-induced\" biases (including the effect of the wind,               wetting on the interior walls of the gage, and evaporation form                 the gage) by an empirically-based method.  As surface air                       temperature, wind speed, and humidity are required to facilitate                the gage corrections, the database also will contain observations               of these climatological variables.  Missing observations of both                air temperature and wind speed will be interpolated both                        spatially and temporally.  Digital filtering procedures then will               be used to obtain areally-averaged estimates of precipitation                   that are compatible with the GCM resolutions.  The natural                      variability in monthly precipitation will be computed and used                  to calculate signal-to-noise and compared with a number of                      general circulation models.  These results then will be used to                 determine where (if anywhere) Carbon Dioxide-induced changes in                 precipitation will be detectable and consequently, important.",
