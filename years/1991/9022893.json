 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wellesley College has supported a herbarium for more than a                century, and the Wellesley lichen collections are historically                  important for systematic and ecological research.  Recent changes               in the composition of the biology faculty at Wellesley have left                the herbarium without an appropriate curator.  The College                      decided to discontinue its support for the herbarium in the late                1980's, and in 1988 the collection (70,000 vascular plants and                  20,000 cryptogams) was transferred to the New York Botanical                    Garden (NYBG).  Dr. J. Kallunki, Curator at NYBG, proposes to                   repair specimens, transfer them to new sheets and folders, and                  integrate them into the Garden's herbarium.                                          Systematic collections such as the Wellesley herbarium are                 critical resources for the study of biological diversity.  The                  long-term maintenance and growth of natural history collections                 are essential for future generations of research.  The New York                 Botanical Garden's willingness to incorporate the Wellesley                     herbarium will protect it from an uncertain future, and will make               it available to the research community in a timely fashion.",
