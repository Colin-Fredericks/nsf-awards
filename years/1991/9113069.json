 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecological discussions of environmental change have                     emphasized either physiological responses of individual organisms               or ecosystem.level responses of entire trophic levels and                       functional groups.  Largely missing from these discussions has                  been significant input from the domain of classical population,                 evolutionary, and community ecology.  Yet these fields should be                playing a key role in discussions of the ecological consequences                of environmental change.  Population and community interactions                 serve as links by which the physiological consequences of                       environmental change are integrated into ecosystem.level                        responses.  Moreover, evolutionary and community ecology have                   recently developed a rich empirical and theoretical foundation                  that has the promise of catalyzing..perhaps even directly                       offering..predictions about long.term consequences of massive                   climatic and land.use shifts.                                                           This workshop is being held to address the potential                    contributions of evolutionary, physiological, population, and                   community ecology to issues of environmental change.                            Participants will evaluate existing contributions as well as                    suggest directions for new research.  In addition, the workshop                 will attempt to link its findings to the physiological and                      ecosystem.level contributions that have emerged from previous                   ecological syntheses.                                                                   To share the evaluations with a large audience, the                     organizers will rapidly produce an edited book (to be published                 by a commercial publisher) that details the existing insights of                evolutionary and community ecology pertinent to environmental                   change, and that highlights and sets out directions for future                  research.  In addition, a brief summary of the report will be                   published in the Ecological Society of America's new publication,               \u001aEcological Applications\u001a, which will thus reach a wide readership              free of charge.  Finally, the participants will also prepare a                  concise summary of the workshop geared to a general nontechnical                audience; this \"layperson's\" report could be distributed among                  government officials by NSF.",
