 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the use of tellurium reagents for the                    production of enatiomerically pure organic compounds. By                        combining tellurium methodology with Sharpless kinetic                          resolutions or asymmetric epoxidations of allylic alcohols the                  following will be able to be achieved: (1) the synthesis of                     optically active secondary and tertiary allylic alcohols from                   achiral starting materials without resolution, (2) the                          synthesis of secondary cis allylic alcohols from trans                          compounds in high optical purity, (3) the conversion of                         racemic, secondary allylic alcohols to either enantiomer in                     high yield and high optical purity without the loss of material                 sustained in a kinetic resolution, (4) the deoxygenation of                     acetates of glycidols with retention of the chirality at the                    carbinol center, and (5) the transposition of double bond and                   alcohol functionalities in both the free alcohol as well as in                  the sulfonate esters of the allylic alcohols. Also,                             2-substitued allylic alcohols whose accessibility by other                      methods is difficult will be prepared and studied.                                                                                                              %%%                                                                                                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                  Division will support the research of Dr. Donald C. Dittmer of                  the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University. The                         research is in the area of synthetic methodology and will                       utilize tellurium reagents for the production of organic                        substrates in optically pure form. Using a variety of                           approaches the work will allow the preparation of these                         optically pure compounds from optically inactive starting                       materials. This process is extremely important in modern                        synthetic chemistry because many of the target molecules which                  have biological activity must be prepared optically active to                   study their properties.",
