 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attine ants (tribe Attini) are unique among ants in growing                                                                                                a symbiotic fungus for food.  The ecology of many species of                    attines has been studied extensively due to their economic and                  ecological importance.  Fundamental evolutionary questions,                     however, have remained unanswered due to poor understanding  of                 the phylogenetic relationships of the ants and of their fungi.  A                                                                                               study to establish the phylogeny of attines and of their fungi                  using molecular genetics in order to: 1) infer the origins of                   this obligate ant/fungi and the habits of the most closely                      related non-attine ants and fungi, and 2) determine whether the                 attine fungi have speciated in parallel with the ants will be                   conducted.  In such a case, the cladograms of the attine ants and                                                                                               their fungi should be exactly congruent.  This pattern would                    suggest that the different lines of attine ants have coevolved                  with their fungi in close mutual dependency.  Alternatively,                    disparities between the two cladograms may suggest that some                    attine lines have acquired new unrelated species of fungus to                   cultivate.  The nature of the disparities should provide insight                                                                                                into the coevolutionary interactions between the ants and their                 fungi.",
