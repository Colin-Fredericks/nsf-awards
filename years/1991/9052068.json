 "awd_abstract_narration": "The convergence of infrastructural and environmental crises with                a technological explosion is giving rise to vast expenditures of                public and private funds on land/spatial infrastructure                         information systems.  This in turn is creating a burgeoning need                for professionals trained in the design, implementation, and                    management of these systems.  These social and technological                    dynamics exert enormous pressure on education institutions to                   respond to change and more importantly, to help shape positive                  change.  In civil and environmental engineering, effective course               offerings, and curricula, methods of instruction depend upon                    state-of-the-art instructional laboratories which keep pace, as                 best as practical with technological innovation.  This project                  aims to upgrade equipment in surveying engineering and land                     information studies laboratories.  Specifically, the project                    seeks to acquire electronic angle and distance measurement                      systems (total stations) for state-of-the-art three dimensional                 field data collection, and computer equipment/software for modern               laboratory data processing, analysis, design and graphics                       presentations.  This equipment will enable changes to be                        incorporated into our instructional programs to meet the                        challenges of these rapidly changing times.  The project not only               responds to the current situation, it attempts to anticipate                    future requirements for civil and surveying engineers and the                   associated land information management problems.  It will have a                direct impact upon twelve courses and as many as 1100 students                  over the next five years.",
