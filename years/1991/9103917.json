 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Stryker will focus his studies on developing new                            carbon-carbon bond making reactions using transition metal                      organometallic complexes which permit the regioselective                        addition of nucleophilic reagents to the central carbon of                      certain eta-3-allyl complexes.  Thus, the regioselectivity                      normally observed in such nucleophilic additions will be                        reversed along with an inversion of the natural electron demand                 shown by allylic electrophiles.  The resulting                                  metallacyclobutane complexes represent an important                             organometallic structural class.  The PI will study the                         mechanism of the reaction by probing the nature of the metal,                   its oxidation state, coordination geometry, the ancillary                       ligand set and the nucleophile.  Manipulation of alkylative                     metallacyclobutane formation is anticipated to lead to the                      development of useful organic synthetic methodology.                            %%%                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program will support the                  research of Dr. Jeffrey M. Stryker of the Department of                         Chemistry at Indiana University.  The research will focus on                    developing new methods of carbon-carbon bond formation using                    transition metal organometallic compounds to synthesize                         derivatives of cyclobutane.  The project is expected to provide                 a deeper understanding of how such reactions occur as well as                   new organic synthetic methodology.",
