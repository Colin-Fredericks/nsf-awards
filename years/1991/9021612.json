 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells undergo dynamic changes during development as well as               after reaching maturity.  During development the establishment of               specific interconnected neural networks is accomplished, in part,               by the removal of extraneous or inappropriate connections                       (\"synapses\").  Similar structural changes in synapses                           (\"plasticity\") can also occur in the mature nervous system                      following appropriate environmental stimuli including those                     associated with learning and memory.  The research technique                    involves the use of a simple culture system of nerve cells                      isolated from the marine invertebrate, Aplysia.  Using this model               system one can examine whether common mechanisms are responsible                for synapse elimination during development and synapse plasticity               under conditions which simulate learning and memory in the adult.               One important advantage of this model system is that changes in                 the same set of connections can be compared during development                  and in the mature nervous system.  An understanding of these                    mechanisms may provide insight into process of development of the               nervous system and abnormalities which may occur in adults.",
