 "awd_abstract_narration": "One part of the study investigates the aerodynamic                         characteristics of the separated feathers that form slots at the                wing tips of birds that soar over land.  Theoretically, these                   feathers could reduce air resistance (drag).  Similar structures                (winglets) on the wing tips of some modern aircraft have this                   effect.  The study will measure how much the tip feathers reduce                drag in living birds and model bird wings in a wind tunnel.  The                results will answer a long-standing question about the role of                  the tip feathers in birds and will provide data that can be                     compared with measurements on aircraft winglets.                                     A second part of the study investigates the drag of wingless               birds in a wind tunnel.  Body drag must be known in order to                    evaluate theories for both gliding and flapping flight.  These                  theories explain how birds fly, and they are used to calculate                  food requirements during both daily foraging and long migratory                 flights.  The amount of food that an environment can supply is a                factor that must be considered in any plan to maintain or restore               bird populations.",
