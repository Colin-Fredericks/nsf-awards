 "awd_abstract_narration": "Isoprene emitted from trees is the largest source of hydrocarbons               in the atmosphere.  Isoprene decomposition in the atmosphere is                 rapid and causes lower atmosphere formation, acid rain, and blue                hazes.  Only some plants produce isoprene, it is a common trait in              trees ferns, and tropical plants.  The production of isoprene is                closely associated with the carbon photosynthesis,  but mechanism               of isoprene formation and its function in plants is unknown.  To                better understand isoprene emission and to predict changes in                   isoprene emission which may occur in the future the effect of                   growth conditions on isoprene synthesis will be studied.  The                   mechanism of isoprene synthesis will also be studied.                                                                                                           Previous results indicated that when oak trees are grown in high                carbon dioxide atmospheres the rate of isoprene emission can                    double.  In this project the effect of carbon dioxide will be                   further tested and the effect of increased temperature, believed                to be a consequence of increased carbon dioxide, will also be                   tested.  Rates of acclimation to the various growth conditions will             be assesed.                                                                                                                                                     The pathway of isoprene synthesis will be investigated using                    techniques developed to study photosynthesis.  Stable isotopes                  (nonradioactive) of carbon and hydrogen will be used to trace the               pathway of carbon during isoprene synthesis in leaves.                                                                                                          These studies are important because of the role of biogenic                     isoprene in atmospheric chemistry, because isoprene synthesis can               be a fast, nondestructive measure of important,  nonphotosynthetic              carbon metabolism inside chloroplasts (e.g. carotenoid synthesis),              because isoprene synthesis can affect the overall carbon budget of              plants.",
