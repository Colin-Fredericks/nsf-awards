They propose using a \"process model\" which is                       based on the experience of a pilot project involving a group                    of seven (7) chapters in forming such relationships.  That                      model is described in terms of three key elements and will                      entail the conduct of a series of workshops, offered to a                       progressively smaller number of invitees who have successfully                  negotiated the prior element, designed to shepherd at least 20                  local chapters through the final stages in the establishment                    of durable partnerships.  Foundation support is approximately                   10% of the total project cost which includes not only that of                   the immediate partnership but also that anticipated as a                        commitment by the local chapters of scientist time and                          materials.",
