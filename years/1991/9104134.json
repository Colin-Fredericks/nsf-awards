 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the research activities of three                   investigators in several areas of symbolic, smooth, and measurable              dynamics.  Among the topics in symbolic dynamics are automorphisms              of the shift, inverse problems for non-negative matrices, and                   general structural questions.  In smooth dynamics some of the                   topics are ergodicity and topological transitivity of partially                 hyperbolic dynamical systems, geodesic flows, and singular spaces               of non-positive curvature.  Among the topics to be studied in                   measurable dynamics are restricted orbit equivalence, non-singular              and rational joinings, and the construction of natural smooth                   models of measurable systems.                                                        This research group will study dynamical systems. The notion               of a dynamical system is a very general one.  The idea is just that             the system must evolve in time in some way.  The object is to learn             things of a general nature about the dynamics in the hope of                    classifying large families of these systems.  The dynamical systems             under consideration often behave chaotically over large time                    periods even when they are completely predictable.  To understand               how nevertheless to extract knowledge in this case is one of the                most important problems facing science today.  This is one of the               ultimate goals in the study of dynamical systems.",
