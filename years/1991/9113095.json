 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data quality is an extremely important problem,                           especially for regularly administered instruments such as the                   Current Population Survey (CPS),  which acquire a life of                       their own that resists major methodological innovations.                        This study implements a framework for resolving                                 inconsistencies in the unemployment duration data from a four                   month panel of the CPS.  The inconsistency problem that is                      referred to is that the change in the number of weeks of                        reported unemployment does not equal the time between surveys                   in some data records,  nor does the reported data clearly                       indicate that one unemployment spell has ended and another                      one has begun.  In many records,  there is insufficient                         information to resolve ambiguities about the exact sequence                     of labor force states,  and the true duration of                                unemployment.  The method proposed for cleaning up                              unemployment duration data from the monthly CPS panels is                       probabilistic.                                                                        For each data record containing ambiguities about the                     true labor force state and true duration of unemployment,  a                    joint probability distribution is formulated over possible                      consistent sequences of labor force states and true                             durations.  Then using Monte Carlo sampling,  consistent                        sequences are sampled and used as inputs into a model                           describing unemployment durations in a population.  Repeated                    sampling of consistent sequences for each record yields                         different estimates of the population distribution,  and                        allows a measure of information loss due to inconsistencies                     in the data to be calculated.                                                         A proportional hazards Markov chain model which allows                    for the inclusion of covariates parametrically,  and for                        analysis of duration dependence nonparametrically is                            developed.  This model is well suited to examine short,  data                   rich CPS panels,  and can provide a dynamic picture of                          changes in unemployment spell lengths of members of various                     labor force groups in response to seasonal or other changes                     in the economic climate.                                                              Two empirical studies are planned.  One will use the 4-                   8-4 sampling scheme of the CPS to estimate the effects of                       occurrence dependence on the length of unemployment spells.                     The second will use data from the CPS for all 12 months in                      1981 to examine how labor market prospects of various groups                    are affected by the onset of a recession.                                             This is a very promising proposal by a young researcher                   on an important topic.  If successful the study could have a                    major effect on data analysis using the CPS,  with possible                     extensions of the approach to the Panel Study on Income                         Dynamics (PSID) and other panel data bases that confront                        similar problems of inconsistencies.",
