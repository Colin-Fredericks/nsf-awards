 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of               the Chemistry Division, theoretical and experimental studies of                 small clusters will be made in order to derive potential energy                 parameters which might form the basis for functional group                      transferable intermolecular potentials.  One of the main                        objectives of this study is to develop a quantitative                           understanding of hydrogen bonding.  Quantum and semiclassical                   simulation methods will be used to predict cluster spectra and                  determine accurate potential energy surfaces for several organic                molecules.  High resolution infrared spectra of clusters formed                 from these molecules will be measured using laser-molecular beam                techniques.  The experimental and theoretical results will be                   combined to develop group-transferable potential energy surfaces                that can be used in studies of energy relaxation and in molecular               modelling codes.                                                                %%%                                                                             One of the most fluorishing areas in physical chemistry is the                  study of the formation, structure, and dynamics of clusters in                  small molecular systems.  Such species are important in                         atmospheric and combustion chemistry and their properties can more              easily be calculated with present theories.  The proposed studies               will provide data which can be compared with existing theories to               test their validity and to stimulate more sophisticated models.                 These models will ultimately lead to a detailed understanding of                environmentally and biologically significant systems.",
