 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal deals with a novel class of transposons                  capable of intracellular as well as intercellular transposition.                Besides being causative agents for the horizontal spread of                     multiple antibiotic resistance among clinical streptococci, this                group of genetic elements has been shown to transfer from Gram                  positive to Gram negative bacteria.  Thus, an investigation of the              properties of these is of biological interest, and of medical                   relevance.  Experimental observations seem to indicate that the                 larger conjugative transposons such as omegaBM6001 and omegaBM4200              are made of smaller discrete units at least one of which is capable             of independent movement when removed from its original context.                 The objectives of the proposed study are to distinguish between and             to isolate the component units, and to identify the transfer                    related regions.  Recent experiments demonstrating the retention                of conjugal properties of the BM6001 element subsequent to the in               vivo deletion of a Tn916 like element from within it strongly                   suggest the existence of a separate class class of mobile elements              whose properties could be distinct from those of the Tn916 class                of elements.  Mutant donor strains would be created to define the               transfer-- related regions within the omegaBM6001 devoid of the tet             element.  The details of the preferred target sites for the                     omegaBM6001 and the omegaBM4200 elements would be obtained by                   dideoxy DNA sequencing.  The role of the termini and the preferred              target site of the BM6001 element in conjugal transfer would be                 tested following construction of mutant strains carrying in vivo                induced deletions of these regions and using them in filter-mating              experiments.  Besides characterizing the structural and functional              details of this novel class of transposable DNA segments, the                   proposed investigation could enlarge our understanding of the                   origin and autoaccumulation of heterologous elements some of which              include antibiotic resistance determinants.",
