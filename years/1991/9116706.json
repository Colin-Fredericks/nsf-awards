 "awd_abstract_narration": "A crucial need for researchers in the area of science and                       technology studies is access to the works of scientists and                     engineers.  Traditionally, this has required travel to the archives             where the papers and other materials are kept.  In a few special                circumstances, the works have been published in scholarly editions.             Yet for certain purposes, even published papers are not sufficient              for the kinds of studies that researchers wish to undertake.  A new             technology, CD-ROM, allows easy reproduction of the original                    sources as well as computer searches of texts.  Under this grant,               Dr. Renn is seeking to establish an international collaboration in              order to enhance the accessibility of some of the major collections             in the history of science such as the Galileo collection in                     Florence and the Einstein Archive in Jerusalem.                                                                                                                 In order to be able to assess the existing technical possibilities              for realizing this project, this grant provides support for an                  exploratory study over 8 months of various approaches to putting                the Galileo and Einstein papers on CD-ROM.  At the completion of                this feasibility study, a meeting will be held in Italy to discuss              future directions for the use of CD-ROM technology in the history               of science and technology.",
