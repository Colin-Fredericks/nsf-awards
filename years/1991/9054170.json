During the                three week workshop selected fundamental topics from differential               equations will be discussed and it will be shown how these topics               can be useful in contemporary mathematical modeling problems,                   particularly problems in population dynamics including those                    factors which lead to the extinction or survival of endangered                  species. The emphasis will be on basic new theoretical results                  and their uses as well as mathematical modeling techniques.                     Participants will submit reports indicating how these ideas were                incorporated into, or affected, their courses or their research                 during the following year and reports will be distributed to all                participants.",
