These programs support individual                       visits by postdoctoral scientists and engineers of the                          participating countries to scientific research facilities                       of the other countries for familiarization, lecturing,                          and research.  The programs also include special thrusts                        to encourage the participation of young participants and                        to promote short-term project development visits in                             support of the NSF's cooperative research programs with                         the countries of the region.                                                                                                                                    This activity promotes two important program objectives:                        advancing scientific knowledge by fostering professional                        contacts between American and foreign scientists, and                           supporting U.S. foreign-policy objectives by maintaining                        a framework of nongovernmental cooperation with the                             U.S.S.R. and the countries of Eastern Europe.  The                              interacademy exchange programs have had an excellent                            record over the years of obtaining access for U.S.                              scientist and engineers to scientific personnel and                             facilities of these countries in a framework of                                 reciprocity and mutuality of benefit.",
