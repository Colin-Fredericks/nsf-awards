 "awd_abstract_narration": "The requested video equipment, lap-top computers, and software                  will improve the curriculum of the Department of Psychology.                    Last year the psychology department developed a computer                        laboratory facility that exposes introductory level students to                 quantitative methods used in psychological research.  Building                  upon this foundation, the department will develop a                             comprehensive student research facility and incorporate student                 research projects into the majority of it's core courses.  The                  research equipment requested in this proposal will allow                        undergraduate (both major and non-major) students to receive                    experience conducting psychological research.  Each research                    project is based on a published study, and is designed to                       coincide with lecture material.  The research projects will                     highlight important empirical methods used within the area of                   the core course.  Because of the designs of these projects,                     many of which will be conducted in field settings, the                          equipment must be flexible, portable, and capable of capturing                  a range of complex human behaviors.  For these reasons the                      department believes the requested video camera/editing system,                  lap-top computers and software is the most pedagogically                        effective means of meeting the department's needs.",
