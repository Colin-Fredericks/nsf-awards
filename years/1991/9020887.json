 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis                        (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, is an international institution                  that, according to its charter, conducts pure and applied                       research in systems analysis, \"in relation to problems of                       modern societies arising from scientific and technological                      development.\"  The institute is governed by a council                           comprised of representatives from 15 National Member                            Organizations, including the United States, the Soviet Union,                   Canada, Japan, and several Western and Eastern European                         countries.  In December 1989, the President determined that                     IIASA conducts useful research and merits U.S. support.                         Currently, its major research is focused in four policy                         relevant areas:  (1) the Envirnomental and Climate and                          Ecology-Related Program; (2) Population Program; (3)                            Technology, Economy and Society Program; and (4) System and                     Decision Science Program.  This grant will support research                     in all four areas.  Many of the specific issues addressed by                    IIASA's research, particularly in the first of these broad                      program areas, is closely related to Global Climate Change                      problems.  In view of its long-standing ties with scientists                    in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, IIASA is in a                           particularly good position to explore environmentally-related                   problems in that region of Europe, including their likely long-                 term conseqences for Western Europe.",
