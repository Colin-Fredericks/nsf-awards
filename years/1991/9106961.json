 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Fleming Crim is supported by a grant from the                      Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to observe bimolecular                  reactions of highly vibrationally excited polyatomic molecules                  and to exploit the special nature of these states to directly                   control the course of chemical reactions. The object is to                      develop and test out schemes to control bond breaking in larger                 molecules and to make fully quantum-state-resolved measurements                 which can be compared with theoretical dynamical calculations.                  The essence of the technique is to excite an isolated vibration                 in a polyatomic molecule and to turn that vibration into a                      reaction coordinate by a collision with a reactive atom such as                 H or O.  Reactions to be studied involve HCN, acetylene,                        ammonia, methane, propane, and methanol, using techniques such                  as stimulated emission pumping and laser-induced-fluorescence                   at vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths.                                              %%%                                                                             In this research the course of a chemical reaction between a                    polyatomic molecule and an atom is directly controlled by                       making use of vibrational excitation, based on the fact that                    the geometry change that occurs in going from reactants to                      products requires the stretching and breaking of bonds.                         Reactions involving collisions of energized molecules are                       central in atmospheric chemistry, combustion, and plasmas.",
