 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important area of sociolegal research is the study of the ways               in which law and culture interact in structuring how people make                sense of their world.  While cultural systems constantly change and             affect legal systems as well as the everyday assumptions of people              who deal with them, opportunities are rare to study the nature and              sources of change and whether these changes reflect indigenous                  influences or more global developments.  This study of Islamic law              aims to make such a contribution.                                                                                                                               The project itself will be centered on the legal and social system              of Morocco where Islamic law is distinctive for the judge's                     reliance on a set of common sense cultural assumptions.  The                    research design calls for examining data on Islamic law collected               in the 1960's in comparison to contemporary data.  It is                        hypothesized that common sense cultural conceptions of causation,               probability, and intent are manifested in legal interactions where              there is a necessity to manipulate and debate these terms                       explicitly.  Thus, by studying legal proceedings and conversations              about such proceedings, it will be possible to detect gradual                   transformations in the culture as a whole as well as in the nature              of law in Moroccan society.  Intensive interviews, courtroom                    observation, and conversational analysis will be used to consider               how conceptual changes are developing and how indigenous                        alterations affect social relations, assessment of land tenure                  disputes, and modes of characterizing other person's states of                  mind.                                                                                                                                                           This study, by comparing discourse and action across time, provides             a unique opportunity for exploration of the roots of sociocultural              change and the impact of the conceptual changes on legal systems.               The research also promises to have important implications not only              for understanding the changes which have occurred in the societies              of North Africa in recent decades and but also for what is occuring             now.  As such, the project will contribute to basic knowledge and               theories in both law and social science and cultural anthropology.",
