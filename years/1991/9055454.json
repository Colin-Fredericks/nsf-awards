 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson National                          Fellowship Foundation, is an 18 month project to provide                        information and resources to 50 carefully selected,                             outstanding high school biology teachers from all regions of                    the country.  The subject content of the program is the                         study of the relationship of the human species to its global                    environment.                                                                                                                                                    The program begins with a four week summer institute held at                    Princeton University during the summer of 1991, staffed by a                    faculty of college and university scientists enlisted                           nationwide. Institute activities include presentation -                         discussion sessions, computer and computer modeling                             activities, as well as experiments and demonstrations that                      can be used in the high school classroom.  These activities                     culminate in the development of units that can be used to                       integrate the information into high school biology                              curricula.                                                                                                                                                      During the following academic year, the participants                            implement these activities in their own classrooms and                          conduct in-service and outreach sessions on these activities                    in their local areas. Teams of the very best participants                       conduct one-week workshops at sites throughout the country                      in succeeding summers, thus reaching less well-prepared                         teachers, who are the ultimate target of the program.                                                                                                           The National Science Foundation is a participant in a much                      larger program of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, so that NSF                    funds are being matched at a 6.75:1 ratio.",
