 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in behavioral                    neuroendocrinology between Dr. Allen I. Selverston, University                  of California at San Diego, and Dr. Dr. Allain Van Wormhoudt,                   Laboratory for Marine Biology, College of France, Concarnu,                     France.  The objective of the project is to purify, sequence                    and synthesize a crustacean CCK-like peptide from the spiny                     lobster Panulirus interruptus, and to determine its physio-                     logical activity on the gastric mill network in the stomato-                    gastric ganglion.                                                                                                                                               This peptide has profound modulatory effects on a simple                        neural circuit, the gastric mill circuit of crustaceans, and                    is involved in the feeding- induced activation of the gastric                   mill.  Obtaining a sequence from this peptide will allow the                    investigators to study in detail the mechanisms by which a                      neuropeptide activates and modulates a well understood neural                   circuit.  This project is of particular importance, since the                   lobster CCK-like peptide is the first peptide modulating the                    stomatogastric rhythms, whose patterns of release in the                        lobster have been shown.  The stomatogastric system has been                    for many years one of the most important and instructive                        model systems available for studying both the control of                        rhythmic patterns and its modulation by various neurotrans-                     mitters. This project will take advantage of the known                          information to enhance our understanding of these modulatory                    processes.  The project will benefit from the mutual expertise                  of the two investigators:  Dr. Selverston is a leader in the                    field of small systems neurobiology and Dr. Von Wormhoudt is                    an experienced biochemist who has studied CCK in other                          crustacea.",
