 "awd_abstract_narration": "The atmospheric sulfur cycle has been a subject of intense                 interest to environmental scientists for many years because of                  the need to assess the contributions of biogenic and                            anthropogenic sulfur to such problems as acid rain, visibility                  reduction, and climate modification.  In heavily industrialized                 regions such as the eastern United States and much of Europe,                   anthropogenic sulfur emissions exceed natural emissions by about                an order of magnitude.  On a global scale, however, biogenic                    sulfur emissions are thought to approximately equal those from                  anthropogenic sources.  An understanding of the biogenic sulfur                 cycle is thus required in order to establish a baseline against                 which anthropogenic perturbations can be compared.                                                                                                                   This research program is three years in duration and                       involves continued laboratory studies aimed at elucidating the                  kinetics and reaction mechanisms which control the atmospheric                  oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds.  Direct observation of                   reactive intermediates and relatively stable products in \"real                  time\" is emphasized because only through such observations can                  results with a unique interpretation be obtained.  The                          experimental methods to be employed involve coupling laser flash                photolysis production of unstable reactions with time-resolved                  detection of intermediates and end products by laser induced                    fluorescence, atomic resonance fluorescence, long path UV-visible               absorption, or tunable diode laser (infrared) absorption.                       Whenever possible, experiments will be carried out under                        atmospheric conditions of temperature, pressure, and gas                        composition.",
