 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite rapid increases in the participation of women in the U.S.          labor force and efforts to eliminate gender-related discrimination in           employment, a large percentage of women remain mired in certain lower-          paying occupations.  Analyses of gender-related occupational                    segregation have focused on various institutional, social, and                  demographic factors.  Geographers have undertaken complementary                 analyses of geographic dimensions of employment patterns and processes,         focusing on the degree to which limited accessibility to transportation         and the location of job opportunities have restricted women's                   employment.  This award supports continuation of a project that                 examines the geographic, sociological, and personal dimensions of               employment for both men and women in different occupational categories          in Worcester, Massachusetts.  Data at the core of this analysis are the         detailed job and residential histories of workers in 620 households.            The location and occupational status of jobs held by these workers will         be analyzed to determine the nature and rate of job transitions and             reasons given for those changes.  A second part of the project will use         regression models to analyze the nature of individual employment in             terms of individual attributes like age and educational levels,                 household attributes like marital status and numbers and ages of                children, and spatial attributes like the locations of housing and              work sites and the locations of alternative jobs within reasonable              proximity to homesites.  Data included in this part of the analysis             also will be used to test hypotheses about the impacts of housing               relocations on employment and about ways that the geography of                  employment opportunities affects residential relocations.  As a final           part of this project, the investigators will investigate occupational           mobility as a social process explicitly set in specific places.  The            degrees to which personal contacts and information gathered at both             home and work sites affect employment searches will be explicitly               addressed in order to explore the geography of employment-information           networks.                                                                            This project will build on earlier studies by analyzing the                interplay of personal, social, and geographic factors in individual             employment and residential decision making.  Special attention will             focus on the different ways that women and men make decisions about the         nature and location of their jobs, thereby contributing to the broader          literature on gender-related patterns of employment.",
