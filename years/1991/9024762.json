 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for Professor Wimal Suaris                  of the University of Miami to collaborate during a long term                    visit with  Professor Jan G. M. van Mier of the Faculty of                      Civil Engineering of Delft University of Technology, The                        Netherlands.  These investigators share an interest in mixed-                   mode crack propagation of concrete.  They will conduct shear                    fracture tests on concrete, with acoustic emission monitoring,                  using the biaxial test rig available at the Dutch University.                   The Dutch group offers world class laboratory facilities that                   place it at the forefront of experimental civil engineering                     research.  They have developed the mixed-mode loading technique                 that is crucial for the proposed research.  Its use will be                     combined with a novel acoustic monitoring technique currently                   being developed by Professor Suaris.  He has a strong analytical                background and experience in non-destructive testing technology.                These complementary skills and their mutual interest in the                     fracture of concrete should result in a very fruitful collabo-                  ration.                                                                                                                                                         The failure of concrete structures involves a substantial                       amount of cracking.  It is natural to use a fracture mechanics                  approach to characterize the behavior of concrete.  However, it                 is generally accepted today that classical fracture mechanics,                  which was developed for homogeneous purely brittle materials,                   is inapplicable for concrete.  This is because a relatively                     large fracture process zone develops which undergoes softening                  damage.  Therefore, during the last decade, substantial                         research has been conducted on developing a form of fracture                    mechanics applicable for concrete.  The proposed collaboration                  will contribute to that effort and lead to improved understanding               of the behavior of concrete under stress.",
