 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental heterogeneity may influence the amount of additive                genetic variance in traits relevant to performance in a novel                   environment.  This can affect the potential of a population with                a given history to track environmental change and to adapt to a                 new environment.  The proposed experiments will measure the                     effect of environmental heterogeneity on traits under selection                 by the feature of the environment that is being varied.                                                                                                         Liriomyza trifolii, a dipteran leafminer, will be used as a model               system in this three phase program.  In phase 1, a genetically                  variable base population of L. trifolii will be established.  In                phase 2, replicate subpopulations of the base population will be                subjected to either uniform or heterogeneous host plant                         conditions for 20 generations.  Then the genetic variances and                  covariances in each replicate subpopulation for characters                      related to fitness on a novel plant will be measured.  In phase                 3, replicate selection lines from each treatment subpopulation                  will be initiated on the novel plant.  Responses to selection on                the novel plant will be measured for all lines and compared among               the environmental heterogeneity treatments in order to test the                 effects of population history on evolutionary dynamics.  After 10               generations of natural selection on the novel plant, genetic                    variances and covariances in fitness components will be re-                     measured.  Net selection imposed by the novel plant on these                    populations during the selection period will be calculated.                     Qualitative predictions about the evolutionary dynamics of                      populations with different histories of environmental                           heterogeneity when faced with a new environment will be tested.",
