Restriction enzyme                    analysis of mtDNA will be used to distinguish between these                     effects.  First, phylogeny of the genus will be compared with                   biogeography and physical history.  Second, maternal inheritance                patterns of mtDNA will be used to identify genotypes on recently                emerged islands and determine whether these genotypes evolved in                situ or represent dispersal events.  This will provide a lower                  estimate of colonization rate.  Third, maternal inheritance                     patterns of mtDNA will again be exploited to reconstruct the                    colonization history of the granitic Seychelles by P. sundbergi                 and P. astriata.  This information will be used to determine the                influences founder effects and ecological interactions have had                 in producing observed body size patterns.  Preliminary results                  indicate that the Seychelles were originally \"colonized\" by two                 distantly related ancestors. The colonist leading to P. astriata                was a close relative to P. lineata; the colonist leading to P.                  sundbergi was close relative to P. madagascariensis and P.                      abbotti.  Further work will include basic ecological studies,                   ecological comparisons with Anolis radiation, and phylogenetic                  comparisons with other taxa.",
