 "awd_abstract_narration": "In seismic design of reinforced concrete                                        structures using shear walls L-shaped or T-                                     shaped walls are often used.  The lateral                                       load behavior of these unsymmetrical \"flanged                                   walls\" is not well understood.  No                                              experimental studies have been conducted on                                     unsymmetrical flanged walls with aspect                                         ratios greater than two, and no                                                 recommendations exist to provide guidance on                                    appropriate analysis or design procedures.                                                                                                                      This project involves both analytical and                                       experimental studies of unsymmetrical flanged                                   shear walls.  Detailed analytical studies                                       will be conducted on two shear wall dominant                                    buildings in the San Francisco Bay Area with                                    instrumented response data recorded from the                                    1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and its                                             aftershocks.  The analytical studies are                                        designed to investigate modeling techniques                                     for lateral load response by comparing                                          measured and computed responses.  The                                           experimental studies will involve the design,                                   construction, and testing of four specimens                                     with different flanged widths and reinforcing                                   ratios.  The specimens will be subjected to                                     reversed cyclic lateral loading and constant                                    axial stress to investigate stiffness,                                          strength, and deformation characteristics of                                    the walls.  Detailed analytical studies using                                   nonlinear finite element techniques will be                                     used to evaluate existing analytical models                                     and to develop new analytical models.                                           The objectives of the combined analytical and                                   experimental studies will be to establish                                       guidelines for analytical modeling,                                             proportioning, and detailing of unsymmetrical                                   flanged shear walls for earthquake                                              resistance.",
