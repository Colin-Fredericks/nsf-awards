 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the travel costs of twelve U.S. scientists                  to participate in a U.S.-German seminar on advanced ceramics to                 be held near Munich, Germany, in November, 1990.  German                        sources are financing all costs of the meeting and the                          subsistence of the 30 to 40 experts expected to attend.  The                    meeting is co-organized by Professor Lisa C. Klein of Rutgers                   University and Drs. Richard Brook and Ralf Riedel of the Max                    Planck Institute for Metals Research in Stuttgart.  They are                    well known and widely-respected in this field.  The purposes of                 the workshop are to discuss the state-of-the-art in powder free                 processing for advanced ceramics, to identify important                         research directions for the future and to promote opportunities                 for productive international cooperation.  Specific themes                      shaping the discussions are 1) the sol-gel route for the                        preparation of monolithic oxide ceramics and glasses; 2) polymer                pyrolysis for the preparation of monolithic non-oxide ceramics;                 and 3) the direct metal oxidation (dimox) process and biological                methods for the formation of ceramics.                                                                                                                          Great efforts have been made in recent years to reach the                       levels of structural reliability which would allow ceramics to                  be used with confidence in a wide range of applications.  Much                  of the work has been concerned with improving powder-based                      methods that would reduce the occurrence of microscopic faults                  and flaws within the materials.  Although there has been great                  progress in powder processing science in recent years, the risk                 of flaws with powder systems remains considerable.  This                        meeting has the timely and worthwhile objective of examining                    alternative processing methods that would allow the fabrication                 of ceramics without the use of powders.  The U.S. and European                  participants are leaders in this field and represent both                       established and younger scientists.  The topics selected as                     foci will ensure significant interactions in forefront areas.",
