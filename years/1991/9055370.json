 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project sponsored by the George Washington University             is designed to enhance the content knowledge and teaching skills of             middle school science educators, to create a model for the innovative           use of computer aided, hypermedia technology in the science                     classrooms and to encourage increased collaboration between education           and scientists.  The first year will focus on life sciences and the             second year will focus on the physical sciences both as appropriate             for the middle school curriculum.  Each year fourteen teams from                schools in the greater Washington, D.C. area will participate in a              four week summer workshop with school year follow up sessions and               site visits.  The summer workshops consist of content enhancement,              skill building in the use of computer aided hypermedia and skill and            content utilization through the development of classroom lessons and            leadership skills development.  The school year follow up includes              team meetings, implementation of science lessons, site visits,                  Saturday sessions, inservice workshops lead by participants and                 participation in a regional science educators conference.",
