 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research between Stanley Zionts and Vahid                    Lotfi, State University of New York at Buffalo, and Yang                        Deli, Dalian University of Technology, People's Republic of                     China, aims to develop and evaluate a decision support system                   to be used to support joint venture negotiations.  This                         research will draw from three areas of inquiry:  international                  management, information systems, and multiple criteria                          decision making.  Existing joint ventures will be analyzed,                     and in the final stages of research, the group decision                         support system will be tested in ongoing joint ventures                         negotiations.                                                                                                                                                   This collaboration draws on a well established relationship                     between the participating institutions, access to excellent                     facilities at each location, and a unique opportunity to work                   with joint ventures in China.  In addition to contributing to                   an enhanced understanding of decision support system technology                 and its application in multi-cultured negotiations, it is                       anticipated that results of this research will be valuable to                   joint venture negotiation.",
