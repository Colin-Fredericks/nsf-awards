 "awd_abstract_narration": "Institutional and national studies have reported a                         diminishing proportion of underrepresented minority college                     students entering and completing technical mathematics-based                    degree programs during the past two decades.  Research by                       Uri Treisman has shown that an interactive workshop model                       based on academic excellence rather than remediation greatly                    enhances the success for many of these students in first-                       year calculus.                                                                                                                                                       The present study examines the paths of workshop                           students throughout the course of their academic program,                       and the effect that the workshop experience may have had.                       This effect is measured in two complementary ways.  First,                      by the short term and longitudinal institutional data on the                    academic success of these students within their technical                       major, and second, by the impact that the workshop                              experience had on the student's academic career as defined                      and interpreted by the individual student.  Primary data                        will be collected at the California Polytechnic State                           University at Pomona.  Results will be considered within the                    context of comparative workshop data from other institutions                    nationally, including the City University of New York and                       the University of Illinois.  Conclusions and recommendations                    will be discussed as they relate to current and future                          interactive mathematics programs.",
