 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis of RNA (transcription) is a process common to                     all organisms, and is catalyzed by the enzyme RNA                               polymerase.  It is a central step in the flow of information                    from the DNA to cellular structure and function and is                          subject to considerable regulation.  The transcription                          process can be divided into two types of activities.  The                       first includes those steps which are common to all RNA                          polymerases: the synthesis of RNA by polymerization of                          nucleotides in the template - directed reaction.  The second                    includes the regulatory processes which modulate                                transcription and differ in complexity and mechanism among                      organisms.  The proposed experiments are designed to analyze                    these activities at the molecular level by employing                            photochemical crosslinking.  The bacterium Escherichia coli                     will be used as a model for these studies.  The in vitro                        transcription system employing purified E. coli RNA                             polymerase has been well characterized, and many                                transcriptional regulatory factors have been identified.  By                    incorporating nucleotide analogs which are tagged with                          photoreactive crosslinking groups into the RNA during                           transcription, it is possible to probe the molecular                            environment of the RNA during its synthesis.  RNA containing                    such analogs becomes covalently attached to adjacent                            molecules upon irradiation with ultraviolet light .  RNA                        will be synthesized in vito which contains photocrosslinking                    groups at different positions within the RNA, and the                           contacts made between these groups and the RNA polymerase                       subunits and/or DNA template will be analyzed.  The                             immediate goal of this work is to use photocrosslinking                         nucleotide analogs to identify the RNA polymerase domains                       involved in substrate and product binding, as well as the                       regions containing the catalytic activities for                                 phosphodiester bond formation and RNA displacement from the                     DNA-RNA hybrid.  These experiments should provide                               information about the fundamental mechanisms of RNA                             synthesis common to all RNA polymerases.  The question                          conformational differences among transcription complexed                        from differentially regulated promoters (antiterminated,                        stringently controlled, etc.).  The long range goal is to                       structurally characterize the E.coli transcription complex,                     understand the mechanism of RNA synthesis at the molecular                      level, and analyze the effects of regulatory factors such as                    NusA of ppGpp on RNA polymerase conformation and activity.",
