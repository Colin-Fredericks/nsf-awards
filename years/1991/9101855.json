 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career Advancement project will focus on a relatively new                  area of research for Dr. Catherine McNeal.  Preliminary studies                 have established that Californium-252-plasma desorption mass                    spectrometry (Cf-252 PDMS)is a valuable experimental method to                  characterize large metal clusters.  A variety of large anionic                  platinum carbonyl clusters and cationic gold and mixed metal                    gold and gold supraclusters have been investigated by this                      experimental approach.  This project will focus on the                          development of Cf-252 PDMS as a reliable and accurate method to                 characterize large metal clusters and to use this approach to                   unambiguously characterize intermediates and products in novel                  inorganic syntheses.  The first step will be to prove that the                  Cf-252 PDMS spectrum is an accurate representation of solution                  and sample composition for a variety of clusters.  Oligomers                    containing as many as 20 units and over 500 platinum atoms have                 been detected, and the origin of such clusters will be                          determined.  These clusters exhibit redox behaviour on exposure                 to silica.  Cf-252 PDMS will be used to determine whether these                 processes involve changes in cluster nuclearity or cluster                      charge.  An understanding of fragmentation patterns is                          essential in order to distinguisn fragment ions from sample                     components.  This project will provide an unambiguous                           measurement of the stoichiometry of large supraclusters from                    studies on smaller clusters of known composition and structure.                 %%%                                                                             This Career Advancement Award will support activities that will                 enhance Dr. Catherine McNeal's research career potential.  New                  skills which are crucial to the change in direction of her                      research activities will be developed.  Furthermore, this                       project is strongly interactive with the research of other                      investigators who will benefit from the results as well.",
