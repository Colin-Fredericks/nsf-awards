 "awd_abstract_narration": "Could condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration exerts a                     profound influence on the earth's atmosphere by directly                        affecting cloud albedo.  As a first step toward developing the                  needed parameterization of cloud microphysics for global                        questions such as the effect of marine aerosol or air pollution                 on cloud albedo, it is essential to test the internal consistency               which must exist between aerosol microphysics, nucleation theory,               and direct measurements of CCN concentrations.  The objective of                this planning grant is to develop the protocol for such a test.                 The planning period will be used to investigate and evaluate such               topics as:  experimental verification of the relationship                       between size, composition, and CCN concentration for particles                  containing mixtures of insoluble material, soluble salts, and                   organic compounds; measurement of droplet growth rates in                       supersaturated environments, including the effects of organic                   films; comparisons between nuclei activated in CCN counters and                 nuclei which have been activated in real clouds.  Sensitivities                 required in the measurements will be modelled and compared with                 typical instrumental accuracies.",
