 "awd_abstract_narration": "Swimming is a key factor in energy acquisition, energy                          expenditure, and survival of fishes.  The ability to efficiently                obtain food while avoiding becoming food for predators is                       strongly affected by the presence of structures such as rocks,                  weeds, windfall trees, corals, artifical reefs etc.  These                      structures are especially important in streams, oceanic currents,               and tidal flows.  The ability  of fish to use structures depends                on morphology and behavior which vary among species.                            Consequently interactions with habitat structure affect                         population dynamics, community compostition and the evolutionary                biology.                                                                                                                                                        In spite of the importance of structure to so many apsects of the               lives of fishes, there has been little research on mechanisms                   employed.  Our research will be the first attempt to provide a                  common mechanistic understanding and predictive model for fish                  interactions with the complex structures they prefer.   We                      examine behavior and swimming performance as fish use complex                   structure, determining imposed current velocity and fish                        morphology.  We expect our results will help explain habitat                    preferences in relatively stable or predictable situations such                 as lower river reaches, many inland lakes, and offshore marine                  habitats.   We also believe our results will help explain how                   fish survive in or are excluded from more naturally stressful                   habitats, such a temperate streams and intertidal zones.                                                                                                        We believe our research will have impact on fisheries management.               Addition of structure is a common habitat improvement practice                  and field experience show that various stuctures can be used to                 attract different fish species.  Our results should provide a                   predictive basis for such habitat improvement practices.",
