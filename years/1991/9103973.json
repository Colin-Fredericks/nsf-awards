 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on interactions of phospholipases A1, A2,              and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C(PI-PLC) with                  lipid membrane systems.  These enzymes play key roles in the                    production of bioactive lipids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes,                   platelet activating factor), in signal transduction across                      membranes, and the release of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored             proteins from membranes.  Major points to be addressed are the                  mechanisms of action, substrate specificities, interactions with                lipid interfaces, and the nature of the activation by the lipid                 interface.  Kinetics will be studied using thiolester substrate                 analogs in continuous spectrophotometric assay systems with mixed-              micelles of detergent and substrate, with vesicles of anionic                   phospholipids, and in monolayer systems.  Protein-lipid                         interactions will be studied by fluorescence spectroscopy, and by               penetration of proteins into monolayers of non-hydrolyzable                     phospholipids.  The kinetics of recombinant PI-PLC from Bacillus                cereus will be studied in micellar systems using a continuous                   spectrophotometric assay with thiophosphate ester substrate                     analogs.  Minimal substrate requirements will be determined.  A                 comparison of phosphoinositide phosphotransferase (production of                inositol 1,2-cyclophosphate) and inositol 1,2-cyclophosphate                    phosphohydrolase (production of inositol-1phosphate) activities                 will be made.  Recombinant hepatic lipase (phospholipase A1) and                mutants (at the putative lipid-binding and active sites), and                   recombinant placental phospholipase A2 will also be studied. //",
