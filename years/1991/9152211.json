 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop an exciting, attractive                  environment for learning computer science through hands-on                      exploration and experimentation.  The curriculum aspect                         consists of a series of related but reasonably independent                      learning modules covering the introductory courses through data                 structures.  They are usable by a wide range of students, from                  high school to university.  The modules use graphics and                        visualization to provide direct exposure to the problems and                    processes which are important in computation, complementing                     what can be understood by logic with what can be learned by                     working with the hands and observing with the eyes.  The                        modules consist of manipulative materials, demonstration                        programs based on visual representations of important concepts,                 hypercard-based learning materials, source code, and teaching                   guides.  This project equips a classroom with enough computers                  so that students can work on line during the class.  Such a                     laboratory enables students to work with the materials in class                 as concepts are introduced, so that class time becomes a time                   for doing instead of just watching and listening.  It gives                     faculty a chance to evaluate student comprehension of new                       material as it is presented and to provide additional                           assistance where it is needed.  The experience in the classroom                 also introduces students to a style of active learning which                    they can carry over into other contexts.",
