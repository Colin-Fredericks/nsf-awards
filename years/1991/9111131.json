 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award is for a planning grant funded under the Minority                     Research Initiation Program.  The purpose of a planning grant is to             provide financial support for an investigator to prepare a                      competitive research proposal.  This planning grant will enable the             investigator to prepare a research proposal which focuses on                    analyzing the effects of mergers and buy outs on wages in various               industries.                                                                                                                                                     As a result of less restrictive antitrust policy, and increased                 deregulation, the frequency and size of mergers rose significantly              during the 1980's.  There is concern that employment relations will             be altered by this structural change in product markets.  Union                 leaders, for example, content that the wave of corporate mergers in             the 1980's disproportionately harmed union members.  Mergers                    occasionally resulted in the new corporation repudiating existing               unions or seeking major concessions.                                            This raises the possibility that one reason for mergers is to                   capture union rents.  This proposed research will attempt to                    explain the pattern of mergers using individual worker data.",
