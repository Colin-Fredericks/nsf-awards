 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this project is the further development and              elaboration of a multisectoral, intertemporal, nonlinear                        programming model to analyze the effects on the Indian economy of               restrictions on the emission of greenhouse gases.  This project                 will also advance a secondary objective of constructing prototype               models for other developing counties.  This study is motivated by               the presumption that the developing countries may become important              emitters of greenhouse gases and by the conviction that policy                  formation with respect to greenhouse gas emissions requires country             level analyses.  Unique features of this model include: the                     tracking of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, the                     formulation of the greenhouse gas restrictions in terms of their                total radiative forcing effect rather than in terms of current                  emissions rates, the identification of emissions that create                    ground-level air pollution, and allowance for retrofitting of                   capital equipment.  This research is important because it will                  provide a much needed framework for being able to begin analyzing               the economic and social consequences of greenhouse-gas abatement                on an international scale.",
