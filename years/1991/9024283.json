 "awd_abstract_narration": "The herpetological collection of the Field Museum of Natural               History contains 234,000 catalogued representatives of the                      world's amphibians and reptiles, including 1,226 types.  The                    collection is the fifth largest herpetology collection in the                   U.S., and the Museum administration has recently added                          significantly to that portion of the building assigned to the                   collection.  Dr. Harold Voris, Curator in charge of the                         collection, is planning additional storage equipment for this                   expansion project, including an ultra-cold freezer for the frozen               tissue collection.  New research areas will be constructed and                  equipped for visiting scientists, and data from the field note,                 frozen tissue, and histological slide collections will be added                 to the collection database.                                                          The proposed improvements to this important herpetology                    collection will increase its value to and impact on the research                community.  Improvements to the database will make specimens more               available for study and loan, and the new lab space for visiting                herpetologists will be heavily used.  Natural history collections               such as this are the primary resource for studying biological                   diversity on earth, and their continued improvement is essential                for future generations of researchers.",
