 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research program is a comprehensive experimental                   investigation of the dynamics of ultraviolet excimer laser ablation             of materials in plasma versus gas environments.  These will be the              first experiments to investigate laser ablation in pre-ionized                  plasma backgrounds over a wide range of fill gas pressure, from                 atmospheric to 1 mTorr.  The objective of this research is to                   develop a knowledge base on laser ablation processing in plasmas                versus gases which can be usef for engineering applications, such               as ablative etching of microelectronics, micromachining, ablative               material synthesis, and combustion.  Research will be performed on              two important cases concerning interaction of laser-ablated matter              (plasma, neutral atoms, and particulates) with 1) background                    plasmas versus gases which are nonreacting, and 2) plasmas versus               gases which can support oxidation, nitriding, or combustion.                    Species-resolved laser probing diagnostic measurements will be                  performed to characterize excimer laser ablation plume species                  dynamics.  Laser-ablation-assisted-discharge experiments will be                performed with applicability to rapid-heating, ablation and                     ionization of materials.  Complete experimental facilities exist                for this research, including:  excimer lasers (KrF and XeCl), dye               laser, CO2 laser, ruby lasers, and copper vapor laser, as well as               extensive spectroscopic facilities.                                                                                                                             The knowledge obtained in this research could lead to breakthroughs             in materials processing and synthesis techniques.  Any discoveries              will expand the technology base for fabrication in the micro-                   electronics, opto-electronics, manufacturing, and machine tool                  industries.",
