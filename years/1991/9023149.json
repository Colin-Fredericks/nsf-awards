 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop compounds as tools to                study opioid receptors.  These receptors are proteins which are                 responsible for both the beneficial and the undisirable effects                 of narcotic analgesics such as morphine.  However, not all opioid               receptors are identical and this has complicated the study of                   this receptor group.  Since the demonstration of these multiple                 opioid receptors about fifteen years ago, numerous compounds have               been prepared in attempts to differentiate the receptor types.                  To further complicate the issue, endogenous morphine-like                       substances have been isolated from animals.  These compounds,                   opioid peptides, are fragments of other proteins and appear to be               involved in a number of physiological functions including pain                  sensation.                                                                                                                                                      This research involves the preparation of derivatives of one of                 the opioid peptides, dynorphin.  This opioid interacts with                     kappa-opioid receptors which are distinct from morphine                         receptors.  The study of kappa opioid receptors may lead to the                 development of better nonaddictive analgesics.  The opioids are                 synthesized containing 'affinity labels' which cause the                        synthetic opioid to permanently bind to the receptor.  In this                  way, any neuroscientists or pharmacologist may use these new                    peptides to differentiate between the various types of opioid                   receptors.",
