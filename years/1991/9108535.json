 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support to the Office of International                  Affairs of the National Academy of Sciences for a two-day conference-           ,\"Emerging Issues in the International Protection of Intellectual               Property Rights\"  to be held January, 1992. A primary purpose of the            conference is to recast the current dialogue on international                   intellectual property rights (IPR) issues in terms of the role of               science and technology in promoting economic advance. The conference            will involve international paticipants, as well as U.S. academic,               industrial, and government representatives. Papers, commissioned from           distinguished national and international experts on IPR issues, will            provide the basis for discussion at the conference. An advisory                 committee composed of distinguished economists, lawyers, and                    representatives from U.S.industrial and academic organizations will             recommend topics for these papers, as well as qualified authors. The            proceedings of the conference will be published, along with the                 commissioned papers, and widely disseminated to U.S. policymakers,              the international community, and U.S. universities and industry.                These results will have direct implications for the IPR aspects of              the National Science Foundation's planning and management of                    international cooperative programs and for the NSF's role in assessing          the impact of IPR issues on the international exchange of science and           engineering knowledge.",
