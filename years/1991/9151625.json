 "awd_abstract_narration": "An introductory-level electro-mechanical motion devices and                     systems laboratory is being developed which has as its                          principal focus low-voltage devices, typical to low-power                       control system applications.  The primary purpose of the                        laboratory is to reinforce experimentally the concepts which                    are presented in a Junior-level course in electro-mechanical                    motion devices course, which has evolved over the last seven                    years as an elective.  Recently this course attained the                        position as one of the five basic courses of which all                          electrical engineering students must select three; all other                    courses of this stature have associated laboratories.  Also,                    this laboratory provides a modern setting for the student to                    select their required design project in the electro-mechanical                  systems area.  The requested equipment includes data                            acquisition systems which are interfaced with personal                          computers which will assist in the interpretation and analysis                  of the steady-state and dynamic characteristics of the electro-                 mechanical devices considered as well as provide computer                       simulation as a tool.",
