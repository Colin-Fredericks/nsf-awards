The course includes both lecture                 (three credit hours) and lab (two credit hours) sections for                    one semester.  It is being offered to university students at                    the freshman or sophomore level to fulfill natural science                      requirements.The recently upgraded Meteorology Lab in the                       Atmospheric Sciences Program at UNCA as supported by the                        National Science Foundation provides a high-tech environment                    for students to archive, manipulate, display, and present                       satellite/radar imagery and other weather information                           interactively.  Three specialized meteorological software                       packages (PC-McIDAS, The WXP, and UNAWIPS) allow students to                    fully visualize the development and movement of weather                         systems.Students have hands-on experience in lab sections and                   learn applications of microcomputers in meteorology.This                        multidisciplinary course maintains its integrity as meteorology                 and offers students practical training in mathematics and                       computer literacy.",
