 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing concern about recent population declines in                  forest breeding songbirds in North America.  The absence of many                of these species from small forest tracts has led to questions                  about the effects of forest fragmentation on songbird                           reproductive success.  Increased nest predation and brood                       parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds appear to be associated with                increased forest fragmentation.  There is, however, a paucity of                data on the impact of cowbird parasitism and nest predation on                  the reproductive success of individual species of forest-nesting                birds.  The purpose of this study is to examine the population                  dynamics of the wood thrush, a rapidly declining forest songbird.               The factors determining reproductive success on three study sites               in a moderately fragmented region, the Shawnee National Forest of               southern Illinois where cowbird parasitism and nest predation                   rates are high will be studied.  These data will be used to                     evaluate a model of population dynamics that proposes that some                 populations (sources) regularly produce surplus offspring which                 immigrate to other populations (sinks) which would otherwise                    become extinct as a result of low reproductive success.  This                   model will be evaluated at regional, local and temporal scales.",
