The primary interest is to                  study the effect of non-parallel channel walls on the two                       mechanisms for instability:  the mechanism associated with the                  presence of fluid-fluid interfaces and the mechanism associated                 with the presence of solid walls.  The baseline geometry to be                  studied is a two-dimensional channel consisting of two constant                 width sections joined by a converging section.  The stability of                steady isothermal flow of three layers of Newtonian fluids of                   different viscosities and densities will be examined using local                linear analysis, global linear analysis, and direct numerical                   simulation.  The direct numerical simulation will be based on time-             accurate integration of the spectrally discretized (spectral                    elements) full unsteady Navier-Stokes equation.  The study will be              extended to non-Newtonian fluids and will incorporate thermal                   effects.  The long term goal of the project is the development of               a reliable method for the (1) prediction of stability                           characteristics of coextrusion processes and (2) design testing,                and analysis of coextrusion dies.                                                    The research will lead to improved manufacturing process for               coextrusion of polymers.",
