 "awd_abstract_narration": "Articulation of biology education and reform of undergraduate                   programs for non-majors requires clarifying fundamental                         biological concepts, recognizing the unique characteristics of                  institutions, and considering the role and influence of pre-                    college education in the life sciences.  The Biological Science                 Curriculum Study (BSCS) proposes to complete a design study of                  biology education at pre-college and college levels.  The goals                 of the study are to elaborate the conceptual structure of                       biology and to determine appropriate curriculum frameworks for                  high school, community colleges, and undergraduate courses for                  non-majors.  The development of curriculum frameworks for                       collegiate courses for non-majors biology can provide                           substantial leadership for the biology education community.                     The concurrent development of high school programs based on a                   similar conceptual framework will help accomplish the objective                 of bridging the gap between precollege and undergraduate                        science.  Because the proposed undergraduate program includes                   two-year colleges large numbers of women and minority students                  will be served, groups that are currently underserved by                        science education.The eleven-month study will use experts to                    identify and clarify the major concepts of biology and                          recommend curriculum frameworks for pre-college and college                     programs.  The recommendations of this study will be published                  and disseminated to professional societies in biology and                       biology education for further distribution.",
