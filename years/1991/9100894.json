 "awd_abstract_narration": "A eight week program of mathematical research involving eight                   undergraduate students working with nine faculty members will be                                                                                                supported by this Research Experiences for Undergraduates award.                                                                                                The work will center on problems of matrix theory and discrete                  structures.  Participants will attack a progressive series of                   problems of increasing difficulty and generality.  Several will                 benefit from exploration using sophisticated mathematical                       software packages for symbolic and matrix calculations.                                                                                                         Typical problem areas include studies of isometries of G-                       invariant matrix norms, computer generation of generalized                      numerical ranges, unitary factors in polar decomposition and                    robust Lyapunov matrices.                                                                                                                                       Students will also visit research facilities at NASA (Langley                   Research Center), ICASE, VIMS, CEBAF and NIST where faculty                     advisors have established working relationships. Reports will be                                                                                                completed by each student at the end of the program.  Students                  will be encouraged to present results of their work at                          professional meetings during the following academic year.",
