 "awd_abstract_narration": "Receptors are proteins that are involved in the communication                   between nerve cells, playing an important role in cellular                      activity.  The goal of this research project is to study the                    muscarinic receptor, a receptor activated by the chemical release               of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which causes different                  effects in cells.  Initial studies will be performed to determine               which of the five subtypes of the muscarinic receptor alters                    cellular activity.  In order to accomplish this, Dr. Jones will                 develop probes, antibodies that are raised against each of the                  muscarinic receptor subtypes.  These probes will attach only to                 the receptor subtype against which the antibody was raised. It is               postulated that these antibodies will prevent the activation of                 the receptors.  By monitoring the activity induced by the                       receptors individually, the antibody can be added, and if the                   activity of the receptor is terminated the antibodies are thus                  considered useful probes.  Understanding the mechanisms by which                these receptors control cellular activity in nerve cells will aid               in the understanding of how the brain works.",
