 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is the lead project in an integrated research                 program into the oceanographic structure of the western Weddell                 Sea.  It is to be carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied                 by U.S. and USSR scientists from February to June 1992.  This                   project concerns the large-scale oceanographic circulation and                  the variability of the Weddell Sea boundary current, and how                    these affect and are affected by the regional water mass                        formation and modification processes.  The Weddell Sea may be                   divided into three regions on the basis of the energy exchange                  mode.  The warm regime occurs in the east where the intrusion of                warm circumpolar deep water keeps the water temperature nea +1                  deg C.  The cold regime occurs in the center, where deep water is               overlain by a thick near freezing mixed layer.  In both regions                 however enough heat is seasonally carried to the sea ice to melt                it completely.  In the western region, the sea ice cover does not               melt, and it is expected that the thermodynamics processes will                 be different.  Hydrographic data, coupled with the current meter                observations, chemical tracer experiments, turbulent flux                       measurements, and sea ice dynamics that are part of this project,               will provide a unique picture of the Weddell Sea continental                    slope processes.",
