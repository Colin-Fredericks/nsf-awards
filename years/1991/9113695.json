 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the dynamics of dense                            x-pinch and z-pinch plasmas produced by                                         submicrosecond pulsed power generators.  An x-                                  pinch consists of at least two fine wires stretched                             between output electrodes of a high power pulser                                such that they cross and touch in the form of an X.                             Powered by 400-500kA, 80ns current pulses, the                                  resulting plasma is a very intense, submillimeter                               source of soft x-rays (starting with metal wires) or                            neutrons (starting with deuterated polyethylene                                 fibers).  The objective of this study is to understand                          the dynamics of x-pinch plasmas so that possible                                applications (e.g., to microlithography, imaging of                             living cells and determining the spatial resolution of                          a neutron detector) can be intelligently evaluated.  To                         accomplish this effectively, a pulser designed                                  specifically to power the x-pinch will be built, and                            dense x-pinch plasmas (as well as the simpler z-                                pinches for comparison) will be studied with 1ns time                           and 0.1mm space resolution using optical and x-ray                              diagnostic techniques.  Soft x-ray measurements will                            be used to probe the dense core plasma, and                                     interferometry and Faraday rotation measurements                                will probe the surrounding region.  The purpose of                              these measurements is to determine the mass density                             and current density distributions as a function f time.                         From these quantities, the various phenomena                                    observed in x-pinch (and z-pinch) implosions can be                             understood.",
