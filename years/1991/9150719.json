 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project adds a laboratory component to a successful pilot                  program in mathematical and computer literacy, expands this                     program to large scale use, and evaluates this program.  The                    pilot program is an effort to find an appropriate place for                     mathematics and computer science within a core curriculum, a                    set of general education courses required of all students.  One                 goal of the program is to attract undecided students,                           particularly woman and minorities, to the fields of mathematics                 and computer science.  Another goal is to guarantee that those                  students who do not pursue a scientific career will be                          sufficiently sophisticated to make intelligent judgements about                 computer-related issues.  The approach used in the program is                   a principles-based one, but avoids attempting a broad survey of                 the field.  Instead, it uses a hands-on approach to focus on                    sentential logic, its relation to everyday reasoning and                        language, and its application to the design of digital                          circuits.  It also focuses on an extremely small subset of                      Pascal, chosen to teach the significance of iteration and the                   software engineering principle of solving complicated problems                  by combining solutions to simpler ones.The project involves the                 design, development, piloting and evaluation of a digital logic                 lab component to be added to the current course.  The project                   also supports five faculty development seminars for instructors                 both inside and outside of CUNY to disseminate the experience                   of the pilot program in order to encourage large scale use.  In                 addition, the project involves a broad assessment of the impact                 of the pilot program on students performance in more advanced                   classes.",
