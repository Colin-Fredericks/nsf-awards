 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate                                microencapsulated phase-change materials as heat-transfer                       media in gas-fluidized beds.  Microcapsules are small                           capsules, usually between 50 and 100 \u001am diameter, consisting                    of an impervious shell of only a few microns' thickness                         enclosing a gaseous, liquid, or solid core material.  Phase-                    change materials such as toluene, cyclohexane, or                               fluorocarbons are potential core material for these                             experiments.  Convection coefficients for these materials are                   expected to be much larger than those for gas-fluidized beds                    of solid particles.  Furthermore, pressure drops in such beds                   are expected to be small compared to conventional beds because                  of smaller densities for capsules compared to solid particles.                                                                                                  Our approach includes both experimental and theoretical                         evaluations.  An electrically heated probe is used to measure                   convection coefficients in temperature-controlled fluidized                     beds of microencapsulated phase-change material.  Several                       theories of heat transfer in fluidized beds will be tested                      against our experimental data.  Suitable theoretical                            refinements will be developed as appropriate for the                            microencapsulated phase-change materials.  The improvements in                  heat transfer will expand the opportunities for using                           fluidized beds in such diverse applications as air-cooled                       microelectronics equipment, where pressure drop is critical;                    gas-liquid heat exchangers, where gas-side heat transfer is                     rate limiting but difficult to enhance; and liquid fluidized                    beds, where heat capacities of conventional bed materials are                   not enough larger than the liquid heat capacity to yield the                    order-of-magnitude enhancements typical of gas-fluidized beds.",
