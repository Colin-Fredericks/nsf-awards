 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students Teaching Others Paleontology (STOP) is an eighth and ninth             grade science project initiated for girls to explore, to interpret and          to record the geological history along the U.S. Highway 45 corridor in          Northeast Mississippi.  The research fossil site is located                     approximately three miles from the Boonsville High School.                                                                                                      This exploratory activity is novel and timely and will result in                research experiences for students engaged in the fossil collections.            These particular scientific discoveries of sixty million year old               fossils will provide students with an enormous grasp of time space and          access to specialized data which will help them to verify and classify          the fossils.                                                                                                                                                    The site has been identified by geologists and geographers at                   Mississippi State University as unique.  The enlargement of U.S. Highway        through this area has made available exposures of Cretaceous and                Tertiary rocks that contain an impressive amount of fossil material.            The fossil material is well preserved and contain species rarely seen in        Mississippi or elsewhere.  It has been evaluated by the department at           Mississippi State University and deemed to be one of the more important         in this region.  A team of geologists from the University of Mississippi        and Mississippi State University will assist in removing and identifying        the fossils.  Scientists/Mentors from other agencies and universities           will serve as role models for the women and minorities which Project            STOP targets.                                                                                                                                                   The students' fossil collection will be preserved in their libraries and        at the geology museum at Mississippi State University.",
