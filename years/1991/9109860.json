The distinguishing                                            feature of neuromolecular networks                                              is that the input-output behavior of                                            the neuron-like modules is                                                      controlled by significant                                                       intraneuronal dynamics, including                                               macromolecular recognition mechanics                                            and transduction of input signals to                                            a form that can be recognized by                                                marcomolecules.  The working                                                    hypothesis is that significant                                                  biological information processes are                                            mediated by systems of this type;                                               moreover, the rapid development of                                              molecular electronics technologies                                              should in the future allow for bona                                             fide molecular implementations.  A                                              simulation system that can be used                                              for designing such systems and that                                             also has artificial intelligence                                                applicability in the context of                                                 existing silicon technologies has                                               been developed.  During the past                                                year an advanced evolutionary                                                   learning algorithm that utilizes a                                              memory manipulation capability to                                               assign credit to individual neurons                                             in a network has been also been                                                 developed.  Credit apportionment is                                             based on input control and reward                                               sharing in a population of virtual                                              networks.  The algorithm has been                                               tuned on connectionist neural                                                   networks and has been tested                                                    successfully on neuromolecular                                                  networks with relatively simple                                                 intraneuronal dynamics.  Cellular                                               automaton dynamics will be used to                                              represent signal processing in the                                              cytoskeleton, and the credit                                                    apportionment algorithm will be used                                            to train networks of \"cytoskeletal                                              neurons\".  A key objective is to                                                build \" evolution friendliness\" into                                            the intraneuronal and network                                                   dynamics on which evolutionary                                                  algorithms act by simulating the                                                type of structure-function relations                                            that enable natural biological                                                  systems to learn efficiently through                                            evolution.  High dimensionality is                                              critical since it increases the                                                 likelihood of finding easily                                                    traversible pathways between                                                    functionally useful systems.  The                                               study will focus on the effects of                                              increasing the intraneuronal                                                    cellular automaton dynamics in                                                  neuromolecular networks and memory-                                             manipulation algorithms capable of                                              orchestrating special purpose                                                   cytoskeletal neurons into coherent                                              groups capable of performing complex                                            pattern recognition/effector control                                            tasks.",
