 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1988 University of Georgia mathematics faculty members                    have conducted special calculus workshops to support students                   from traditionally under-represented groups (minorities and                     women) who aspire to scientific and technical careers. 'These                   workshops provide laboratory experiences concurrent with the                    calculus fence that is a principal curricular obstacle for such                 students (and others). The approach centers on an informal                      collaborative atmosphere in which students help each other                      solve challenging and interesting problems with non-intrusive                   guidance by carefully selected and trained graduate and                         undergraduate student leaders. This approach -- with its                        emphasis on personal attention, and interaction with peers and                  more advanced students -- yields substantial improvement in                     both student achievement and continuing interest in                             mathematics.  Specifically, the calculus workshop has raised                    the success rates (in first-term calculus) of participants from                 58% to 88% (and-from 54% to 92% for Black students). To broaden                 and enhance this workshop experience for minority and women                     students, with an eventual goal of transferring its evident                     benefits to the larger calculus student population, the                         interactive Mathematica software environment will be employed                   to involve students in symbolic, graphical, and numerical                       explorations that bridge the gap between formal manipulations                   and the more conceptual aspects of calculus.",
