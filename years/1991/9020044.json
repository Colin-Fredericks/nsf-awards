 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study tests the hypothesis that storing nitrogen over                 winter is an important adaptation in alpine plants.  The alpine                 environment is characterized by: 1) a short growing season, (2)                 low soil temperatures, and 3) low nitrogen (N) availability.  By                using N that is stored during one growing season plants can begin               growth in the following spring, even though soils are too cold                  for them to acquire N from the soil.  This may allow them to take               maximum advantage of the short alpine growth season and to                      quickly flower and set seed before the danger of frost becomes                  great.  The investigators will determine when plants are using                  nitrogen for growth, and when plants are able to take nitrogen                  from the soil.  If they find that plants start growing before                   they can acquire N in the spring, the hypothesis will be                        supported.  However, determining when N is actually available to                plants is a complicated task.  Nitrogen availability is                         determined by the amount of mineral N in the soil, the rate at                  which this N is added (from rain or snow, or from decomposition                 of old plant matter) and the relative ability of plants versus                  soil microbes to acquire this N.  Therefore, the annual pattern                 of N ion concentration in the soil, the rate of production of                   these ions from decomposition, and the relative ability of plants               and soil microbes to assimilate this nitrogen must be determined.                    The study is significant for several reasons.  First, it                   will advance basic understanding of plant N allocation and plant-               nutrient relations in the alpine environment.  The manner in                    which a plant allocates its resources can be as important as the                quantity of resources it garners from the environment in                        determining a plant's ultimate ability to survive.  Second, the                 study will address the important general question \"to what extent               do microorganisms compete for nitrogen with higher plants?\"                     Awareness is growing that such competition can have a potent                    affect on plant nutrient status.                                                     These questions have practical implications.  For example,                 an understanding of N storage in alpine plants may provide                      insight into what happens when fruit trees overwinter in                        temperate areas.  By learning how soil temperature affects N                    cycling in the alpine, scientists may be able to provide insight                into the fate of N fertilizer in cold agricultural systems with a               goal of more efficient use of fertilizer and reduced ground water               pollution by nitrogen fertilizers.  Finally, denitrification of                 nitrate into nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas) is affected by many               of the soil parameters tested in this study.  These results could               be useful in predicting the effect of polar warming on greenhouse               gas emissions from the arctic.",
