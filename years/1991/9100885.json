 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a workshop on the geology of the James                      Ross Basin, Antarctica.  The sedimentary rock sequence                          exposed within the James Ross Basin is a nearly continuous,                     richly fossiliferous record ranging in age from Late                            Cretaceous through Eocene.  Prior studies have demonstrated                     the significant role Antarctica  played in the evolution and                    dispersal of southern hemisphere terrestrial and marine                         organisms as well as in the evolution of global                                 oceanographic conditions.  However, the work has been                           performed by groups from various nations with little                            coordination.  As a result the terminology applied to                           geological and geographic features in confusing and the work                    has been repetitive and overlapping, in some cases.  Because                    it is recognized that cooperative work, involving scientists                    from several nations, would permit more efficient and                           economical use of financial and logistic resources, a                           workshop will be held to provide an opportunity to discuss                      research completed and to define objectives for gaining a                       greater understanding of the area.  It is anticipated that                      such a workshop will encourage research planning for future                     expeditions.",
