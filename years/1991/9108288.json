The                       research consists of the design, analysis, and implementation of                efficient algorithms and paradigms to solve problems in image                   analysis and computational geometry on massively parallel                       computers.  The focus of the algorithm development will be on                   fine-grained distributed memory topologies for which commercially               available machines or prototypes already exit.  These include the               mesh, hypercube, pyramid, and reconfigurable mesh.  The                         concentration will be on problems with application to robotics                  and image processing.  Initially, the following will be                         considered:  2-and 3-dimensional problems in intermediate-level                 image analysis, as well as 2- and 3-dimensional problems in                     computational geometry.  The optimality of all of the problems                  considered ar currently open problems on the appropriate                        architectures.  Further, it does not appear that for the problems               considered, algorithms for 2-dimensional objects can be extended                to solve the problems for 3-dimensional objects in optimal time.                Rather, it appears that radically different approaches will be                  required.  The problems considered involve connectivity,                        proximity, area, intersection, and minimal-area enclosing                       polygons, to name a few.",
