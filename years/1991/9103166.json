 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Elmer Miller, Judy Lustig, a graduate                student at Temple University will conduct doctoral dissertation                 research.  She will focus on the First Intermediate and Middle                  Kingdom periods of ancient Egypt and examine the relationships                  among gender ideology and roles, kinship structure and beliefs                  and practices about ancestors.  Because the database is so rich,                it will enable her to ask specific kinds of questions which                     cannot be addressed in most archaeological situations.  Primary                 sources include scenes, texts and statuary found in elite tombs                 as well as a variety of literary and religious texts concerning                 divine and human relationships and the values Egyptians attached                to these.  Cemetery, village and house plans will be utilized as                additional sources of social information.                                                                                                                       This research is of anthropological significance for several                    reasons.  It will shed light from a new perspective on the social               processes which led to the growth of Egyptian civilization.                     Secondly, it is methodologically innovative.  While an                          anthropological/archaeological approach stresses the search for                 the general rules which underlay human behavior and which are                   best revealed by their development over long periods of time,                   Egyptiologists tend to review their subject matter from a tighter               more historical perspective.  Therefore, anthropological                        archaeology and Egyptology constitute, unfortunately, two                       distinct disciplines with very little overlap and anthropologists               rarely examine Egyptian data.  Ms Lustig's research cuts across                 this divide since it will examine this Egyptian material with an                anthropologist's eye and use this database to ask anthropological               questions.  Hopefully, it will mark a path which others will                    follow.                                                                                                                                                         This project will also assist in the training of an extremely                   promising young scientist.",
