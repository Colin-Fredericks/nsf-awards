 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research process and performance consequences of changes in                various aspects of work groups.  It builds upon and is an                       extension of a continuing program of research on time in group                  interaction and performance.  The studies will make use of two                  major products of earlier work in that program:  A theory of work               in groups (called Time, Interaction and Performance, of TIP,                    theory), and a time-oriented system for analysis of interaction                 process in work groups (called Time-by-Event-by-Member Pattern                  Observation system, or TEMPO).  TIP theory predicts a number of                 important consequences for group process and outcomes, of changes               in group membership, changes in group tasks, and changes in the                 circumstances under which the group is operating.  TEMPO provides               a method for testing many of the predictions about process                      changes.  A new set of techniques, called \"process replay\", will                be developed and used to explore the situated meanings of acts                  within group process and relate those meanings to the main                      concepts of TIP theory.",
