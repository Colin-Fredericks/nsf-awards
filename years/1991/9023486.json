 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Zenderland is examining the controversies which surrounded                  psychological tests of \"intelligence\" during the decade in which                they were first introduced into American society (1908-1918).                   She focuses on the work of psychologist H. H. Goddard, America's                first intelligence tester, as he disseminated these new mental                  measuring devices into hospitals, prisons, courtrooms, and                      schoolrooms in the years before World War I.  Her research is                   based on the published and unpublished papers of psychologists,                 biologists, physicians, and educators most active in these early                testing debates.  She argues that the earliest American promoters               and critics of intelligence testing cannot simply be dichotomized               as believers in \"nature\" or \"nurture\";  instead, their work needs               to be explained within a multidimensional context emphasizing a                 range of scientific, professional, and political controversies of               the progressive period.  To carry out this research, she is                     examining papers on this topic at the Archives of the History of                American Psychology.  The study resulting from this grant will be               both the first biography of Goddard and the first detailed                      examination of the intelligence testing movement in its early                   years in America.  As the debates about the nature of                           \"intelligence\" continue to this day, this project promises                      significant contributions in placing the debate's origins in                    proper perspective.",
