 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project involves performing an extensive range of                           experiments designed to enhance the use of ion beams for the                    study of surface chemistry.   These experiments are designed to                 (i) elucidate the fundamental aspects of ion/solid collisions,                  (ii) to characterize the chemistry and structure of solid                       surfaces using the basic information obtained in (i), and                       (iii) to optimize the application of ion beams in trace                         molecular analysis of surfaces and in submicron imaging.                        The use of multiphoton resonance ionization spectroscopy will                   enable neutral species to be ionized with both temporal and                     spatial resolution by using a movable mass spectrometer to                      measure the trajectories of the secondary ions produced.  This                  will enable the measurement of neutrals, excited neutrals, and                  ions desorbed from well-defined surfaces subjected to ion                       bombardment.    The experimental results will be compared with                  a theoretical model which uses molecular dynamics simulations.                  New experimental geometries will be determined by the use of                    shadow-cone enhanced desorption.   New experiments in the trace                 molecular analysis of surfaces and in submicron atomic and                      molecular imaging will also be performed.                                                                                                                       %%%                                                                                                                                                             The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                     Chemistry, focuses on the use of energetic ion beams (of                        several thousand electron volts in energy) in surface chemistry                 research.   These experiments promise to provide the most                       complete picture so far developed of ion/solid interactions,                    new approaches to the determination of surface chemical                         geometries, new methods for trace molecular analysis of                         surfaces, and new approaches to the atomic and molecular                        imaging of surfaces.  The results from these studies should                     find widespread applications in such diverse fields as high                     molecular weight mass spectrometry, astrophysics, fusion                        reactor design, and ion implantation and etching of electronic                  materials.",
