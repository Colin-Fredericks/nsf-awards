 "awd_abstract_narration": "Timing of early embryonic cell divisions is crucial for                         establishing the coordinated interactions necessary for normal                  development. Dr. Hecht will investigate a pathway responsible for               initiating zygotic control of cell lineage division in the                      nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. The regulation and function of                the emb-29V gene, defined by temperature sensitive alleles that                 arrest embryonic cell divisions at or near the G2/M interface,                  will be investigated. An understanding of the mechanisms                        controlling the expression and function of this strict non-                     maternal gene product will provide insights into those factors                  that interact with an important genetic element required for                    entry into the mitotic stage of different embryonic cell                        lineages. To achieve these goals the emb-29 gene will be                        identified and isolated by transformation rescue. Emb-29 will                   then be sequenced. Probes for emb-29's mRNA and its encoded                     protein will be used to determine the cell lineage onset and                    intracellular localizations of the emb-29 gene product. Putative                DNA regulatory domains will be identified by a comparative                      sequence analysis of the homologous gene from the related species               C. briggsae. The in vivo and in vitro function of these domains                 will be determined by transformation and DNA gel-shift assays,                  respectively. The properties of the recombinantly expressed gene                product will be biochemically determined and in conjunction with                the isolation and analysis of suppressor genes, the investigation               of interacting components will be initiated. In this manner, the                genetically and biochemically defined elements involved in the                  modulation and expression of an essential gene controlling one of               the pathways necessary for embryonic cell lineage proliferation                 will be understood.",
