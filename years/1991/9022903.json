 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Christophorou is supported by a grant from the                        Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study electron                       attachment to electronically excited states of molecules.                       These measurements are of interest in radiation chemistry, for                  example.  When ionizing radiation slows down due to                             interactions with matter it produces an abundance of excited                    molecules or fragments of molecules and slow electrons.  The                    high probability of capture of slow electrons by excited                        molecules is Professor Christophorou's important discovery.                                                                                                     This project will identify molecules which can be excited to                    superexcited states and determine whether the observed                          extremely large cross sections for electron attachment to                       low-lying excited states are common to all molecules.  These                    measurements are difficult because one has to first produce                     large numbers of electronically excited molecules then carry                    out electron attachment measurements before they relax back to                  the ground electronic state.",
