 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Ofer Bar-Yosef, Professor of                         Anthropology at Harvard University, Mr. Ian Kuijt will collect                  data for his doctoral dissertation. Mr. Kuijt will build upon                   preliminary excavations conducted at the early Neolithic site of                'Iraq ed-Dubb which is located northwest of Ajlun, Jordan and                   situated in an extensively forested region 550 meters above sea                 level.  Previous work indicates that this cave site was occupied                ca. 10,000 years ago and that it contains an oval stone                         structures with multiple mud floors, indicating repeated                        occupation.  Mr. Kuijt and his colleagues will conduct one season               of research which combines continued excavations inside the cave                with limited survey and excavations outside of it and in front of               neighboring caves.  Within the cave wide horizontal exposure will               delineate and excavate two of the stone structures (the third has               already been exposed).  Floral and faunal materials will be                     collected and analyzed and these will provide information on both               basic subsistence and season of occupation.  Lithic materials                   will be examined to determine sources of origin and to                          reconstruct how the inhabitants moved over the landscape.                                                                                                       The early Neolithic in the Near East dates to ca. 10,000 years                  ago and marks the first domestication of plants and animals in                  the Old World.  Intensive archaeological attention has been                     focussed on the low lying areas within the Jordan Valley where                  this process, in part at least, appears to have taken place.                    Little is known however how such sites fit into a broader                       regional context and whether, for example, these first                          agriculturalists relied completely on new food crops or whether                 they incorporated them into a broader seasonal round which                      included hunting and gathering.  If the former is the case then                 it is unclear how lowland agriculturalists interacted with                      hunting and gathering populations from higher elevations.  In                   this context, the site of 'Iraq ed-Dubb is both important and                   unique because of its location in just such a highland area.                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                archaeological data from an unknown area/period which will be of                interest to a wide group of scientists.  It will increase our                   understanding of how complex agriculturally based societies                     emerged and will assist in the training of an extremely promising               young scientist.",
