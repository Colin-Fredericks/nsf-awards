 "awd_abstract_narration": "Between 1945 and 1961, West German chemical producers made the                  transition from primarily coal-based to predominately petroleum-                based feedstocks for manufacture of organic chemicals, thus                     following American leadership in petrochemical technology and                   ensuring their long-term competitiveness.  Dr. Stokes is examining              this significant change, combining approaches drawn from political              and economic history with those from history of technology.  This               study will contribute to broader issues including the political,                economic and social factors affecting technological choice;                     technological transfer in its political context, and the state's                role in shaping technological development.                                                                                                                      Under this grant, Dr. Stokes is completing research including                   travel to Germany to examine the archives of the BASF and Bayer                 companies and Federal Archives in Koblenz.  This research promises              to produce a detailed examination of the emergence of the West                  German petrochemical industry.  Understanding how this German                   industry transformed itself from technological backwardness                     (compared to its British and American counterparts) to world                    leadership will shed light on the process and effective strategies              of technological change.  It will also help us to understand the                bases of West Germany's political, economic, and technological                  performance in the postwar world.",
