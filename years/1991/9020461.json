 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earthworms affect many basic soil processes, but the overall                    impact of these important invertebrates on ecosystem-level                      processes are poorly understood.  Drs. Stinner, Blair and Edwards               suggest that earthworms are key organisms affecting the structure               and function of decomposer communities and soil processes in many               terrestrial ecosystems, including agroecosystems.  This research                examines the importance of earthworms as regulators of decomposer               community structure, organic matter decomposition and N cycling                 in agroecosystems based on organic or inorganic sources of                      nutrients. Earthworm populations in field enclosures will be                    manipulated in three experimental agroecosystems where N is                     supplied primarily as  i) legume-derived N, ii) animal manure N,                or iii) inorganic fertilizer.  Organic matter decomposition and N               cycling processes will be used as integrating variables to assess               the effects of earthworm activity on agroecosystem function.                    The following effects will be quantified: a) soil microbial                     numbers and activity, b) populations of other soil                              invertebrates, c)  organic matter decomposition and changes in                  soil organic matter fractions, d) soil physical characteristics,                e) partitions of N into selected above- and below-ground pools                  (plant biomass N, litter N, SOM , active (microbial) soil N,                    slow/passive soil N, extractable soil N); and f) rates and                      patterns of release of N from 15N-labelled plant residues,                      recovery in selected soil pools and plant uptake of N.                                                                                                          This approach provides a unique, holistic perspective of the                    importance of earthworms in affecting ecosystem-level processes.                Examining the effects of earthworms in systems based on organic                 inputs or inorganic N will provide data on the relative impact of               earthworms in systems under different degrees of C or N                         limitation.  Analysis of the interactive effects of earthworms                  and organic matter inputs on soil biota and processes will                      provide new insights into the basic mechanisms affecting N use                  efficiency and conservation in terrestrial ecosystems in general.               The research will also contribute greatly to an understanding of                regulation by earthworms of N dynamics in both organic N-based                  agroecosystems and conventional inorganically fertilized                        agroecosystems.  The support and facilities for this research are               outstanding.",
