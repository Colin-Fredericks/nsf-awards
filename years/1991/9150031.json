Courses will be developed in chemistry, physics,                     biology, and earth science.  The themes of global change,                       Florida's fragile environment, and Science/Technology/Society                   will be interwoven into all these courses.  The courses will                    be taught from a constructivist perspective, providing                          students with hands-on group experiences in science and                         opportunities for constructing their own understanding of                       science concepts.  The diverse group of faculty that will be                    involved in developing the courses includes scientists,                         science educators, and experts in multicultural education, the                  history and philosophy of science, and linguistic issues in                     teaching science.  The University's system of Professional                      Development Schools will serve as the setting for the science                   methods course and field experiences, and the project will                      work closely with teachers and students at these schools.  A                    network will be established by the State Department of                          Education to disseminate plans and materials to other colleges                  and universities in the Florida.  The University's cost-                        sharing is 15% of NSF's contribution.",
