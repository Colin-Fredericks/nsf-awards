 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the past decade it has become evident that                               bacterioplankton contribute significantly to biomass and                        biogeochemical activity in planktonic systems.  Until recently                  progress in identifying the microbial species which constitute                  these communities was slow because the majority of the                          organisms present (direct counts) could not be recovered in                     culture.  Recently introduced molecular techniques are                          providing the means to study the population dynamics of                         uncultivated microbial species.                                                                                                                                 This project is based on molecular data which demonstrates the                  existence of a novel microbial group, the SAR11 cluster, and                    indicates that this group accounts for about  20% of the non-                   cyanobacterial microbial activity in the Sargasso Sea. The                      SAR11 cluster is a related group of species which were detected                 by cloning 16S ribosomal DNA genetic markers from a natural                     Sargasso Sea bacterioplankton population.  This research will                   extend earlier observations by providing time-series and depth                  profile information on the distribution of these organisms at                   the BATS station in the Sargasso Sea, where they were first                     observed.  The dynamics of seasonal changes in the Sargasso Sea                 bacterioplankton community will be measured using specific DNA                  probes for the SAR11 cluster (SAR11R) and marine Synechococcus                  (SYNF), as well as general probes for eubacterial, eukaryotic                   and universal small subunit ribosomal RNAs.  The specific goals                 of the project are:  1) to test the hypothesis that the SAR11                   cluster population reaches a numerical maximum during summer                    stratification; 2) to test the hypothesis that the SAR11                        cluster is distributed widely in the upper euphotic zone                        ofoligotrophic oceanic regions; 3) to test the hypothesis that                  the distribution of the SAR11 cluster is correlated with                        aerobic photoheterotrophic activity; 4) to provide parallel                     time series information on the distribution of other planktonic                 bacterial groups which are being revealed by further genetic                    studies nearing completion.                                                                                                                                     The theory that bacterial photoheterotrophy is an active                        process in the open ocean can potentially have a dramatic                       influence on calculations of carbon flux through the microbial                  loop.  The standing crop of \"heterotrophic\" bacterioplankton is                 too large to be explained form primary productivity estimates                   using a standard 0.6 respiratory conversion factor, but could                   be better explained using the higher growth efficiencies                        associated with photoheterotrophy.",
