The principal investigator will consider problems                     pertaining to an algebraic and topological investigation of                     partially ordered sets of combinatorial objects, sorting of                     partially ordered sets, and graph coloring in connection with                   distributed computing.                                                               This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,                which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                  Combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of all             mathematical activities, counting.  In its modern development,                  however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of             a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques.  The field has              had an explosive development in the past few decades because of its             importance in communications and information technology.",
