 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is planned to develop abstract structures to represent                  mathematical objects for the purposes of editing, display and                   computation.  These structures are to be modifiable through free-               form editing, in the spirit of blackboard mathematics, yet easily               converted to typesetting languages like TEX, and symbolic                       manipulation package like MACSYMA and Mathematica.                              The most interesting technical problems raised by the proposal                  derive from the tension between these two criteria: a natural                   interface with the mathematician, and an ability to recognize and               manipulate the highly structured objects that are informally                    being described.  The abstract structures will mediate between                  the informal notation that the mathematician is comfortable with                and the more formal demands of computation.  These structures,                  properly formulated, can also serve as vehicles to store and                    communicate mathematical content in a natural way, independent of               any particular format.                                                          The goal is to provide theoretical constructs for a computer-                   based system for doing mathematics.  This system will be able to                create input to typesetting systems and to interact with symbolic               computing packages; it will provide assistance in the                           preparation of mathematical documents from the initial ideas to                 the form.  The constructs can be modeled by object-oriented                     programming language like C++.",
