 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focusses on the traditional travel culture of the                 Inupiat Eskimo of northern Alaska and the effects of recent                     cultural changes on travel behavior and spatial skills. Included                in the study will be an analysis of how travel skills are passed                on to the younger generation who do not have the same subsistence               pressures as earlier generations. Special attention will be given               to disorientation experiences. Extensive interviews will be carried             out in the communities of Barrow, Wainwright and Anaktuvuk Pass.                                                                                                The significance of the study rests partly in the urgency of                    recording traditional knowledge which is rapidly disappearing, and              partly in analyzing how modern technology and culture have altered              travel culture in the Arctic. Travel and orientation knowledge was              a key element of survival in the past. Today, modern technology has             enabled rapid transportation but the loss of survival skills has                drastically increased the incidence of accidental death among the               Eskimo.",
