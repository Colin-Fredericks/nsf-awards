 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the travel of two minority high                        school students and their chaperon from Benjamin Banneker                       High School in Washington, DC to the Computer Museum in                         Boston, MA.  The purpose of the trip is to reward the winners                   of the NSF/Banneker Computer Contest with an experience which                   exposes them to scientists and new technology in the computer                   and information sciences.  Benjamin Banneker High School is                     the NSF partnership school.  During the six weeks prior to                      National Science and Technology Week a computer programming                     contest was conducted at Benjamin Banneker High School.  The                    contest was open to all students and about 20 participated.                     There were five finalists and two were selected by a panel of                   judges from NSF as grand prize winners.  Dr. Strimpel of the                    Computer Museum will host the visit.  The students will be                      given a tour of the Museum facilities as well as the Boston                     University Center for Computational Science, where they will                    meet several people working in computational science.//",
