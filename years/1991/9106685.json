 "awd_abstract_narration": "The heliobacteria, a newly discovered family of non-oxygen                      evolving photosynthetic bacteria, have a reaction center that                   is broadly similar to Photosystem I of oxygen evolving                          organisms.  The goal of this project is to develop the                          heliobacteria as a bacterial model for Photosystem I in the                     same way that the purple photosynthetic bacterial have been                     very successfully used as a model for Photosystem II.  Dr.                      Blankenship isolated the reaction center from Heliobacillus                     mobilis in an active form,, and is characterizing its chemical                  and physical properties using a variety of techniques.                                                                                                          Preliminary femtosecond absorption difference spectra suggest                   that a 670 nm absorbing species is not the primary electron                     acceptor in the heliobacteria, in contrast to reports from                      other laboratories.  Experiments are proposed to identify the                   chemical nature of the primary acceptor.  Redox titrations                      indicate that a species that undergoes two electron reduction                   under some conditions is an early acceptor.  This species is                    probably a menaquinone, analogous to the phylloquinone acceptor                 A1 in Photosystem I. Experiments are proposed to characterize                   this acceptor, as well as subsequent Fe-S protein acceptors.                    The properties of the membrane-bound cytochrome that acts as                    electron donor to the reaction center will also be                              investigated.",
