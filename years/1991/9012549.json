 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to their potential for high reliability and throughput via the              multiplicity of components, distributed computing systems are being             increasingly used for reliability- and time-critical applications.              However, the probability of having one or more component failures               in a distributed system increases with the number of components                 used.  Thus, the ability of locating faulty components, isolating               them, reconfiguring the system, and resuming the computation is a               key to the success in realizing the potential of any distributed                system.  As part of the global goal of designing fault-tolerant                 distributed systems, this project is concerned with system-level                fault diagnosis for large multiprocessor/multicomputer systems.                 A thorough survey of the currently available methods for diagnosis              of large systems has led to a conclusion that a probabilistic                   approach is the most promising.  A probabilistic diagnosis approach             allows for the diagnosis of multiprocessor/multicomputer systems                with both intermittent and permanent faults, using high-level tests             which have imperfect fault coverage and/or are executed on-line.                The first step of this project is to develop optimal solutions to               the probabilistic diagnosis problem using single or multiple fault              syndromes.  The second step is to efficiently implement these                   solutions as distributed algorithms.  This task is non-trivial                  since the identity of faulty communication links and processing                 nodes cannot be assumed to be known \"a priori\".  Finally, the                   probabilistic diagnosis will be implemented and their performance               will be measured on an experimental multicomputer system, called                HARTS, which is currently being built at the Real-Time Computing                Laboratory (RTCL), The University of Michigan.",
