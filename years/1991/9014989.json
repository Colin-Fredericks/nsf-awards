Each five-day conference features a distinguished                    lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic of important                      current research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical                sciences.  The lecturer subsequently prepares an expository                     monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally published                by the American Mathematical Society or the Society for                         Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American                  Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical                       Statistics.  Certain features differentiate these conferences                   from typical research conferences.  These are: (1) Focus on a                   single important and timely area of research by a leading                       practitioner, (2) Continued effect and local stimulation through                regional emphasis, (3) Panel review for quality, breadth, and                   timeliness, and (4) Published monographs for a wider audience.                       This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research                    Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on The Mathematics of                   Control Theory to be held May 30 - June 4, 1991 at Louisiana                    State University.  Professor Ivan Kupka of the University of                    Toronto will be the principal lecturer.",
