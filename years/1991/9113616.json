 "awd_abstract_narration": "Various quinone methides, which are proposed to be key                          intermediates in the formation of naturally occurring products,                 will be prepared and studied. The objectives of this study will be              to: (1) obtain a structure-activity relationship for the fate of                quinone methides, (2) to generate quinone methides by laser flash               photolysis and study their properties directly, and (3) to trap                 quinone methides as cyclopropyl derivatives. Structure-activity                 relationships involving the reactions of electrophiles and                      nucleophiles with quinone methide derivatives of naphthalene,                   anthracene, isoquinoline, and indole will be pursued. These                     derivatives are chosen because of their similarity to natural                   products. The laser flash generation of quinone methides will                   allow UV-visible spectral studies of these intermediates, quinone               methide pKa determinations, and kinetic studies of the fate of the              quinone methide. To provide further evidence for quinone methide                intermediates, benzimidazole derivatives will be formed where the               intermediate quinone methide will be trapped as a                               spirocyclopropane derivative.                                                   %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of               Professor Edward Skibo at Arizona State University. Quinone                     methides are reactive intermediates that have been proposed to be               key intermediates in the synthesis of naturally occurring                       molecules that are found in plants. Since quinone methides are                  very reactive, they are normally produced in very low                           concentration and cannot be detected directly by spectroscopic                  methods. In this research, these intermediates will be generated                by an intense light source to give high concentrations of the                   quinone methides so that they can be detected by spectroscopic                  measurements. The presence of these intermediates will also be                  detected indirectly by trapping reactions to give a product that                is indicative of these intermediates. In addition, a relationship               between the structure of quinone methides and their reactivity                  with other species will be determined. These studies will make it               possible to understand the origin of a large class of natural                   products and to develop new methods for the reductive cleavage of               DNA.",
