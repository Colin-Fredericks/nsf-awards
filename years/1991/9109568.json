 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on complete fault coverage (at low cost) for                   synchronous sequential circuits.  A test generation strategy, which             alleviates the limitations of existing test generation procedures               is being investigated.  The essence of the approach is in the                   multiple time observation assumption, which removes the requirement             that a fault be detected by observation of the circuit's response               at a single time unit.  A fault model comprised of single and                   multiple transition faults, which covers many gate level stuck at               faults, is being explored.  Test generation procedures are aimed                at medium sized and large circuits, described as interconnections               of submachines.  Algorithms for decomposition of such circuits are              being investigated.  A comprehensive set of tools is being designed             especially for the purpose of achieving complete fault coverage.                The tools include: test generation, simulation, extraction and                  decomposition procedures.",
