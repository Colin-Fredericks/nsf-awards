 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a comprehensive inservice program involving                     Washington State University, the State Office of Public                         Instruction, private foundations, government and private                        industrial laboratories and local schhool districts.  The program               is targeted at out-of-field teachers of high school chemistry and               culminates in a Master of Arts Degree in Chemistry.  Thirty                     teachers from the Northwest states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho                 and Montana will be selected each year to participate in a three-               year program which will include two one-month periods of                        instruction on the University Campus, four semesters of                         instruction during the academic years via satellite and a                       capstone six-week assignment in an industrial laboratory coupled                with on-site instruction. Ninety teachers of high school                        chemistry will participate in this program, earning an MA in                    Chemistry.  Satellite two-way video and audio telecommunications                will allow participants from long distances to benefit from on-                 site instruction. This new program will include offerings such as               General Chemistry from an Advanced Point of View, a two semester                Organic and Biochemistry Sequence and Physical Chemistry for the                Life Sciences.  These are not regular departmental offerings, but               are based on the expressed needs of these teachers. The third                   summer will be spent in a laboratory, such as Battelle and other                industrial labs. This program will provide a firm basis for the                 teaching of chemistry including modern applications and an                      enhanced knowledge base of instructional strategies as well as                  career opportunities for future chemists.                                                                                                                       The NSF request is for the support of the first group of thirty                 teachers plus the instructional costs for all three years.  The                 support for the sixty other teachers as well as the                             institutionalization of the program will be forthcoming from                    other funds.  NSF funding is approximately 20% of the cost of the               whole project.",
