 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dasyurids are the dominant terrestrial carnivores of Australia,                 occupying a diverse array of habitats such as aridlands, forest,                and alpine heath.  They are small to medium sized mammals, ranging              from the tiny Pilbara ningaui (209 g) to the dog-sized Tasmanian                devil (6-8 kg).  With approximately 51 species in 17 genera, the                family Dasyuridae constitutes one of three major lineages of                    Australasian marsupials.  Attempts to understand the evolutionary               relationships among dasyurids date from the early 20th century, but             these efforts could only reveal the broadest outlines of phylogeny.             In recent years, comparative study of molecular genetic variation               among dasyurids has shed much light on relationships within the                 family, but a detailed and well-resolved branching order for genera             has not been established.  This lack of phylogenetic resolution has             hampered efforts to understand the historical biogeography of                   dasyurids, particularly the origins of New Guinean endemics.                                                                                                    In this study, DNA sequence variation in the mitochondrial                      cytochrome-b gene will be assayed for representatives of all                    dasyurid genera.  Cytochrome-b, a key component in cellular energy              production, is a relatively small (ca. 400 residues) and simple                 molecule.  Patterns of DNA variation in cytochrome-b across the                 range of divergence times represented by dasyurids will allow                   construction of a simple model of how the gene evolves.  The value              of such a model for estimating phylogeny is a key issue in modern               molecular systematics.  The data and model together will provide                an interesting means of comparing several current and conceptually              distinct methods of phylogenetic inference.  Final results should               provide a clearer picture of dasyurid relationships, as well as a               better understanding of cytochrome-b evolution and molecular                    phylogenetics.",
