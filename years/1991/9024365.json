 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuous-fiber reinforced plastics are superior mechanically             to short-fiber reinforced plastics.  However, components fabricated             from continuously reinforced plastics are labor-intensive, time                 consuming and expensive.  In phase I and in response to industrial              demand, an innovative system to mold quality, discontinuous long-               fiber, reinforced plastic products to net dimension was developed.              Results of the American Society of Testing Materials test specimens             molded from either virgin or virgin/recycled materials and scanning             electron microscope and ashing data, substantiate the advantageous              mechanical/physical performance of such composite components.  The              mechanical advantages were achieved without sacrificing the design              and processing flexibilities or economical advantages of using                  short-fiber composites.  The use of recycled feed-stock also has                favorable environmental implications.                                                In phase II the pioneer equipment will be developed into a                 prototype system for its commercialization and that of its                      products.  The use of other virgin and recycled feed-stock                      materials will be evaluated and process optimization for molding                various materials into industrial products will be conducted.",
