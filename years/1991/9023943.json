 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iron reduction is an important ecological process in marine                     environments since availability can be a limiting factor in both                the primary productivity of surface waters and the                              remineralization of organic matter in bottom sediments. The                     primary objective of this project is to use molecular probes to                 study the microbial ecology of iron-reducing bacteria in                        anaerobic marine environments.  Ferri-reductase antibody probes,                ferri-reductase structural gene probes and genera-specific rRNA                 probes will be constructed and used to determine: (1) the                       distribution and (2) the environmental parameters which control                 expression of iron reduction genes and enzymes in those                         environments.  In order to construct the ferri-reductase                        molecular probes, the project will initially focus on                           understanding the process of microbial iron reduction.                          Shewanella putrefaciens will be used as a model iron-reducing                   marine organism, selected largely because it is commonly isolated               from a variety of marine sources, and because of its unique                     metabolic versatility: S. putrefaciens is capable of coupling the               oxidation of an extensive array of organic compounds to the                     reduction of many of the respiratory electron acceptors found in                marine environments including O2, NO3-, NO2-, MnO2, SO32- and                   Fe(III).  Preliminary molecular work has centered on the                        isolation and characterization of mutant strains deficient in                   iron reduction capability.  The project will use complimentary                  genetic and biochemical techniques to clone and characterize the                genes and gene products involved in expression of a functional                  ferri-reductase.  Ferri-reductase antibody probes and ferri-                    reductase structural gene probes will be constructed and used in                ecological studies to detect the presence of iron-reducing                      bacteria in marine waters and sediments, and to determine which                 environmental parameters control expression of iron reduction                   genes and enzymes in those environments.  Results from the                      project will provide details on the molecular biology and ecology               of microbially-mediated iron reduction in the marine environment.//",
