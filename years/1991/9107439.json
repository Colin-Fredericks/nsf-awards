 "awd_abstract_narration": "Resource dilemmas are created when group members shared limited                 resources to which all have free access(e.g., groundwater, energy,              minerals, endangered species.)  When group members request their                share from the resource pool independently, with no communication               among them, there is experimental evidence showing that as the                  uncertainty about the size of the resource increases, people                    increase their requests thereby lowering the probability that their             request will be granted.  Six experiments are proposed to study the             effects of several variables (e.g., amount of uncertainty about the             resource, group size, real-time updating of information about total             group request) about the resolution of resource dilemmas under two              protocols of play.  Under one protocol, requests are made                       simultaneously, and under the other, sequentially with full                     information about previous requests.  The proposed experiments are              driven by a game theoretical model prescribing an equilibrium                   solution and by a decision theoretical model.  The findings should              be useful in understanding the effects of alternative mechanisms                on decision behavior in resource dilemmas, which are among the most             serious problems facing modern society.",
