 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of large-scale collaborative research is not well                   understood by historians, sociologists and other scholars.                      Nor do scientists, research administrators and the public                       possess any of the systematic analysis of this centrally                        important activity.  Under this grant, Ms. Warnow is continuing                 her study of the problems of documenting the history of large                   collaborations in physics and allied sciences.  Currently their                 administrative and intellectual records are widely dispersed and                often discarded.  Until the documentation has been secured it will              be impossible for scholars to study the collaborative research                  project.                                                                                                                                                        Under her prior grants, Ms. Warnow has studied the patterns of                  team formation, funding, communication, delegation of                           responsibility, and publication, as well as the creation and                    retention of records in the area of high energy physics.  Under                 this grant, Ms. Warnow is trying to determine how far insights                  from high energy physics extend to other fields of science.                     Specifically, she is undertaking a two year study of space                      science and geophysics.  She is directing a group of researchers                who will (1) conduct a computerized statistical census of a                     large number of collaborations, (2) interview some 150-200                      members of a selected sample of collaborations involving satellites,            planetary spacecraft, oceanographic expeditions, and other system               for data-gathering (drill holes and seismic networks and arrays),               and (3) conduct detailed historical probes of a few especially                  important cases.  The aim is to identify patterns of collaboration,             define the documentation problems, field-test possible solutions                to these problems, and recommend actions to facilitate future                   scholarly study.  The PI and other AIP staff will be joined by                  archivists, historians, and sociologists; distinguished scientists,             administrators, and other specialists are serving as advisors on                the project.",
