 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcium-activated non-specific cation (CAN) channels play a                     crucial role in the generation and modulation of bursting                       activity in neurons.  Bursting, the grouping of action potentials               in high periodic frequency discharges, is an important neuronal                 property characteristic of such phenomena as pacemaking and                     neurosecretion.  Because CAN channels have a central function in                burst generation, their characteristics are significant                         determinants in neuron encoding.  The goal of this research                     project is to investigate the selectivity and voltage dependence                of CAN channels.  Dr. Partridge will study these channels by                    using the patch clamp technique, an experimental technique which                allows for the study of single channels in isolation.  Studies on               how CAN channel activity is modulated by phosphorylation, the                   modification of protein structure induced by the attachment of                  phosphate groups, will be performed.  This investigation explores               basic neuronal properties important to the signalling function in               the nervous system.",
