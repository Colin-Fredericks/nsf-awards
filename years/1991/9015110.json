 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Peter Lamb of the University of Illinois/State Water Survey                     Division and Dr. Neville Nicholls of the Australian Bureau of                   Meterorology Research Centre. This research is to extend and                    broaden a University of Illinois/State Water Survey research                    program concerned with the design of growing season climate                     predictions for midwestern agriculture. In this cooperative                     project, the U.S. effort will be extended to address the                        climate prediction design issue for grain sorghum production                    in northeastern Australia. This new research will enhance the                   extensive economic modeling capabilities developed by the                       U.S. midwestern work. It will also attempt to exploit the                       substantial growing season climate prediction skill that is                     inherent in the strong control that the El Nino-Southern                        Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon exerts on northeastern Australian                 rainfall. The project will provide a perspective on results                     reached for the U.S. Midwest (where the growing season                          climate is less predictable), furnish a better understanding                    of the value of currently achievable climate prediction                         skill, provide a modus operandi for designing and valuing                       climate prediction systems for other sectors of Australian                      agriculture, as well as for developing nations whose growing                    season rainfall is strongly controlled by ENSO.                                                                                                                 The project represents excellent collaboration in combining                     Australian atmospheric scientist expertise and Australian                       data on Southern Oscillation (SO)-based seasonal rainfall                       with the extensive economic modeling capabilities of the                        U.S.research team. This is important fundamental work on                        climate prediction design research, as well as having                           potential for improving agricultural productivity.",
