 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many outstanding problems in meteorology and climate                       research would benefit greatly from the availability of                         inexpensive in-situ measurements of the atmosphere, particularly                in remote regions of the globe such as over the oceans where                    conventional measurement systems are few or non-existent.  The                  National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has developed a                 family of lightweight digital dropwindsondes, and Aurora Flight                 Sciences Corporation has developed a low-cost Unmanned Scientific               Research Aircraft (USRA) called Perseus.  The goal of this SBIR                 project is to combine the digital dropwindsonde with the with the               USRA to produce a flexible, low-cost system for providing in-situ               atmospheric measurements.  During Phase I, the principal                        investigators will fabricate a dispenser for the NCAR                           dropwindsondes and install it on the Aurora Perseus proof-of-                   concept aircraft.  The dispenser concept will be tested as part                 of Perseus' engineering flight tests in early 1991.  The receiver               and data processing unit for this demonstration will be ground                  based.  During Phase II, a dedicated airborne data collection and               processing system will be developed.",
