 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many transition metal complexes behave as bases as illustrated                  by their reactions with protonic acids to give metal hydrides.                  There is evidence that this basicity also influences other                      types of reactivity of these complexes.  To understand these                    reactivities, basicities of a variety of transition metal                       complexes will be determined by measuring their heats of                        protonation calorimetrically with triflic acid.  Series of                      mononuclear complexes with a variety of ligands will be studied                 systematically in order to establish quantitative relationships                 between the metal basicity and the natures of the ligands                       attached to it.  Electronic and steric effects of monodentate                   ligands will be examined, and basicity changes caused by                        distortions of reactant and/or product structures induced by                    chelating ligands will be studied.  Also, factors which affect                  basicities of dinuclear and cluster complexes, where                            protonation occurs on a metal-metal bond, will be investigated.                 In order to understand how metal complex basicities influence                   other types of complex reactivity, rates of a variety of                        oxidative-addition reactions will be determined and correlated                  with the enthalpy values; such linear free energy correlations                  should be extremely useful guides to understanding a broad                      range of transition metal complex reactivity.                                   %%%                                                                             In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                             Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Robert J.                 Angelici of Iowa State University will continue thermochemical                  and reactivity studies of a variety of transition metal                         complexes.  It is possible that a limited set of thermochemical                 data may allow accurate predictions of a large range of                         chemical reactivities, a predictive capability that could prove                 very useful in the design of certain catalysts.",
