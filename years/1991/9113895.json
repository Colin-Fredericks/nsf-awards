 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spectral methods have been widely applied for transient and                     turbulent flows.  However their scope of application has been                   seriously limited by their inability to treat discontinuous                     problems and problems on nonsmooth domains.  This project                       intends to reduce these two restrictions of spectral methods.                   Oscillation-free uniform high order spectral methods to simulate                chemically reacting flows, especially the detonation waves and                  the transition from deflagration to detonation (DDT) will be                    designed.  To ease the domain restrictions, spectral methods and                the p- and the h-p version of the finite element methods will be                combined.  Then the combined method will be applied to general                  elliptic equations on nonsmooth domains and the results will be                 used to simulate flows in irregular channels.  These methods will               be implemented on high performance computers.",
