 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on an approach to automating the                  arrangement and subsequent drawing of the classical plant layout                problem.  New factors are included that are not addressed in basic              approaches such as Computerized Resource Allocation of Facilities               Technique (CRAFT).  These factors are fixed department shapes that              can be unequal in size, location dependent construction cost, and               location constraints for a subset of departments.                                    The approach is based on recent developments in plant layout,              namely, simulated annealing, cluster analysis, cut-tree                         representations, and network models of packing problems.  A unique              combination of these approaches will be studied in connection with              a branch and bound approach to solve this problem with a high                   probability of finding the optimum.  The approach will also                     highlight changes in requirements that will render an infeasible                problem feasible.  Subjective considerations from current                       approaches are removed with algorithmic approaches such as the                  assignment algorithm.  The solution system will allow an attack on              plant space reallocation and department relocation because of the               feasibility feature and constraint feature.",
