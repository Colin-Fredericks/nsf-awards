 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a laboratory study of the chemistry of atmospheric                 trace gases in contact with solid surfaces, representative of the               particulate matter of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs).  The                   solid matter will be ordinary water ice or frozen nitric acid                   trihydrate, which are believed to be constituents of the PSCs.                  Trace gases whose chemical reactions will be studied on the ice                 surfaces will be chlorine nitrate and nitrogen pentoxide.  The                  ice solids will be studied both with and without dissolved                      impurities like hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, and hydrogen               fluoride.  Solubilities of the impurities in the ices will be                   determined under a range of experimental conditions.                                                                                                                 The progress of chemical interactions between the gases and                the solids will be followed by simultaneous mass spectroscopy of                the gases and by infrared spectroscopy of the solids.  This will                allow real-time observations of the mutual interactions of the                  gases and the ice solids.                                                                                                                                            Water ice and frozen nitric acid trihydrate in the polar                   stratospheric clouds are believed to act as catalysts for                       chemical reactions of chlorine- and nitrogen-containing gases                   involved in ozone depletion in the stratosphere.  These                         laboratory studies will develop new information about detailed                  chemical and physical mechanisms of transformations of chlorine                 and nitrogen compounds in the stratospheric ozone layer.  Such                  information will help to confirm (or modify?) present beliefs                   about ozone depletion in the stratosphere and will help us                      understand the timing of ozone depletion and its relationships to               geographic factors.",
