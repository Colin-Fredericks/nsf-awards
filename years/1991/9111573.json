 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project initiates the first year of a five-year                       continuing award to the University of Arkansas to join with the                 University of Cincinnati and Florida Atlantic University in merging             with Georgia Institute of Technology's Industry/University                      Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling.                                   The university has developed the company support to be added               to the Center's industry base.  The research projects approved by               the new consolidated Industry Advisory Board for the University of              Arkansas are \"Improved Postal Pak Operations\", \"Analysis of Flat                Mail Containers\", \"Simulation Methodology to Support Process                    Manufacturing\", and \"Analysis of the Warehouse Layout Problems for              an Electronic Assembly Environment.\"                                                 A minority woman graduate student will augment the Center's                research by studying \"the Extension of JIT Software Development to              Manufacturing Automation Alternatives.\"                                              The researchers are experts in their fields and have the                   capability and facilities to participate in the new merged Center.                   The Program Manager recommends the University of Arkansas be               awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing grant.             An additional $20,500 for one year is recommended with funds                    provided by the Research Centers for Minority Scholars Program.                      Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                   and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review             the progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the               following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                     interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to                  which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                  robust research program is developing.  If the review is                        satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support of the                next period of this continuing grant.",
