 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-year New York City Mathematics Project is a staff                     development effort for mathematics teachers grades K through 12,                modeled on the National Writing Project. The teachers will come                 from six districts in the Bronx. Through after school courses,                  summer institutes, leadership seminars, on-site consulting, and                 the development of a mathematics resource center, a cadre of                    mathematics teacher leaders will be established. A total of                     ninety teachers will be involved in the project; 30 of these will               be part of the project for three years; 15 will be in the project               for two full years; the remained all will be with the project for               at least a year. A four-stage model of teacher development which                supports gradual implementation of new ideas and movement toward                leadership, guides the project. Teachers in Stage Four will be                  involved in leadership activities within their own schools and                  locally. Mathematics content focus includes geometry,                           probability, and number theory. A series of \"urban vignettes\"                   that can be used as an inservice tools for professional                         development of urban mathematics teachers will be produced and                  published through the project.                                                                                                                                  Cost sharing is provided by the university and NYC school                       districts as 60% of the NSF award.",
