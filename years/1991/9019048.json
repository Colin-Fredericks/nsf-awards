 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to characterize the expression                and distribution of an excreted phosphate starvation inducible                  (epsi) acid phosphatase.  Specific prioritized goals of the                     proposal are: 1. To isolate cDNA and genomic clones of the epsi-                APase.  2. To characterize the regulation of epsi-APase mRNA during             induction by Pi starvation.  3. To study, via immunological                     methods, the expression and distribution of the epsi-APase in plant             cells and whole plants in the presence and absence of phosphate.                My laboratory has shown that, in tomato, phosphate starvation                   inducible (psi) metabolism involves changes in gene expression,                 protein synthesis, protein secretion, ion transport and biomass                 distribution.   Therefore, (psi) metabolism provides an excellent               system with which to study the interactive and pleiotropic                      regulatory events that govern the relationship between gene                     expression and metabolism.  One of the most dramatic psi responses              is the synthesis and secretion of a specific acid phosphatase                   (APase).  Cloning the epsi-APase gene(s) is an essential first step             towards understanding psi metabolism in higher plants.  We now have             all the experimental tools necessary to conduct the proposed                    research including methods for large scale isolation and                        purification of APase, several highly sensitive enzyme activity                 assays and cDNA libraries synthesized from message isolated from                cells at various stages of Pi starvation.                                                                                                                       Plants try to maintain a homeostatic cellular environment despite               great variations in the external environment.  One important aspect             of external variations is the availability of essential mineral                 nutrients in the soil.  In response to shortages of essential                   nutrients, plants respond in many ways both to reduce the demand                for such nutrients and to increase the capacity of the plant to                 scavenge nutrients from the environment.  It is of great interest               and importance to know how nutrient shortages are perceived and how             plants respond to alleviate the problem.  This proposal focuses on              how higher plants respond to shortages of the essential element                 phosphorous.  Results from this work will help us in understanding              how various responses to nutrient stress are initiated and                      coordinated.//",
