Such tests indicate stable                                     repetitive hysteretic behavior during numerous                                  load reversals such as may occur during a                                       severe earthquake.  The slip at a connection                                    occurs at a slip-critical shear force on the                                    bolts.  Therefore it is possible to accurately                                  design braces and other elements such that                                      they would not buckle or yield under forces                                     caused by a seismic event.  This would                                          eliminate the most undesirable behavior                                         occurring in conventionally designed steel                                      bracing.                                                                                                                                                        In this project the earlier studies will be                                     extended to a larger range of bolt sizes and                                    types of cyclic loading.  The behavior of                                       several bolts at a connection under cyclic                                      loading will also be investigated.  After                                       analysis of these results, a model test frame                                   for experiments on the table will be designed.                                  Practical design procedures for energy                                          dissipating connections and the range of their                                  applicability will be developed by testing the                                  frames with simulated earthquake loadings.  It                                  is expected that the proposed system utilizing                                  conventional fabrication procedures will be                                     exceptionally cost effective for practical                                      applications.",
