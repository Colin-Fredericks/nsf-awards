 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wasserman is using genetic, molecular, and biochemical                      techniques to define the intracellular signalling pathway that                  establishes dorsoventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo.                     Initially, he has focussed his interests on the molecular                       analysis of two genes, tube and pelle. A cDNA clone for tube has                been identified by its ability to direct in vitro synthesis of                  RNA that, upon microinjection, can phenotypically rescue embryos                lacking tube activity. A cDNA clone for pelle will be obtained by               a similar route. Patterns of gene expression and of post                        translational modification will be characterized as a means of                  exploring the mechanism of signal transduction. Deduced                         functional sites and domains in the tube and pelle proteins will                be disrupted by mutations engineered in the cDNA sequences;                     transcripts generated in vitro from the altered cDNAs will then                 be assayed for activity in the microinjection bioassay. Existing                or newly induced mutations for each gene will be used to generate               null allele combinations for phenotypic analysis. Lastly, gel                   filtration chromatography and immunoblotting will be used to look               for stable interactions that may define functional modules in the               signalling pathway.",
