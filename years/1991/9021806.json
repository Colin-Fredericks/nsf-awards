 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Kansas for the renovation and repair of Malott Hall               which houses the research and research training activities of the               Department of Chemistry.  This building was constructed in 1954                 and last renovated in 1980.  The ARFMP grant of $299,839 and                    $299,839 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to                modernize these research and training facilities so as to permit                an active research program to continue to increase in size as well              as in quality.  This project will address the need to improve the               current research infrastructure by converting a substantial amount              of the current research and research training space into additional             laboratory space and by attending to issues of handicap                         accessibility as well as to those of health and safety.  In                     addition to reconfiguring the space, the modifications will focus               on the addition of new fume hoods and the replacement of laboratory             furniture.                                                                                                                                                      This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of chemical                   research, much of which at the University of Kansas is at the                   important interface between bio-organic and inorganic chemistry,                and for the training of quality undergraduate, graduate, and                    postdoctoral students.  This renovation will ensure continued                   success for the University of Kansas in its placement of graduates              in academic institutions and in industrial and government                       laboratories.",
