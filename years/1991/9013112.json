 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organized collections of thunderstorms known as mesoscale                  convective systems have been identified as producers of most of                 the rainfall in the tropics and in mid-latitudes during the                     spring, summer and fall.                                                             The Principal Investigator will continue his research                      towards an improved understanding of mesoscale convective systems               (MCSs) and the atmospheric boundary layer.  Under previously NSF                sponsored research the Principal Investigator produced many                     significant new findings.  Among these are the identification of                the factors responsible for several distinctive features of MCSs.                    This line of research will continue with both observational                and numerical modeling components.  Emphasis will be placed on:                                                                                                 1.  The dynamics of a region of low pressure which often trails                 MCSs, known as \"wake lows\"                                                                                                                                      2.  The formation mechanisms of mesoscale vortices which form out               of MCSs.  These stable vortices are believed to be a triggering                 mechanism for future rounds of severe weather several hours after               the original MCS has dissipated.                                                                                                                                3.  The controlling factors for series of MCSs which are often                  responsible for severe rain events.                                                                                                                                  If successful, this research can be used to develop better                 numerical and conceptual models for the forecasting of severe MCS               weather events.",
