 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry will require a nitrogen laser and                   computer-interfaced UV/VIS spectrophotometer to improve their                   undergraduate education in chemistry.  The first part of this                   project will bring computers into the physical chemistry                        laboratory to give students experience in using                                 computer-interfaced instrumentation and to reduce the time                      required to analyze raw data.  It is hoped this will increase                   the appeal of this course to prospective chemistry majors and                   reduce a major barrier to their completing a B.S. major in                      chemistry.  The combination of computers with high-resolution                   plotters will also allow quantitative estimation of errors to                   be made much more quickly and more routinely. The computers                     will also be used with a molecular orbital program to interpret                 the absorption spectra of dyes and aromatic compounds and to                    teach the BASIC programming language.                                                                                                                           The new instrumentation will allow the introduction of three                    new experiments into the physical chemistry laboratory course                   as well as significant upgrading of several existing                            experiments.  The nitrogen laser will allow for measurement of                  fluorescence decay times in the 1 nanosecond range. Other new                   experiments include \"The Photochemistry of NO2\" and \"The                        Statistical Thermodynamics of Iodine Sublimation.\"",
