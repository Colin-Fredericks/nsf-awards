 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human dermal fibroblasts constitute a suitable system to                      study growth regulation.  These cells alternate between                         states of proliferation and quiescence under the control of                     growth factors, hormones, and extracellular matrix proteins                     elaborated by the fibroblasts.  Complex interconnected                          pathways transmit these extracellular signals to growth                         processes in the cell.  The objective of this proposal is to                    elucidate this signal transduction network.  A mutant cell                      type derived from benign dermal tumors, keloids, will be                        used to help unravel the regulatory network.  The keloid                        mutation modifies growth regulation by phorbol esters,                          prostaglandins and transforming growth factor beta,                             substances that may act as positive or negative effectors of                    growth.  Signal transduction pathways of these regulators                       are incompletely understood; however, several important                         intracellular messengers have been implicated.  Methods to                      be used include measurements of prostaglandin synthesis,                        prostaglandin receptors, and intracellular concentrations of                    cyclic AMP, Ca2+ and inositol phosphates after exposure of                      normal and keloid cells to effectors that differentially                        regulate DNA synthesis in these cell types.  The temporal                       pattern of signal transduction intermediates in normal and                      keloid cells should reveal the signalling pathways of these                     regulators and may clarify the complex interactions that                        coordinate and modulate growth-associated activities.                             Three minority graduate students will participate in the                      research with three researchers in the Microbiology                             Department at Meharry Medical College.",
