 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine biological invasions are pervasive, and an understanding                 of the processes and mechanisms of invasions is important to our                ability to manage and conserve marine resources.  Biological                    invasions are also large.scale experiments in ecology and                       evolution, providing unique opportunities to study basic                        ecological and genetic processes in the world' oceans, including                dispersal, recruitment, gene flow, and hybridization.  This                     project will examine the temporal and spatial pattern of spread                 of an introduced mussel, and the extent of genetic introgression                into populations of native mussels.                                                                                                                             This research will exploit the on.going incidental release of                   genetically distinct larvae of the exotic mussel, \u001aMytilus\u001a                     \u001agalloprovincialis\u001a, to study the invasion of a species with                    pelagic larvae.  \u001aM.\u001a \u001agalloprovincialis\u001a larvae are released into              San Francisco Bay on a daily basis in the ballast water of                      Japanese ships.  Our studies have shown that 4 x 10.6 mussel                    larvae may be released from a single ship.  Because San Francisco               is the only port in cent\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001aral California large enough to receive              ocean.going ships, all central California populations of \u001aMytilus\u001a              \u001agalloprovincialis\u001a likely stem from introduced population in San               Francisco Bay.                                                                                                                                                  The PI will develop  a set of primers (for mitochondrial and                    nuclear ribosomal genes) for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)                specific to invading Japanese \u001aM.\u001a \u001agalloprovincialis\u001a and to native            \u001aMytilus\u001a spp.  Using PCR as an assay, the PI will then establish               the distribution of Japanese \u001aM.\u001a \u001agalloprovincialis\u001a genotypes                 inside San Francisco Bay and in outlying bays and estuaries.                    This will elucidate intraregional patterns of dispersal of an                   invading species with pelagic larvae.  Further, because nuclear                 genotypes have 2 sets of chromosomes, assay by PCR will detect                  hybrid genotypes, revealing genetic introgression into native                   populations.  Combining mtDNA and nDNA analyses will allow                      detection of asymmetrical introgression.                                                                                                                        Until recently, the history of invasion by an exotic species                    could only be inferred from present day distribution, and little                inferred about the \u001arate\u001a of invasion.  However, because PCR allows             the amplification of DNA from preserved material, mussels                       collected (and preserved in museum collections) throughout the                  period of invasion on the North American west coast can analyzed                using the primers developed in this project.  In this way, it                   will be possible to reconstruct both the pattern and rate of                    invasion by \u001aM.\u001a \u001agalloprovincialis\u001a.                                                                                                                           This study, the first to apply molecular techniques to an ongoing               marine invasion, will provide new insights in the processes of                  dispersal and introgression of alien genotypes during a                         biological invasion.",
