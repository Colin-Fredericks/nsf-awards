 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pacific Science Association (PSA) is a non-governmental,                    multinational society dedicated to the study of scientific                      problems of particular pertinence to the Pacific region.  A                     major, on going activity of the PSA is to organize, every                       four years, a major Pacific Science Congress.  The Congress                     represents the major means through which the PSA meets its                      stated objective of promoting cooperation and communication                     in science and technology among the communities of the                          region.  The XVII Pacific Science Congress will be held in                      Honolulu from May 27 to June 2, 1991, the first time the                        Congress has met in the United States since 1961.  Titled                       \"Towards the Pacific Century: The Challenge of Change,\" the                     Congress will feature major symposia on such topics as global                   environmental change, biological diversity, health and social                   change, natural disasters, and technologies for development.                    In view of the profound economic and social changes currently                   in evidence throughout the Pacific region, and the interactions                 of science and technology with those changes, the Honolulu                      Congress is expected to be a highly significant event.  This                    grant will enable conference organizers to provide travel                       support to prominent scientists from the less developed                         countries of the region to participate in the Congress as                       invited speakers.",
