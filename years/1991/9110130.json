 "awd_abstract_narration": "People define themselves in part in terms of the groups or                      categories to which they belong, e.g. as women, attorneys,                      African-Americans, or parents.  These group memberships, or                     social identities, motivate people's behavior and influence the                 way they react to others.  Important distinctions exist among                   identities, however.  Two ways in which identities differ are:                  (1) whether an identity is ascribed, such as gender or ethnicity,               or achieved, such as an occupation or a parent role; and (2)                    whether the identity is enacted primarily in the private or in                  the public domain.  Six studies, using a combination of                         laboratory experiments and structured interviews, will explore                  the implications of these differences for self-evaluation, group                evaluation, and interaction with others.  The overall goal is to                understand how various forms of identity relate to each other and               what characteristics of group membership are important for what                 forms of social activity.",
