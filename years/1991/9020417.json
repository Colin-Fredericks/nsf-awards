 "awd_abstract_narration": "Practically all plants and animals show seasonal breeding,                 wherein young are produced at defined periods of the year.  Much                is known about the physiology that initiates seasonal                           reproduction, but relatively little is known about the ecological               forces that cause animals to restrict breeding to a particular                  time of the year.  It has long been assumed that animals time                   production of young so that they meet a favorable environment for               growth and survival.  Information on a wide variety of birds,                   however, suggest that young produced early in the season have                   substantially greater success than young produced later in the                  season.  This calls to question the traditional view that                       breeding seasons for birds are timed so that young hatch at the                 optimal time of the year.  In particular, why production of young               does not occur earlier in the season is of interest. This                       research is designed to answer that question by altering the date               of hatch in two colonial waterbirds, Herring Gulls and Forster's                Terns.  To interpret experiments that alter hatch dates, the                    effects of reduced incubation periods must be understood.                       Information on the influence of shortened incubation can be of                  immediate value to conservation biologists and managers working                 on threatened birds.  Colonial waterbirds are a particularly                    vulnerable group because coastal islands are one of their                       preferred nesting habitats, yet these are favored sites for human               recreation and development.  Egg manipulations that shorten                     incubation periods and reduce a vulnerable phase of the nesting                 cycle are one form of intensive management that have great                      potential for  increasing production from wild populations.",
