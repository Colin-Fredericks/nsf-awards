 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unification and matching are fundamental operations in many symbol-             manipulation systems such as automated deduction, rewriting and logic           programming.  In most applications involving unification and matching,          typically the same term is repeatedly unified either with several               other terms or with every subterm of these terms.  Moreover, very               often these match and unification attempts fail.  Existing methods are          inadequate for repeated unification/matching because either they are            inefficient or they make strong assumptions on the structure of the             input.  In addition, they do not handle failures properly.  The basic           issues involved in repeated matching and unification and the means to           design efficient algorithms for them will be addressed in this                  project.  Moreover, algorithms that can detect failures quickly will            be designed.  The practical importance of our algorithms will be                studied through a number experiments that will be conducted.  The               experiments will provide the best choice of algorithms which will be            used to build a rewrite system and to improve the SBProlog                      interpreter/compiler.  This research will yield new classes of                  algorithms for repeated matching and unification and also speed up              implementations of a large class of symbol-manipulation systems.",
