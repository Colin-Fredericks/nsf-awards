 "awd_abstract_narration": "These experiments will examine why some foods stimulate                         overeating (hyperphagia).  This research is based on the finding                that the addition of an artificial sweetener (saccharin) to high-               moisture foods stimulates long-term energy intake of laboratory                 rats.  Pre-exposing rats to either the unflavored food or                       saccharin in water blocks the ability of saccharin to increase                  energy intake; this is called the pre-exposure effect.                                                                                                          In all experiments, rats will either be pre-exposed or not pre-                 exposed to flavors and then fed test diets for several weeks.                   Test diets will contain either no added flavor, saccharin,                      monosodium glutamate, citric acid, or vanilla.  Experiments                     involving saccharin will determine whether or not rats learn                    relationships between the flavor of saccharin and subsequent                    absorption of food energy, whether or not experience with                       saccharin in food influences subsequent preference for saccharin,               and whether or not the pre-exposure effect persists over time.                                                                                                  The information obtained from these experiments should improve                  our understanding of how chemosensory stimuli influence energy                  intake and growth.  This, in turn, will be useful for developing                treatments that increase or decrease energy intake by humans and                domestic animals, as well as assist those developing improved                   foods and beverages.",
