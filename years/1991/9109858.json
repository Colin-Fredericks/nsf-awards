 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to develop highly                       efficient iterative algorithms for use in system design                         (especially communication systems) in the presence of non-Gaussian              disturbances, and to extend these algorithms to the design of                   systems which efficiently adapt to nonstationary environments.                       Analytic solutions to the design of systems with non-Gaussian              inputs are typically intractable, therefore numerical methods are               frequently required.  Stochastic approximation algorithms are                   effective design alternatives which require only estimates of the               system error at an iterated set of system parameters.                                This project merges concepts from Importance Sampling with                 existing stochastic approximation algorithms to dramatically                    reduce the total required computations in the design of                         parameterized systems and inputs.  In the situation where the                   inputs are non-stationary, a selfmodifying Importance Sampling                  strategy is developed for use with adaptive implementations of                  these algorithms.  This requires the coupling of techniques in                  estimation theory with Importance Sampling strategies derived from              static systems.  Example of particular interest are communication               systems operating in the presence of stationary and nonstationary               non-Gaussian background noise.  Preliminary results demonstrate                 that for the scalar design case, the computational savings are                  unbounded when designing detection systems whose error rates                    diminish.",
