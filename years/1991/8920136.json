 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the University of Southern California, in                    cooperation with the California Institute of Technology, the                    University of California, Los Angeles, the University of                        California, Santa Barbara, the University of California, San                    Diego, the University of California, Santa Cruz, Lamont-Doherty                 Geological Observatory of Columbia University, and the U.S.                     Geological Survey, requests funds to establish a Science and                    Technology Center entitled Southern California Earthquake Center.               The Science Director of the Center will be Professor Keiiti Aki                 and the Executive Director of the Center will be Professor Thomas               Henyey.                                                                                                                                                         The goal of the Center is to understand the physics of                          earthquakes, to develop a framework to integrate earthquake                     information of translation into hazard mitigation for societal                  benefit, to achieve a prototype application of a time-space                     dependent probabilistic hazard analysis for southern California,                and to characterize earthquake ruptures before their occurrence                 through numerical modeling of rupture, geological field mapping                 of fault geometry, subsurface imaging of three-dimensional fault                surfaces, and application of theoretical and statistical                        approaches to the physics of fault rupture.  The approach is                    keyed to the development of a Master Model, which is a framework                in which geologic, geodetic, geophysical, and seismological                     information pertinent to earthquakes in southern California will                be integrated for the purpose of developing a time-space                        dependent probabilistic hazard analysis of the region which may                 be used for predicting the levels of strong ground motions.                                                                                                     The Center's activities can be categorized into four major areas:               data base maintenance, modeling and model construction, model                   maintenance, and interpretation and use of the models.  Research                groups will be organized to develop each technical component of                 the Master Model.  Core activities include:  establishment of a                 data center for real-time seismic data acquisition, data                        archiving and distribution, and data retrieval service; fault-                  specific geophysical, geodetic, and geologic field studies;                     analysis of existing and new short-period network data to improve               the delineation of active faults; development of a physical model               of the earthquake process to establish a physical basis for the                 characteristic earthquake model; investigation of source, path,                 and site effects for strong ground motion prediction; regional                  tectonics, and commencement of a conceptual study for a pilot                   geotechnical project in an area prone to liquefaction and/or                    landsliding.                                                                                                                                                    Much of the industrialized world lives in earthquake prone                      regions such as the Pacific Rim and the Alpine-Himalayan belt.                  Earthquake belts generally provide the most hospitable climates                 and the greatest abundance of natural resources.  Thus, as                      population densities and concentrations of wealth grow in these                 areas, the earthquake risk increases.  Earthquake hazard                        mitigation is increasingly important to society - the 1989 Loma                 Prieta earthquake alone caused over $7 billion in damage and 66                 deaths.  Only through understanding the process can reliable                    forecasts be made of when and where potential destructive                       earthquakes may occur.                                                                                                                                          The Center will stimulate enhanced activity in precollege                       education and in the development of human resources.",
