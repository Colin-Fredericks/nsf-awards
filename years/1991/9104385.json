 "awd_abstract_narration": "Separation methods by which biological materials may be                         isolated with great sensitivity and in large scale, while                       remaining in a nondenaturing environment, are of substantial                    interest in a variety of scientific disciplines.  Consequently                  the technique of partitioning in two-phase aqueous polymer                      systems is frequently the method of choice for both research                    and commercial purifications of proteins, nucleic acids, and                    cells.  The great potential of the method and interest in it                    is revealed by the publication in recent years of three books                   and hundreds of papers on partitioning and by the commercial,                   large-scale application of partitioning by several major                        companies in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.  As a result of the                   rapidly expanding development of partitioning techniques,                       international conferences have been held biannually since                       1979.  The 7th International Conference on Partitioning in                      Aqueous Two-Phase Systems will be held in New Orleans, June 2-                  7, 1991.  This is the first time in over a decade for the                       meeting to be held in the United States and it is expected to                   attract a group of leading scientists of varied disciplines                     and backgrounds.  The Conference participants are typically                     involved in a variety of biotechnical separation in addition                    to partitioning, and as a consequence the Conference includes                   sessions on: novel and competing separation technologies,                       gravitational effects on separation and related processes,                      biotechnical applications of PEG chemistry, and polymer-                        protein and polymer-surface chemistry.  The grant is used for                   partial support of travel, registration, and per diem.  At                      least two other federal agencies (NASA and ONR) and several                     industrial companies also partial support of this conference.",
