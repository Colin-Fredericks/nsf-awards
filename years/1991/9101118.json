 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research project explores relationships between tree               species size, measured as the height at onset of reproduction,                  and leaf-level photosynthetic light response.  A positive                       relationship between adult tree size and maximal light-saturated                photosynthetic rate (Pmax) among primary rainforest trees is                    predicted.  This prediction derives from a general correlation                  across environments between light levels and maximum rate of                    photosynthesis, and the presence of a strong, predictable light                 gradient through the rainforest canopy.  Recent studies of                      physiological acclimation to sun and shade conditions suggest                   that photosynthetic acclimation is relatively limited in primary                tropical rainforest trees.  If this is so, Pmax values measured                 for saplings should be similar to Pmax values for adult trees,                  and the proposed allometric relationship should be detectable                   from photosynthetic measurements on saplings.                                                                                                                   Measurement will be made of maximal light-saturated                             photosynthetic rate (Pmax) for saplings of 35 species for which                 size and structural allometric data have been gathered.                         Differences in Pmax between saplings and mature trees of selected               species will be assessed.  Each genus included in the study spans               a wide size range, from understory treelets to canopy-level                     trees, making possible tests of phylogenetic differences.                                                                                                       This study represents the first attempt to examine photosynthetic               physiology of tropical rainforest trees in an allometric context.",
