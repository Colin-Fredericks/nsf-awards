 "awd_abstract_narration": "The organic carbon cycle will be studied at two open ocean                      sites which reflect potential differences in carbon derived                     from marine and terrestrial sources.  Studies of carbon                         isotopes and dissolved and particulate organic carbon will be                   conducted at Station \"M\" in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and in                  the Amazon River plume region of the Atlantic Ocean.  The                       control of DOC concentrations and . 14C values by natural                       microbial assemblages will also be evaluated.  Relationships                    between the different carbon pools, including sedimentary                       organic carbon (SOC), will be assessed at Station \"M\" during                    periods of high and low primary productivity and in a transect                  of Amazon River plume/Atlantic Ocean waters.                                                                                                                    The following questions will be addressed:  (1) Are carbon                      species and . 14C gradients a function of seasonal carbon flux                  rates in the open ocean?  (2) What is the contribution of                       terrestrially derived carbon species to the open ocean?  (3)                    Are isotopes activities fractionated with respect to particle                   size and/or organic composition?  (4) What fraction of the                      total DOC pool is potentially labile and truly refractory, and                  what are the . 14C signatures of each fraction?",
