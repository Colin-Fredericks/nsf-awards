 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through a phylogenetic analysis of a monophyletic species                     group of Blepharoneura (Diptera:  Tephritidae), sets of                         hypotheses are tested that address two major aspects: 1)                        evolution of host choice in phytophagous insects; 2) evolution                  of science and education.  This effort tests a new method for                   discovering morphological characters, utilizing public                          involvement, and stems from observations that untrained                         observers recognize patterns overlooked by specialists.                         Curious children are ideal untrained observers.  The                            investigator will work with teachers, visit classrooms, explain                 the research, and ask students for help (How can we tell these                  flies apart?).  The process generates new characters for the                    investigator, and involves students and teachers in the process                 of working on a real problem in science.  Methods and                           collaboration include:  field work in Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru,                 and Venezuela with volunteers from UMBC; isozyme                                electrophoresis; cytology; morphological character discovery                    with children and teachers in the elementary Science                            Integration Project, UMBC; and phylogenetic analysis.                             The study is significant because it will generate and                         integrate interactions between:  systematics and ecology, and                   science, education, and the public; and, provide a powerful                     model for these interactions.  The project furthers VPW program                 objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance their                  careers in science or engineering through research, and to                      encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas through                  the investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the                    host campuses.  In this project, the proposed activities which                  contribute to the second objective include:  working with and                   training elementary and middle school teachers and students,                    and involving them with research through the Elementary Science                 Integration Project (UMBC); training teachers and volunteers                    for field work using the National Aquarium resources;                           participating in two seminar series at UMBC; and serving as a                   lecturer for the University President's Commission on the                       Status of Women.",
