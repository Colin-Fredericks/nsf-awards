 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important processes in combustion is the                        formation and destruction of soot.  The concentration of soot                   controls the energy radiated by the flame and hence the flame                   temperature.  The effectiveness of soot destruction convrols                    the combustion efficiency and the environmental acceptability                   of the combustion device.  To provide an instrument for soot                    research, development, and eventually for process monitoring,                   this proposed project would develop a low cost (under                           $50,000), portable, versatile, non-intrusive flame diagnostic                   instrument having the following capabilities:  1) Measurement                   of spatially resolved mean value of both concentration and                      temperature of gas species and soot by tomographic                              reconstruction of line-of-sight Fourier Transform Infrared                      (FT-IR) emission and transmission (E/T) spectrographic data.                    2) Measurements of spatially resolved data on the time                          variations of species concentration and temperature.  The                       objective of Phase I is to develop and validate the method of                   FT-IR E/T tomography for flames being studied at the National                   Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) and General Motors                   for which data from other techniques are available.  These                      data would be used to help determine the mechanism for the                      formation and destruction of soot.  In Phase II, fiber optics                   and multi-plexing would be developed for obtaining multiple                     lines-of-sight simultaneously and the FT-IR turbulence                          measurements would be developed to allow spatially resolved                     data to be obtained.  Software and hardware would be developed                  for on-line, in-situ diagnostic instrumentation.                                                                                                                The successful completion of this program will result in a                      powerful, rugged instrument for in-situ diagnostics capable of                  measuring important properties of multi-phase reacting mefia                    either in research and development, in manufacturing or as a                    process monitor.  Applications include measurements in                          industrial gas turbines, industrial and residential furnaces,                   utility boilers, process heaters, jet engines and diesel                        engines.",
