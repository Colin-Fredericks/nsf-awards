Geotechnical centrifuges are used for                                experiments on earth structures.                                                                                                                                This international committee was formed in 1981, its                            purpose being: 1) to promote cooperation and the exchange                       of information on centrifuge testing and instrumentation; 2)                    to encourage the exploration of the potential of centrifuge                     testing in disaster reduction studies, in particular as a                       contribution to the International Decade of Natural Disaster                    Reduction (IDNDR); and 3) to organize an international                          conference approximately every 5 years.  The next                               conference is being held at the University of Colorado in                       Boulder, June 13-14, 1991.                                                                                                                                      This action is to provide partial support for the                               \"International Conference: Centrifuge 1991\" in Boulder,                         Colorado, June 13-14, 1991; as well as the activities of the                    committee in organizing this conference, and in planning the                    next series of regional and international conferences on                        centrifuge modeling.",
