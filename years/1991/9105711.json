 "awd_abstract_narration": "That type of anaerobic (or alternative) bacterial respiration                   called denitrification entails utilization of branched                          electron transport chains.  Nitrate is reduced to nitrite by                    electrons donated by reduced quinones to a b-type cytochrome                    subunit and thence to the molybdo-iron-sulfur subunit of                        nitrate reductase, a complex, membrane-bound enzyme conserved                   in all known denitrifiers.  Nitrite is reduced to nitric                        oxide by electrons passing from the cytochrome bc1 complex to                   cytochrome c551 and then to cytochrome cd1, the nitrite                         reductase conserved in 90% of denitrifying isolates.  The                       other apparent denitrifiers make use of a copper protein                        nitrite reductase that reduces nitrite to nitric oxide and                      appears in several cases tested not to link reduction to                        phosphorylation but to function as a nitrite detoxifier.                        Nitric oxide reductase, as integrally membrane-bound enzyme                     and reportedly very nearly purified in only two or there                        laboratories, appears to be a bc-type cytochrome.  Nitrous                      oxide reductase is an eight-copper protein conserved in                         several denitrifiers and reported in one case to have a c-                      type cytochrome subunit.  Ancillary enzymes (e.g., cytochrome                   c',superoxide dismutase, and cytochrome c peroxidase)                           apparently serve to protect this type of respiration from                       possibly damaging oxidants.                                                     To study the copper enzymes of Achromobacter cycloclastes,                      obtaining tertiary structures for cupredoxin and the N2O                        reductase, a Model of docking mechanisms for electron                           transfer among these copper enzymes will be developed.  Genes                   for the copper enzymes will be cloned in E. coli and site-                      directed mutagenesis will be used with the possibility of                       transfer of the genes into P. stutzeri mutants lacking                          nitrite and/or nitrous oxide reductase.  One goal will be                       reestablishment in vitro of the entire physiological electron                   transfer chain from pyridine nucleotide to terminal oxidant.                    Two unusual, perhaps unique, cytochromes that appear to bear                    ancillary roles in denitrification will be studied                              intensively.  These are, first, the high-spin-heme-bearing                      \"b'-type\" protein from B. halodenitrificans which reversibly                    binds nitric oxide; and, second, the cytochrome c-552 from                      anaerobically but not aerobically grown P. stutzeri Zobell                      strain, which undergoes alteration to become a cytochrome c                     peroxidase.  Investigation of the unusual properties of the                     B. haloldenitrificans nitrite reductase will be carried out                     to determine how the enzyme fits into the Gram + cell.  The                     mechanism for regulating the performance of D.  desulfuricans                   hexaheme as either nitrite or nitric oxide reductase will be                    investigated.",
