 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sputtered coatings of solid lubricating dichalcogenides such as                 molybdenum di       have received considerable attention,                       particularly due to vacuum and space applications.  Conventional                magnetron sputtered films of these materials on most surfaces                   have short sliding life.  A significant enhancement of durability               of these films under sliding can be attained by high energy ion                 irradiation of the sputter deposited films.  The objective of the               program will be to study and optimize the enhancement of sliding                life of sputtered dichalcogenides coatings on sapphire, M50 steel               and silicon nitride by high energy (MeV) light and heavy ion                    irradiations.  MeV ion irradiation is preferred over keV beams                  because of the current and potential use of films with                          thicknesses in the micron range.  The experimental program in                   Phase I is directed toward optimizing the conditions and gaining                understanding of sliding life enhancement of molybdenum dis                     coating on sapphire by MeV ion irradiations.  Both light (H+,                   He+) and heavy (Ni+, Ag+) ions at doses in the range of 1x1015 to               1x1016 cm_2 are used for this study.  The insight gained in Phase               I will be used in developing a Phase II program that will address               further optimization and potential applications.",
