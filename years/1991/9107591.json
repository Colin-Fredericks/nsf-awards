 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the problem of scheduling large job                 shops characterized by dynamic job arrivals, machine failures, due-             date related performance measures and different types of                        workcenters.  In spite of their practical importance, the                       difficulty of these problems has caused them to remain largely                  unstudied to date.  However, with the exploitation of special                   problem structures present in industrial contexts provides a                    promising approach.                                                                  An event classification approach to the dynamic aspects of the             problem is used.  It is combined with an approximation methodology              that can obtain near-optimal schedules for a static problem.                    Events affecting system state are monitored and those needing                   immediate attention (exceptions) are identified.  In the absence                of exceptions, schedules are generated periodically and implemented             on a rolling horizon basis.  If an exception occurs, the system is              rescheduled immediately.  An approximation methodology is proposed              to generate the schedules at the various rescheduling points.  This             requires the development of efficient scheduling procedures for                 different types of workcenters, leading to the formulation of a                 number of scheduling problems not extensively examined to date.                 The use of a specific industrial setting, that of semiconductor                 testing operations, as a research vehicle will enable the                       evaluation of the proposed research from a practical standpoint.",
