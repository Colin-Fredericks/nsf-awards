 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Herbig will continue his observational research into the nature             of diffuse interstellar bands.  It includes an effort to correlate              the strengths of the diffuse bands with local properties of the                 interstellar medium through high-precision observations of stars                imbedded in ionized hydrogen clouds, of stars behind clouds in                  which the coatings of the interstellar dust grains have to some                 extent been removed, and of stars behind shocked interstellar gas.              Dr. Herbig wil also search for interstellar polyatomic carbon                   molecules.  These studies depend upon the special advantages of                 observing from the high altitude site of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.                                                                                                   The problem of the identification of the carrier of the diffuse                 interstellar band (DIB) spectrum remains unsolved over fifty years              after it was demonstrated that these features are produced by some              constituent of the interstellar medium.  With the availability of               new detectors the list of diffuse interstellar bands has grown to               some 50 sure entries, to which can be added at least 20 more weak               features that have recently been found in the red and near infrared             regions of the spectrum.  Still no convincing regularities in DIB               characteristics are apparent.  This leads to the suspicion that a               family of carriers may be involved.  Dr. Herbig's research will                 address this very vexing problem in astronomy.",
