The research investigates relations between aggregate (community)               and family wealth, and husbands' share of family work.  While the               link between social wealth and family work has not previously                   been studied, PIs expect to find that husbands' shares will                     increase as family wealth increases.  The reason, investigators                 believe, is that as wives' resources increase, so does their                    power in the family, and hence, the amount of household work they               can expect from their spouses.  The research thus introduces ex-                change/power theories to demographic issues.",
