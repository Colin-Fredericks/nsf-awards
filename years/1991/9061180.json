 "awd_abstract_narration": "The large scale use of photovoltaic-generated electricity                       hinges on the cost if its production.  Thin film amorphous                      silicon is emerging as the next generation solar cell material                                                                                                  with commercial potential.  The progress in amorphous silicon                   technology has been rapid enough that it is presently at the                    manufacturing stage.  The commercial method for the production                                                                                                  of amorphous silicon is the glow discharge method, using                        silane as the feed-stock.  Photochemical methods are an                         alternate, potentially more cost efficient, method to prepare                   amorphous silicon.                                                                                                                                              This project is a systematic study of the photolysis of                         silanes in the condensed phase (\"ice\"), with a view to                          producing amorphous and polycrystalline silicon.  The emphasis                                                                                                  will be on adapting the condensed phase photolysis for the                      preparation of semiconductor grade amorphous and crystalline                    silicon, with the ultimate objective of scaling up the method                   to a manufacturing process for silicon solar cells.  The                        method has the advantage of easily incorporating any desired                    dopant by making the latter a co-condensate of the silane                       host.  It has the promise of gentler preparation conditions,                    compared to the glow-discharge method, thus producing a better                                                                                                  quality semiconductor.",
