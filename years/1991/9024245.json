 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This proposal supports the collaboration of                       Dr. Dwight Baker, Yale University, and Dr. Samira Mansour,                      Suez Canal University.  The overall purpose of this                             collaboration is to identify useful Frankia strain inocula                      that will improve growth and yield of Casuarina plantations                     in Egypt.  Much of the research will be conducted at the                        Suez Canal University in Ismailia, Egypt under the                              supervision of Dr. Samira Mansour.  Dr. Baker will assist in                    the design of the experiments in Egypt and travel to                            Ismailia for the set-up of screening trials.  At the                            conclusion of the trials in Egypt, Dr. Mansour will travel                      to Yale University and complete the DNA analyses in Dr.                         Baker's laboratory.                                                                                                                                             Scope:  This project brings together research scientists                        from two countries working on nitrogen-fixing trees                             (Casuarina) and bacterial symbionts (Frankia).  It is                           anticipated that this collaborative research effort will                        result in improved strains of Frankia that could enhance                        growth and yield of Casuarina.  This collaboration forms a                      valuable part of our emerging perceptions of Frankia                            biology.  Therefore, this project fulfills objectives of the                    Science in Developing Countries Program in its exchange and                     transfer of scientific knowledge through an international                       collaboration.",
