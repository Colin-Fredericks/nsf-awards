 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Physics is a vibrant area which deals with the                mathematical analysis of problems motivated by physics.  It has                 enriched many disciplines in Mathematics, and has made lasting                  contributions to various areas of Physics.  The Congress of the                 International Association of Mathematical Physics (IAMP) is a                   primary conference for Mathematical Physicists and is well attended             by participants from around the world.  It provides a unique                    opportunity for not only learning about the most recent advances in             the field, but also for engaging in detailed discussions about                  significant developments and open problems in related areas with                the world leaders in mathematical physics.                                           This travel grant will enable young American researchers to                attend the forthcoming IAMP Congress this summer in Leipzig,                    Germany.  Without funding these young scientists and graduate                   students would not be able to participate in this important                     Congress.",
