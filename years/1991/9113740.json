 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's prior work on an essential problem in geophysical                 fluid dynamics showed that a randomly turbulent mean flow can self-             organize into slowly varying zonal jets with flanking patches of                high-frequency smaller scale eddies (\"storm tracks\") under certain              conditions. The principal requirement is that the fluid contain                 vertical and horizontal shears of flow and temperature differences              that combine to provide a particular type of instability often                  found in real atmospheres and oceans. This realistic behaviour                  developed, and was maintained, in a model with a highly idealized               set of theoretical restrictions. His proposed strategy is to gene-              rate a small suite of less restricted, but still highly abstract,               models by judicious removal of carefully selected simplifications.              These would be chosen to illuminate the specific model properties               responsible for producing these realistic features as well as for               limiting their degree of verisimilitude when compared with                      planetary-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations. Another                   stated purpose is to test the robustness of the verisimilitude                  already achieved, and to demonstrate that this degree of realism is             not an artifact of the mathematical simplifications imposed in                  earlier models. Such stepwise building of basic understanding will              contribute to future advances in extended-range forecasting and                 climate modelling.",
