 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans instigate and respond to rapid changes in natural                   environmental conditions in a complex set of ways.  The process of soil         degradation, for example, traditionally has been studied largely in             natural and physical terms, with emphasis placed on the loss of soil            material, declining fertility, and changing vegetative sustainability.          Complete understanding of the process of soil degradation also involves         the study of human activity, however, because much of the loss and              deterioration of soils results directly from human activity.                    Furthermore, as soils degrade, agriculture and other human endeavors            must change.  This project examines not only those direct links among           human, natural, and physical systems; it also looks interactions one            step removed on order to determine how human and environmental forces           relate to each other.  The project will consist of a comparative study          of soil degradation in three districts of eastern Bolivia.  Soil                erosion will be estimated using direct measurements in sample plots and         through analysis of aerial photographs.  These photographs and field            observations also will be used to measure changes in land use, which            will be analyzed in conjunction with the soils data in order to                 evaluate associations between land-use change and soil erosion.                 Complementary analyses will integrate socio-economic data for the last          few decades and information gathered from interviews and oral histories         to assess social causes of practices that have promoted soil                    degradation and the degree to which soil degradation has become an              important political issue within Bolivia and in terms of its dealings           with other nations.                                                                  The results of this project will be valuable at a number of                levels.  Specific information gathered in the study area will increase          understandings of human-environmental interaction in this politically           volatile region.  The broader conceptual base within which this study           is set is global in nature, however, and the Bolivian conclusions will          complement results from related studies conducted elsewhere, thereby            enhance our broader knowledge of the human dimensions of global                 environmental change.",
