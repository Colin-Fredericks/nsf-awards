 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at the synthesis of structurally stereochemically             and topologically well-characterized vinyl polymers using                       principally anionic polymerization.  The synthesis of stereoregular             polymers involves the use of Lewis acid type and other additives                such as aluminum alkyls, lithium alkoxides and cuprates that show               promise in the stereoregulation process.  They will also explore                the polymerization of sterically hindered monomers with the aim of              a better understanding of the role of monomer conformation and                  carbanion geometry in the stereoregulation process.  They also                  anticipate that polymers of this type will exhibit interesting                  conformational properties including helicity.                                                                                                                   The second part of this research deals with the synthesis of                    macrocyclic homo- and block copolymers including well-characterized             macrocyclic polystyrene using capping methods designed to minimize              side reactions occurring at extremely low carbanion concentrations.                                                                                             These macrocyclic polymers will be characterized by several methods             including:  1H and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and the                 corresponding T1 relaxation measurements, Size Exclusion                        Chromatography (SEC), viscometry, and light scattering.                         Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements are of special             interest since they have shown that the molecular weight vs glass-              transition temperature profiles are completely different for linear             and cyclic poly(2-vinylpyridines).  Collaborative efforts with                  several investigators will center on structure-property                         relationships for physical properties such as melt viscosity and                electron microscopy.",
