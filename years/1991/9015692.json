 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Institutional Infrastructure award to Northeastern University is           for the development of a networked environment of powerful                      workstations and servers linking the College of Computer Science and            the Digital Signal Processing group in the College of Engineering.              The infrastructure supports research in a number of areas, many of              them collaborative.  CDMA for mobile communications involves several            activities including the design of pseudorandom sequences for                   minimizing communication interference, the design of efficient CPM              signals with trellis coding, and determining the fundamental limits on          the capacity of multiple user mobile channels.  Research on neural              nets involves both architectures for neural nets and learning                   algorithms.  Communication network research involves studying                   protocols for communications in high speed LANs and MANs, bridging              LANs, and packet radio networks.  Research on more mathematical                 topics includes computational algebra and algebraic models for                  compiler correctness.  Digital signal processing research involves              studies of hearing, high order spectra, image processing, adaptive              signal processing methods, and joint source coding theory.                      Signal processing is a natural collaborative area for computer                  scientists and electrical engineers.  The replacement of analog                 techniques by digital techniques requires a much more intensive use of          computation in order to interpret communications.  The research                 supported by this infrastructure grant includes work on how to make             local networks communications well amongst themselves and other                 networks, the development of new algorithms to get rid of noise and to          optimize the information carrying capacity of communications links,             the development of algorithms that will allow networks of computers to          work the same way as cellular phone networks, and more theoretical              work in studying the mathematical underpinnings of learning, algebra,           and compilers.",
