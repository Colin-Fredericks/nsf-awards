 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Staten Island Children's Museum requests support for                   an interactive exhibition for children on the topic of water.                   WATER WATER EVERYWHERE will open in April 1991 and remain on                    view for three years; a smaller replica of the exhibition will                  be ready to travel in the Spring of 1992.  The first year will                  allow an initial evaluation period during which both design and                 content can be improved.                                                                                                                                             The exhibition has dual goals: to provide family                           audiences, focusing on children, with the materials and context                 that encourage experimentation and learning, and to educate                     visitors about an essential and widespread constituent of our                   world.                                                                                                                                                               WATER will present different aspects of this varied                        subject in six sections: the many forms of water in our world;                  the properties of water; how living things use water; how water                 works for us; experiments with water and local water issues.                    The exhibition will engage children imaginatively, inform,                      provide opportunities to experiment and learn, and stimulate                    creativity.  Museum public programs and activities will be                      offered in conjunction with WATER to both extend and enrich the                 project.                                                                                                                                                             WATER will contribute to both children's and inter-                        generational learning.  Its desired outcomes include further                    development of the Museum's critical thinking skills program,                   expansion of our renewed Informal Science Education Program,                    extension of our community service programs and heightening our                 participation in community issues, such as the environment,                     through the ecological aspect of the exhibition.                                                                                                                     By touring the exhibition and producing educational                        materials based on WATER, the Museum will extend its impact in                  learning skills, science education and environmental awareness                  to a scale that is potentially national.",
