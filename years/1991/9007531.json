 "awd_abstract_narration": "Land plants are diverse and abundant components of the                     Devonian fossil record, but they are barely represented in                      Silurian rocks.  As a result, the emergence of plants onto dry                  land is poorly understood.  Spores and fragmentary macrofossils                 have been recovered from Silurian rocks in the Welsh Borderlands                and the northern Appalachians, but critical comparisons between                 these unique paleofloras have not yet been attempted.  Dr. Paul                 Strother proposes an intensive collecting effort in Pennsylvania,               followed by comparative analysis with Welsh material.  Dr.                      Strother will use infrared imaging to isolate and analyze the                   cuticular plant remains that have been preserved in shales.                          The proposed research has the potential to contribute                      important new fossils to our meager understanding of early land                 plants.  Dr. Strother's explorations and analysis will clarify                  the anatomy and ecology of these first land plants, and will help               to illuminate their evolutionary relationships to younger fossil                groups and to extant plants.  His results will find a wide                      audience among botanists, paleoecologists, and evolutionary                     biologists in general.",
