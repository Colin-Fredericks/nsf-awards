 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this project is the understanding of the                  hormonal regulation of steroidogenesis.  Steroid biosynthesis                   begins with the transport of the initial substrate, cholesterol,                from intracellular stores to the outer mitochondrial membranes.                 Following this process, the rate limiting step in steroidogenesis               occurs, which is transport of cholesterol from the outer to the                 inner mitochondrial membrane, where its metabolism to steroid                   hormones starts.  This investigator has identified an intrinsic                 outer mitochondrial membrane protein participating in mitochondrial             cholesterol transport.  This protein is known as the peripheral-                type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR).  An investigation of the                    mechanisms by which PBR regulates cholesterol transport in                      adrenocortical and testicular Leydig cells is proposed.  At first,              the hypothesis that PBR regulate the release or migration of the                outer mitochondrial membrane steroidogenic pool of cholesterol will             be examined using in vitro reconstitution experiments of                        mitochondrial membranes.  Electron microscope studies on the                    localization of the receptor will be performed.  The role of PBR                in hormone-stimulated steroid biosynthesis will be investigated.                Phosphorylation of PBR, identification of the protein kinase                    responsible for this, and its correlation with the function of PBR              will be examined.                                                                                                                                               This research is based on a novel finding that a receptor for                   certain neurotransmitter antagonists that had been known for their              effects on the nervous system is also found on the outer membranes              of mitochondria.  Preliminary results suggest that this receptor                is involved in regulating a key step in the regulation of steroid               hormone biogenesis.  The results of this research should elucidate              the role of this receptor in the physiologically important process              of steroid hormone production.",
