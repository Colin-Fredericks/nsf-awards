 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor D. Jaffe to work             in algebraic geometry.  He will work on curves and surfaces in                  complex projective three-space.  In particular, he will work on the             conjecture that a smooth connected curve, whose degree exceeds its              genus by at least four, is not an intersection of two surfaces.                      This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to              the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that              have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures defined               in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.                  Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from              analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in                 those fields.  Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as               diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography,                 coding theory and robotics.",
