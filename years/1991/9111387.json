 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemical senses are little understood in mammals and                        especially in humans, yet they are increasingly implicated in                   feeding, social, emotional, and sexual behavior, and even in                    disorders of these systems.  Yet it is hard to disentangle the                  genetic, developmental, and experiential factors underlying the                 role of the chemical senses in these behaviors.  Of all the                     amniote vertebrates, snakes rely on the chemical senses the most                in all phases of their behavior.  Because snakes are independent                at birth, the three kinds of factors can be readily studied.                                                                                                    In this research project, Dr. Burghardt will investigate the role               of genetics and dietary experience in the sensitivity of                        responses to food cues and food preferences, using litters of                   garter snakes and their mothers.  Young snakes will be tested                   with food odors of various concentrations as newborns and after                 being raised on a given diet.  Their ability to handle and ingest               the food represented by the odors will also be documented before                and after the dietary experience.  Questions this research should               answer include whether or not the sensitivity to normal prey                    odors is heritable, whether or not the ability to improve                       performance with feeding experience is heritable, whether or not                there is a relationship between perceptual and motor abilities in               feeding, and whether or not the variability among litters is                    greater than that within litters.  Answers to these questions in                animals from the same wild population should set lower limits to                the expected range of variation in animals with behavioral                      repertoires that are more complex but less dependent on the                     chemical senses.",
