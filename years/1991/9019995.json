 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to add advanced features to the                E. coli Genetic Stock Center database and to extend the current                 database to include additional genetic information currently                    available at the Center.  Special emphasis will be put on                       developing and handling representation, computation, and analysis               of mapping information; on the use and handling of pedigree data;               and on exploration of interaction and possible integrations with                other databases that specialize in information relevant to an E.                coli database.                                                                  The proposed work will involve extending the current design and the             current database and developing plans for integration with other                databases.  The design and structure of the current system were                 developed with these expanded functions in mind, so that the                    necessary additions can be accomplished without requiring that any              of the earlier work be discarded or redesigned.                                 This project is significant in                                                                                                                                       developing a database management system for a large strain                      collection involving complex genetic descriptions with as many                  as 20 genetic markers per strain;                                                                                                                               providing a means to query (in a database format) types and                     positions of mutations ranging from base pair changes in tRNA                   (suppressor) loci to insertion of transposons or sex factors                    between genes, to intragenic or intergenic deletions, to                        inversions, transpositions, or episome-integration of regions                   of the chromosome;                                                                                                                                              developing representations of uncertainties inherent in                         genetic data;                                                                                                                                                   providing retrieval capability for virtually any combination                    of genetic or strain traits, including specific mutation                        types, mutations in specific genes or within specific regions,                  plasmids with or without markers, and strain attributes such                    as sex or lab of origin; and                                                                                                                                    providing, in relational format, critical genome information                    at both the organismal and subcellular level, with capability                   of integration with sequence and other physical databases.                                                                                                 Much of the value of our approach to the mapping function lies in               the ability to store, analyze, and integrate data from many                     experimental sources as well as summary map data, and to have the               map data tied to our extensive and accurate database of genes,                  alleles, and strains.  This should facilitate detecting, for                    example, map anomalies that are strain specific, or allele-                     specific, or that consistently differ according to experimental                 procedure.",
