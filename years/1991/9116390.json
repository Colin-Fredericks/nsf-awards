 "awd_abstract_narration": "How did the universe, which apparently began with an almost                     perfectly uniformly expanding Big Bang, evolve into the present                 exceedingly complex and granular structure of galaxies, clusters                and superclusters of galaxies, and vast voids?  Theories to account             for this are best tested by observations of the changing clustering             of objects over exceedingly great distances and look back times                 toward the beginning.  Only quasars are bright enough to permit                 this, but they are too few in number to define the early structure.             Far more numerous absorbing objects exist between us and the                    distant quasars.  Using an existing multifiber spectrograph (to be              in the second year of the grant) and the McDonald Observatory 2.7 -             meter reflector to detect and analyze the redshifts of these                    absorbing clouds along lines of sight to the quasars, the                       clustering of large numbers of otherwise undectable high redshift               objects can be described, thereby directly studying the evolution               of large-scale structure in the universe.  The effects of ionizing              flux from quasars upon their local neutral hydrogen environment                 will also be measured, and the incidence will be determined.                                                                                                    This is the second part of a two part collaborative project.  Dr.               Smith has worked for many years in extragalactic studies.  Dr.                  Crotts, the co-investigator, is a leading young instrumentalist.",
