 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paralogs are short polymer analogs of antibody binding sites                    (paratopes) used as chromatography ligands.  Like antibodies,                   they provide a mixture of binding modes at the molecular                        dimensions of analytes.  The Phase I work by Terrapin                           Technologies established that these ligands provide a useful set                of novel sorbents for separating proteins.  The proposed work                   encompasses two extensions of the Phase I work.  First, selected                non-standard amino acids will be incorporated to increase the                   specificity of the resulting paralog families for particular                    classes of proteins, such as glycoproteins.  Second, in order to                achieve higher resolution for separating small molecules, such as               peptides, suitable chemical modifications of the paralogs will be               developed for attaching the ligands to HPLC compatible sorbents.                                                                                                Both projects address fundamental questions raised by the success               of the initial work on paralog affinity chromatography, and both                lead to new products with widespread utility in research,                       medical, and industrial applications.                                                                                                                           It is anticipated that Terrapon's ligands will be used as                       chromatographic media by research biochemists purifying novel                   proteins, by pharmaceutical manufacturers purifying proteins on a               preparative scale, and by Quality Assurance laboratories                        assessing the purity of therapeutic proteins.",
