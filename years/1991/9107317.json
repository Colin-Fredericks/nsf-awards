 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                 the Chemistry Division, Professor Dykstra will develop a                        comprehensive model suitable for the rapid evaluation of weak                   interaction potentials between large molecules and molecular                    clusters. These potentials will be employed within a molecular                  mechanics framework to calculate the effects of these weak                      interactions on intrinisic molecular properties, particularly                   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters. The goal is to                     improve the value of certain NMR  data and other spectroscopic                  data for structure elucidation in complex and extended                          molecular systems, including proteins and other biomolecules.                   The NMR parameters (e.g., shielding tensors, spin-spin coupling                 tensors, etc.) will be calculated analytically for                              representitive small molecules using ab-initio techniques                       developed by Professor Dykstra. High level electronic structure                 calculations will be employed to characterize local                             polarization response of molecules to external electrical                       properties, and then to evaluate the modeling of distributed                    electrical responses in spatially extended molecules. The                       treatment of polarization will be the key problem in achieving                  a realistic model of large systems. Ab-initio calculations will                 also be employed to benchmark cooperative effects, since these                  are important for any model applicable to large clusters.                                                                                                       Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the                     most valuable tools available for the elucidation of the                        structures of molecules, particularly for molecules in                          solutions. The results of this project are expected to improve                  the utility of NMR and other spectroscopic data in the                          determination of structures of large biomolecules.",
