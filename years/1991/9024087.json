 "awd_abstract_narration": "A robotic control system for automated container ship                           loading will be developed and tested in a computer                              simulation of the container loading process.  The key                           innovation is the combination of efficient feedforward                          control laws with a linear feedback based on both                               container and ship states.  The sensor system is an                             extension of the ship-tracking sensor suite developed in                        Phase I.                                                                        As demonstrated in Phase I, the technical problems                              associated with automation are (1) determining the                              precise position of the ship at the time of loading, (2)                        damping the pendulum motion of the suspended                                    container, and (3) compensating for the flexibility of                          the crane and cables.  The Phase II research will                               develop a ship/container sensor system, derive                                  mathematical models of system components, develop a                             control law, build and validate a computer model, and                           use it to verify the control system performance.                                The system can be retrofitted to existing cranes with                           suitable crane controls and mechanical sway damping,                            providing tremendous improvement and savings at a                               relatively small cost.  In Phase III a prototype working                        system on a ship load crane will be built, in cooperation                       with a consortium of major U.S. shipping lines and port                         authorities.",
