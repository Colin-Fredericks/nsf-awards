 "awd_abstract_narration": "Detecting the occurrence of an underlying change in a process, when             observations are only related probabilistically to the state of the             process, has long been a problem of concern to statisticians,                   engineers, economists, epidemiologists, etc.  In this proposal, we              use the context of machine monitoring, although applications to                 areas such as quality control, health, military surveillance or                 economic analysis should be readily appparent.  We propose to                   address four issues that are relatively neglected both in the                   literature and in practice:                                                     (1) Rather then focusing on the expected time until the first false             alarm is raised, given the system remains `in control', we propose              the use of the more practical concept of `false alarm rate', the                expected number of false alarms per unit time during the entire                 monitoring process.                                                             (2) Rather than focusing on the expected time to detect the system              as out of control, given it is out of control, we focus on the                  expected time between when the system goes out of control and when              it is detected as out of control in the course of the monitoring                policy.                                                                         (3) We propose to investigate various exact and approximate ways                to compute system operating characteristics.                                    (4) We propose to examine the sensitivity of operating                          characteristics to changes in expected time between system failure,             relative discriminatory power of sampling devices and the existence             of natural times at which to monitor and take actions.",
