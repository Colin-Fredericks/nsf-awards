 "awd_abstract_narration": "Present-day environmental fluid flow problems are routinely                     concerned with making predictions over large space and time                     scales in systems with sparse field data.  The classical approach               identifies characteristic length and time scales as a means of                  resolving the basic forces or fluxes driving fluid circulation.                 In a study of the hydrology of closed basins, Duffy and Al-Hassan               (1988) applied the concept of scale invariant topography to                     construct an empirical topographic distribution for the range                   bordering the Pilot Valley Playa in western Utah.  Regional                     correlation of mean precipitation with altitude was used to                     construct scaled inputs for modeling mountain-front recharge.  At               the playa or ephemeral lake, high evaporation rates were observed               to produce concentrated brines in the shallow groundwater,                      resulting in unstable stratification and the potential for free                 convection.  These observations guided numerical experiments                    conducted over a range of closed -basin geometries, and led to                  the development of a force or flux balance for subsurface                       circulation driven by mountain precipitation and playa-lake                     evaporation.  The results suggest that the playa margin becomes                 a critical hyhdrologic zone where upwelling groundwaters from                   mountain-front recharge (forced convection) and brine                           recirculation from the central playa (free convection) converge,                producing fresh and/or brackish springs.  The premise of this                   work is that the position of the freshwater-saltwater interface                 represents a balance of hydro-climatic forces in the basin.                     Using characteristic lengths and velocities of the closed basin,                the Rayleigh number for salinity was shown to be linearly related               to a dimensionless group representing the steady-state position                 of the interface.  The proposed research will attempt to extend                 previous numerical experiments to include complexities of space                 and time variability, namely: (1) the dynamic response of                       subsurface convection resulting from transient fluctuations in                  mountain recharge and playa evaporation; (2) the implications of                deterministic and stochastic heterogeneity to the estimation of                 effective basin parameters; (3) regional flow from multiple-                    cascading basins of varying base level; (4) the role of surficial               hydrologic processes (runoff); and (5) the significance of                      unsaturated flow and the atmosphere-land surface boundary                       condition.",
