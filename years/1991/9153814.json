 "awd_abstract_narration": "San Diego State University Foundation will conduct a five-                      year program to enhance 225 mathematics teachers of grades 4                    through 8 who teach in schools with large African-American                      and Latino enrollments.  Each teacher will participate in                       one of four two-year cycles (180 hours) of Saturday                             workshops during the academic year, a two-week summer                           workshop, and working with students and parents in after                        school activities.  Participants will 1) study mathematics                      content, research on teaching and learning mathematics, and                     methodologies and curricula; 2) participate in an after-                        school mathematics laboratory program for children; and 3)                      assist in implementing workshops designed to involve parents                    in their children's mathematics education.  Mathematical                        content will include number, patterns and functions,                            algebra, statistics, probability, geometry, and measurement.                    The project design also calls for the study of the longer-                      term effect of the enhancement.                                                 San Diego State University's  Cost-sharing accounts for 17%                     of the NSF budget.                                                                                                                                              This proposal is well-conceived and has the potential for                       becoming an exemplary model for the enhancement of teachers                     working in schools with high African-American and Latino                        populations.",
