 "awd_abstract_narration": "So far, there is no definitive proof of a causal connection                between sunspot cycle and the Earth's climate, but a large                      collection of suggestive correlations and circumstantial                        evidence have been compiled.  The recent discovery of the                       positive correlation between the level of solar activity and the                total solar irradiance over a solar cycle provided a physical                   ground for an activity-climate relationship.  During a solar                    cycle, the total solar output varies but the measured change is                 relatively small, but it is legitimate to expect that during the                prolonged period of low solar activity, the solar output may drop               substantially.  This makes the association of a Maunder-Minimum-                like event (low sunspot numbers for several decades) to a cooler                climate more plausible.  An important question relating to the                  study of causal connections between the sun and Earth is: What is               the basic mechanism that connects the solar activities to the                   variation of solar output?  This study aims at eventually                       answering this question.  Presently, there are two steps to take:               (i) to develop a solar differential rotation model which agrees                 with the results of helioseismology; (ii) to relate the temporal                variation of the solar differential rotation with the change in                 conditions of the convection zone.  The first step is a                         prerequisite for understanding the solar dynamo which is the                    basis of solar activities.  The second step explores the                        application of the knowledge of differential rotation to                        diagnosing changes of the solar interior.  A combination of                     analytical and numerical techniques will be used to accomplish                  these tasks. ***",
