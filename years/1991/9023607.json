The                                               particular device under                                                         investigation is the polySilicon                                                gate-blocking Oxide-silicon Nitride-                                            tunnel Oxide-Silicon (SONOS) multi-                                             dielectric microstructure.  The                                                 traps are located in the silicon                                                nitride and this research explores                                              the physical mechanisms by which                                                charge injection, transport and                                                 storage is accomplished in 'scale'                                              device structures.  The origin and                                              control of these traps is an                                                    important objective in the program                                              as well as the examination of                                                   electron and hole transport across                                              interfacial boundaries with novel                                               charge-separation techniques.  In                                               particular, we propose to                                                       investigate a new SONOS device                                                  structure which uses a polysilicon                                              storage region for increased charge                                             storage at low programming                                                      voltages.  These SONOS structures                                               show great promise for low voltage                                              programming and the results of this                                             research will impact such areas as                                              high density, nonvolatile memories,                                             application specific integrated                                                 circuits, wafer scale integration                                               and neural networks.  In particular,                                            the low power, electrically                                                     reprogrammable SONOS analog                                                     conductance is an attractive                                                    'modifiable' synapse for neural                                                 network implementation.",
