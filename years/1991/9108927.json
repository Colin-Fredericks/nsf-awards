 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital controllers are commonly designed for                                   continuous-time systems.  When the underlying system                            is significantly time varying, it is expected that so                           should be the controller.  Often (as is the case with                           locally linearized models of nonlinear systems with fast                        changing operation regimes, or in adaptive                                      implementations), long term values of the system                                parameters are not available.  The purpose of the                               proposed research is to develop a design methodology                            that will address these issues: to look for a robust                            digital design that takes into account, indeed, that will                       optimize the continuous-time system behavior.  That                             will be in contrast to most current designs which focus                         solely on the sample-time closed-loop evolution.  The                           design methodology should be suitable for time-varying                          systems and require only (temporally) local numerical                           values of the system parameters.  H-infinity, Graph and                         Gap control theory will provide the underlying                                  paradigms.                                                                      The immediate goals set forth in this proposal touch on                         issues at the focal point of current systems research,                          and are significant in realistic applications.  The                             objectives will also give rise to several fundamental                           technical and conceptual questions: The closed-loop                             system evolves in hybrid-time (continuous and                                   discrete).  An appropriate framework for hybrid-time                            H-infinity analysis and optimization will have to be                            developed.  The treatment of time-varying systems                               rules out direct use of transform domain techniques.                            This study is thus intended to follow and attempt to                            further extend the recent alternative path of a                                 variational/game theoretical time domain approach to                            H-infinity design.  It will also attempt to bridge the gap                      between this time domain approach and the standard                              operator theoretic/factorization based transform                                domain H-infinity analysis.  Finally, reliance on                               temporally local models will require an adaptation the                          1970's LQ \"receding horizon\" approach to the H-infinity                         framework, and the study of appropriate concepts of                             \"slowly varying systems\" that will give criteria to the                         success of \"frozen time\" based on receding horizon                              design.",
