 "awd_abstract_narration": "While it is clear that cells maintain a cytoplasmic free magnesium              level well below the magnesium equilibrium potential and require                magnesium ion for the normal activity of many enzymes, the role of              intracellular magnesium in regulatory events in cellular physiology             remains largely unexplored.  Attempts to study mechanisms that                  regulate intracellular magnesium levels and to assess the                       physiological role of this cation have been limited by the lack of              adequate techniques for measurement of intracellular free                       magnesium.  The development of magnesium-sensitive fluorescent                  indicators that can be loaded into cells has made it possible to                monitor intracellular magnesium on a second by second basis for the             first time.  Having established a technique for utilizing one of                these new indicators, Mag-fura2, to measure internal magnesium in               BC3H-1 cells, the primary goals of this proposal are: 1) to                     characterize the kinetic relationship between intracellular                     magnesium and ATP/creatine phosphate levels in BC3H-1 cells, 2) to              develop a technique for determining the magnesium buffer capacity               of these cells, and 3) to characterize the effect of acute exposure             to epidermal growth factor and other growth factors on ATP levels               in BC3H-1 and Swiss 3T3 cells.                                                                                                                                  Since cells maintain their intracellular magnesium levels within                certain limits, and require magnesium for the regulation of a                   variety of critical cellular functions, it seems likely that                    regulation of intracellular magnesium is a physiologically                      important process.  Recent advances in the development of                       fluorescent probes for magnesium ion now make it possible to                    approach this problem.  The proposed research will take advantage               of these new research tools to provide fundamental new information              about the intracellular regulation of magnesium, the most abundant              cation found in mammalian cells.",
