 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, noncooperative game theory, and especially Nash                equilibrium analysis, has been used in the study of many economic               situations.  Along with the many and varied applications has come               persistent criticism:     Why or when is equilibrium analysis                   appropriate?  Where do equilibria come from?  How does one choose               among many equilibria in making predictions?  This project                      addresses these questions using two different approaches.  In the               first, players are assumed to follow ad-hoc behavioral rules in the             spirit of models of bounded rationality.  In the second, the                    players' forecasts and behavior are obtained as the solution to a               dynamic optimization problem given their exogenous prior beliefs                about the opponents' strategies.  A common theme to both parts is               that learning need not lead to a Nash equilibrium even when players             are long-lived, unless they also engage in a sufficient amount of               experimentation.                                                                                                                                                The learning-based justification of equilibrium analysis developed              in this project is a very significant contribution.  It provides                a better foundation for widely-used analytic tools, identifies new              and promising lines of research in economic theory and motivates                research in economic theory with the tests of existing theories in              experimental economics.//",
