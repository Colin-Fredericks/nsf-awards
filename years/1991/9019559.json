 "awd_abstract_narration": "The final goal of the research is to establish spectrophotometric               pH measurements as a key analysis in the study of the oceanic                   carbon dioxide system.  The bulk of the work will be focussed on                calibrating the dyes for use as pH indicators by direct reference               to measurements using the highly reproducible hydrogen/silver-                  silver chloride cell.  Additional work will be performed to                     assess the stability of the indicator dyes and the importance of                impurities in commercially available chemicals.  Experiments will               also be conducted to demonstrate that these pH measurements of                  dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and f(CO2).                       Furthermore, an additional pH buffer for use in the electrometric               measurement of oceanic pH, will be established.  Detailed and                   precise pH profiles will be obtained in the North Pacific Ocean                 in conjunction with the CO2 system measurements of NOAA                         personnel.  The proposed work entails measurements of                           spectrophotometric pH on each seawater sample analyzed by NOAA                  personnel for total inorganic carbon, CO2 partial pressure, and                 total alkalinity.  These measurements will be used to assist in                 long term NOAA investigations of oceanic-atmospheric CO2 exchange               and will also be used to verify the accuracy of pH determinations               involving in alkalinity, total CO2, pCO2 and pH data sets.",
