 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Lim is supported by a grant from the Experimental                  Physical Chemistry Program to study the structure and spectra                   of van der Waals dimers, excimers, and bicimers (doubly                         excited) of aromatic hydrocarbons for the purpose of deducing                   the dependence of the structure on the nature of the electronic                 state.  Experimental techniques will include time- and                          energy-resolved spectra in absorption and/or emission. A                        comparison of these intermolecular dimers with the                              corresponding diaryl alkanes which are their intramolecular                     dimer counterparts will provide spectral and temporal                           characteristics from which can be deduced structural features                   and energetics of vibronic transitions for the three classes of                 molecular dimers.  Theoretical studies of the two interacting                   molecules as a function of their relative orientation will be                   combined with the experimental studies for a detailed                           characterization of these species.                                              %%%                                                                             The combination of experimental and theoretical approaches is                   expected to lead to an understanding of the dependence of the                   structure of the dimers on the nature of the electronic state                   of the hydrocarbon and contribute to our understanding of                       energy flow in these systems and the intermolecular forces that                 hold the pair of molecules together.",
