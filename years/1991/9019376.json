 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years environmental concerns about anthropogenic                 perturbations to the earth's middle atmosphere have led to the                  development of many radiative photochemical-dynamical coupled                   models to study basic chemical and physical processes and their                 long term effects.  This grant aims to develop an improved                      computer model of infrared  radiative cooling/heating based on                  recent research by the principal investigator.  Research on                     radiative damping in the middle atmosphere  will be performed to                investigate its importance in wave mean-flow interactions.                      Related work will focus on improving our understanding of gravity               wave saturation by studying gravity waves radiating from a region               of wave forcing in the vicinity of a critical level through                     geostrophic adjustment or instability.  Finally, an effort will                 be made to understand why ground-based microwave measurements of                mesospheric H2O seasonal concentration variation inconsistent                   with SME derived semiannual variations of 03.  The H                            measurements show very large semiannual variations which are                    consistent with SME derived semiannual variations of 03 densities               at 80km, while the inferred O concentrations at 80 km show a                    predominantly annual variation well correlated with the H2O                     measurements but, on the basis of current photochemical theory,                 inconsistent with the seasonal H 03 density variation.",
