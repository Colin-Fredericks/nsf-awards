 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant cell elongation is an expression of metabolic changes that                alter load bearing bonds within the wall to allow molecular                     displacement under the influence of internal pressures.                         Specifically, the proposal addresses the hypothesis that specific               wall polysaccharide structures are modified in such a manner that               such load bearing bonds are affected.  The assay system utilized                will be the Zea mays coleoptile.  The major directions the proposal             explores include: 1) The development of an in vitro system to                   quantitatively evaluate polysaccharide binding to cellulose.  This              model will allow a determination of the extent to which binding is              affected by pH and the effect of pH after modification of                       structures by enzymes.  2) The experiments will extend the                      observation that antibodies are powerful probes to explore cell                 wall metabolism.  The results derived from application of a family              of glucan and glucanase antibodies will be extended to determine                the consequences of exposure of tissue to glucuronoarabinoxylan                 antibodies.  The behavior of ferulic acid and the role of diferulic             acid linked to these molecules will be assessed.  3) An important               component of (2) will be the application of a new enzyme mechanism,             using glucuronoxylanase (previously called feraxanase), to modify               glucuronoarabinoxylans to determine structure (especially                       glucuronic acid and ferulic acid components).  A second emphasis                is based on the observation that spatial (directional) application              of antibodies is important in their capacity to suppress growth.                This effort will help to determine the role of the epidermis in                 controlling elongation.  Structural and metabolic aspects will also             be examined in isolated epidermal cell walls.  The experiments                  described in this proposal will help to elucidate the molecular                 mechanism of plant growth.//",
