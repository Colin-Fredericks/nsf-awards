 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support continued collaborative research in                     nuclear physics between Dr. David Fossan, State University                      of New York at Stony Brook, and Drs. R. Wadsworth and P.J.                      Nolan, University of York, England.  The objective of the                       project is to carry out nuclear structure studies in the                        A=130 region.                                                                                                                                                   The investigators will carry out gamma-ray experiments to                       study high spin rates in the mass 130 region, using the UK                      Science and Engineering Research Council's research laboratory                  at Daresbury.  The unique facilities at Daresbury, the 22MV                     tandem accelerator coupled with the large TESSA gamma-ray                       array and the recoil mass spectrometer, have specific                           advantages for the proposed research, such as in statistical                    sensitivity and identification. Complimentary spectroscopy                      experiments will be carried out at the Stony Brook tandem-                      injected superconducting LINAC facility.  Collaboration will                    take place out at both laboratories using several experimental                  approaches to optimize the sensitivity to important nuclear                     structure information.  Analysis and interpretation of these                    different experiments will be jointly examined.",
