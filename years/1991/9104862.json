 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the acquisition of a vertical seismic                profile integrated with a high-resolution reflection survey which               will provide both wide- and narrow-angle reflections from the                   climatic cyclostratigraphy recorded in the Triassic sediments of                the Newark Rift Basin, New Jersey.  The small amount of                         stratigraphic overlap between the core holes of the Newark Basin                Scientific Drilling Project further justifies the use of high                   resolution seismic profiling to effectively tie single formations               from one hole to another.  The best manifestation of the                        cyclostratigraphy occurs within the Lockatong and lower Passaic                 formations.  Each will be sampled by only a single core hole, the               holes near Titusville and Pennington of Lamont's southern                       transect in Mercer County, New Jersey.  To trace facies                         variations amounting to changes in reflectivity and interval                    velocity between core holes requires the detailed velocity                      information and high resolution subsurface images that can be                   provided by VSP and high resolution surface seismic surveys.  The               velocities and reflectivities recorded by these surveys should                  correlate with lake depth index variations can be traced between                core holes using the high resolution surface seismic surveys to                 evaluate the continuity of sequences between the core holes as                  well as changes in composite Van Houten cycle spacing and lake                  depth index with proximity to the eastern shore of the basin.                   Such controls will provide additional constraints for                           interpretation of the core data with respect to basin wide                      cyclicity.",
