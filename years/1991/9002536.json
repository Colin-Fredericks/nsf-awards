 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry                   Division and the Polymers Program of the Division of Materials                  Research supports the continuing work of Professor Green and Dr.                Levon at the Polytechnic University. The results of this research               will give new understanding and insight to the right or left hand               helical nature of polymers. The factors that control the                        preferential formation of right- or left- handed helices will be                explored. Since bio-polymers, such as peptides and DNA, can exist               in right- or left- handed helices, this work is of particular                   interest.                                                                                                                                                       Drs. Green and Levon will provide new and important information in              three areas, of which all are related to how the chirality of the               monomers effect the helical chirality of the polymers. In the                   first area, the effect of a chiral center on the chiral helicity                of isocyanate polymers will be studied. It has been found that a                chiral center by virtue of deuterium substitution in R-1-                       deuteriohexylisocyanate had a profound effect on the helical                    chirality of the polyisocyanate. This observation will be studied               further as well as the helical chirality of the polymer resulting               from R-2-deuteriohexylisocyanate. In the second area, a study will              be made of the relationship between helical twist of a side chain               containing a biphenyl group in an N-carboxyanhydride monomer and                helicity of the polyglutamate polymer. In the third area, the                   gelation of polyisocyanides as function of the stereochemistry of               the monomer will be investigated.",
