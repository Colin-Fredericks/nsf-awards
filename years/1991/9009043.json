 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to comprehensively examine and                  critically assess Friedrich von Hayek's contribution to                         methodology in economics.  Hayek is a Nobel Prize winner and a                  leader of the Austrian Economics movement.  He has written                      extensively about social science methodology, but no                            comprehensive analysis or assessment of his contribution exists.                Of particular interest are the origins of Hayek's views, how he                 justified them, and the internal consistency of his                             methodological approach.  The relationship between Hayek's ideas                on methodology and those of a number of other twentieth century                 economists and philosophers will also be examined.  The positions               of Ludwig von Mises, Karl Popper, and Milton Friedman will                      receive extended attention.  The primary method of research will                be a through review of the written work of Hayek and of related                 authors.  Nearly five hundred pages of transcripts from                         interviews of Hayek held during the late 1970's will also be                    analyzed.  This research will be of value to scholars interested                in the methodology of economics and in the history of economic                  doctrine, and more broadly to the philosophers and historians of                science.",
