A                         comprehensive system, where a multi-axis Computer Numeric Control               (CNC) Machining Center is to be used to perform all the operations              from rough milling to final grinding and polishing of molds and                 dies, is to be developed. This is based on an unified system of                 tool path planning and generation from an initial data base of bi-              cubic surface patch description. This approach will aim to provide              a means to automatically generate final grinding, polishing and in-             process surface roughness inspection toolpaths, directly from a                 three dimensional surface or solid computer model thus avoiding the             need to build a physical model.                                                      Many industrial products are manufactured by processes that                utilize dies and molds. These are currently manufactured by manual              techniques that are time consuming, labor intensive and expensive.              This research will attempt to automate this process thus improving              the productivity and competitive ability of the manufacturing                   sector.",
