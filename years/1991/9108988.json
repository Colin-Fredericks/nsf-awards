 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant succession may be initiated by patch formation by the                pioneer plants.  This research will consist of a series of                      experiments to determine whether the formation of these patches                 is related to mycorrhizal colonization on recently deglaciated                  till.  Initial colonization by individual plants may be                         controlled by abiotic factors such as microsites for seed                       deposition and water catchment, while later patch formation may                 be regulated by both abiotic and biotic factors.  These biotic                  factors are the focus of this study.  The initial colonizing                    plant may act as a \"nurse \" plant both by ameliorating the                      microenvironment and by providing a source of mycorrhizal                       inoculum for later colonists.  The investigators hypothesize that               the initial colonizers in boreal Alaska are facultatively                       mycorrhizal, and that they can survive in glacial till without                  mycorrhizae until inoculum is naturally dispersed.  The next wave               of plant colonists may be facultatively or obligately                           mycorrhizal, and they may establish more rapidly if their seeds                 are deposited near a nurse plant.  Thus patch formation in the                  initial stages of glacial succession in Alaska may depend on                    mycorrhizal fungi.                                                                   Experiments will consist of planting both vesicular-                       arbuscular (VA) and ectomycorrhizal inoculated and uninoculated                 nurse plants on glacial till, planting uninoculated seedlings                   around the nurse plant, and observing natural plant and                         mycorrhizal colonization.  The effects of microenvironmental                    amelioration by the nurse plants versus mycorrhizal inoculation                 can be separated by comparing plant growth near and at a distance               from inoculated versus uninoculated nurse plants.  The                          physiological response of the individual plants to mycorrhizae                  will be measured under controlled conditions.  Many early to mid-               seral plants have been reported to be both VA and ectomycorrhizal               during succession on glacial till, and both types of fungi will                 be manipulated and observed.",
