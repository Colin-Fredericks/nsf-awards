 "awd_abstract_narration": "The teaching/learning environment in undergraduate physics                      laboratories inhibits critical thinking about the experiment,                   the data, and the physics by a lack of time to do detailed                      analysis of the data during the laboratory period. This                         situation can be corrected significantly by the use of                          microcomputers in the laboratory with data acquisition hardware                 and software to speed data collection.  A spread sheet program                  and a graphical package allow real-time data manipulation                       leading toward increased confidence in the quality of the data                  and into insights into the physics the data portray.  Student                   or instructor written programs provide special analysis                         tools.This new environment, common to the physics researcher,                   now can be the domain of the physics student.  Modest prices                    for powerful desk-top computers makes it possible to install                    one work station for every two students with data acquisition                   hardware and software.  Given these tools and guided in their                   constructive use, students can investigate the \"what if\"                        questions prompted by a critical analysis of the experiment.                    A greater appreciation of the real methodologies of                             experimental physics can emerge and develop.",
