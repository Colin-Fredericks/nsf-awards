 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current rapid developments in the biological sciences are enlarging             and altering our understanding of living systems, from individual               cells to global ecosystems.  These changes in knowledge carry                   profound, but insufficiently explored implications for social                   institutions and policies.  Historians, social scientists and                   biologists in the Program on Science, Technology and Society of                 Cornell University are addressing these implications in a series                of five interrelated research projects:  (1) biology and the legal              order, (2) environmental change, (3) communication and use of                   scientific knowledge, (4) historical studies of scientific change,              and (5) women and biology.                                                                                                                                      In the first research project, historians, lawyers and ethicians                are examining the legal, social and ethical implications of recent              developments in genetic screening, gene therapy, and environmental              regulations.  Family, employment, health, education, and criminal               justice are all affected by the advances in biological sciences and             issues of privacy, equal protection, due process, free exercise of              religion, academic freedom, and separation of powers immediately                come to the fore.  Environmental scientists, historians and social              scientists are joining together in the second project to                        investigate questions like the socioeconomic implications of global             change, the pattern and scale in spatially explicit ecological                  models, integrated resource management for an ecologically and                  economically sound agriculture, and social construction of                      environmental modeling. Research in area 3 focuses on the role and              activities of scientists and other social actors in the                         dissemination of scientific information through varied channels of              communication.  In area 4, researchers aim to develop an                        understanding of current developments in the life sciences within               the framework of historical and philosophical perspectives on                   science in general; and to apply ideas about the meaning and nature             of scientific change to assessing the significance and direction                of contemporary trends in the life sciences.  Under \"women and                  biology, investigators are examining the historical phenomenon of               why American women scientists have more often gone into biological              fields rather than into physical, mathematical or engineering                   specialties and the implications of this phenomenon for the \"style\"             of work in the life sciences.                                                                                                                                   Over five years, this grant supports postdoctoral fellows, graduate             and undergraduate student to participate in research and training               in each of these areas of research.",
