 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three-year project, Science Experiences and Resources                    for Informal Education Settings (SERIES), involves                              collaboration between the 4-H Youth Development Program,                        practicing scientists, science education centers, and                           community service agencies to provide community-based                           science experiences for youth.  Goals for national                              dissemination of the SERIES project are: 1) Increase the                        quality and quantity of science experiences for youth as                        leaders and as learners; 2) For youth to actively experience                    how science concepts and processes relate to their everyday                     lives; 3) Provide opportunities for youth to take positive                      leadership roles in their homes and communities; and 4)                         Provide opportunities for youth to investigate educational                      and career possibilities in science and technology through a                    scientist mentor relationship.  SERIES builds upon the                          materials, and instructional/coaching model successfully                        developed and tested during the Califronia SERIES Project.                      National dissemination by 4-H assures SERIES availability to                    the 5,100,000 youth currently enrolled in 4-H.                                                                                                                       Expected outcomes of SERIES are: 1) Refine and produce                     final versions in English and Spanish of four SERIES                            community service science units; 2) Develop two new units;                      3) Development of an \"inquiry coaching\" module for adult                        volunteers; 4) Develop and asses apprentice-like mentoring                      experiences for SERIES teens to work directly with                              scientists; and 5) Establish four SERIES regional                               dissemination centers, working collaboratively with 4-H,                        science centers and other youth serving agencies to provide                     national dissemination of the SERIES program model to 28                        states.",
