 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one-year pilot program for experienced community college                   physics teachers provides two curriculum development workshops                  during the 1991-92 academic year at two geographically                          dispersed community college campuses.  One workshop fosters the                 approach of using microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL).  The                  other advocates employing conceptual exercises (CE) and                         overview case studies (OCS).  The workshops are derived from                    successful models that apply findings of cognitive physics                      education research.Each three-day workshop is led by two senior                 university/college physics professors who played a major role                   in the development and promotion of MBL and CE/OCS.  These                      hands-on workshops allow community college physics teacher                      participants to gain knowledge about recent developments in                     these areas and  encourage participants to adapt or develop                     curriculum materials which incorporate this knowledge at their                  own community colleges.The main goal of this project is to help                 community college students develop a stronger understanding of                  physics.  The impact of the workshops is reinforced afterwards                  by the establishment of a networking system employing                           telecommunications bulletin board systems and a newsletter.                     Extension of this program to additional sites in other regions                  of the country is anticipated.",
