 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary research objective is to develop a framework based             on the recently discovered differential equation approach for                   solving motion related problems that arise in manufacturing                     automation.  It is of particular interest to produce an advance in              the theory of swept volumes, which will lead to improved means of               representing and analyzing sweeps and swept volumes that occur in               numerically controlled (NC) machining, robot manipulation, etc.                 Also of interest is to investigate the full potential of the                    differential equation approach as a tool for characterizing                     intersections of swept volumes, which leads to solutions for                    collision detection and other motion planning problems.                              The method will be applied to program verification and motion              planning problems in NC machining and robotics.  The tasks include              identification of classes of sweeps, characterization of                        singularities in swept volumes and detection of collision with                  obstacles (both static and dynamic).  The project will include work             on implementing the results for practical applications.",
