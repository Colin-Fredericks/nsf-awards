 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a two year cooperative                          project between a group from the Environmental Sciences                         Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory led by Dr Donald                        Deangelis, and a group from Ryukoku University, Japan, led by                   Professor Ei Teramoto.  The objective of the proposed                           research is to demonstrate how the macroscopic processes of                     energy and nutrient flow in an ecosystem are related to the                     spatiotemporal behavior and fate of species populations                         within that ecosystem.  Traditionally, two general theories                     have been applied to the understanding of ecological food                       webs, namely the population and community dynamics theory,                      emphasizing the modelling of population numbers, and the                        ecosystem process theory, emphasizing the modelling of energy                   and nutrient flows.  There has been relatively little                           interaction between ecologists employing each of these                          approaches and this has hindered the development of ecological                  theory.  This project aims at developing theoretical approach                   to ecological food webs which integrates both approaches.                       Two specific food webs are to be studied; a termite-microbial-                  detritus interaction in a subtropical ecosystem, and a                          periphyton-grazer community in artificial streams.  The                         project will involve the development of models linking                          ecosystem energy and nutrient flows with population dynamics.                   This integrated approach, may help clarify several important                    theoretical questions including the relationships of energy                     and nutrient supply regimes to the stability and species                        diversity within an ecosystem, the coevolution of species in                    relation to structure and processes in food webs, and the                       causes and effects of spatiotemporal heterogeneity of                           ecosystems.                                                                                                                                                     Both the US and Japanese scientists involved in the project                     are highly regarded in their fields.  The two groups have                       complementary research interests with similar aims but                          different orientations, the US group being more oriented                        towards ecosystem processes, and the Japanese group more                        towards population/community dynamics. This project should                      yield new insights into the interplay between the dynamic                       processes of species populations in an ecosystem and the                        ecosystem processes of energy and nutrient flow, which could                    have important implications in the context of both landscape                    ecology, and issues such as the greenhouse effect, acid rain                    and biodiversity.",
