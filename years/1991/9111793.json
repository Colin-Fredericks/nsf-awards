 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer architecture is becoming a well-understood science.                    However, it is currently dominated by traditional synchronous                   implementations of architectural ideas.  As techniques for building             asynchronous circuits, and self-timed circuits in particular,                   improve, it becomes more reasonable to ask what effect these                    circuit techniques might have on the architecture of computers.                 Clocked synchronous circuits, for example, tend to reflect worst-               case behavior because the clock cycle must be long enough for the               worst-case path through some component of the system.  Asynchronous             systems, on the other hand, tend to reflect average-case                        performance because results from one component are available as the             computation completes.  Asynchronous systems can also take direct               advantage of incremental process or technology improvements and can             thus remain productive over longer periods of time.  This research              studies the ways in which asynchrony can be used to increase                    performance at an architectural level.                                                                                                                          A framework is developed that allows different processor                        organizations to be considered.  The result of this study proposed              architecture that uses asynchrony to improve processor performance.             Parts of the proposed architecture are tested by using an automatic             translation system to generate circuits from program descriptions.",
