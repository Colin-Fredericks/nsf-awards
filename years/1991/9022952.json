 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent Federal legislation has increased the importance of the                  contingent valuation(CV) method for valuing goods, particularly                 environmental amenities, not sold in markets.  The method is now                widely used but is subject to several theoretical and applied                   problems that have led to lively debates among economists as well               as extensive litigation in the courts.  This proposal outlines                  two studies designed to improve CV methods and, specifically, the               use of expressed willingness to pay(WTP) measures of resource                   value.  The first study examines how much, and what kind of,                    information should be provided to respondents as part of a CV                   study.  The second study explores linkages between CV methods and               the multiattribute utility approaches commonly used in the                      decision sciences.  This study has as its core the belief that                  preferences are constructive and that determinations of total                   resource values can arise only through an understanding of the                  component parts.  By helping to resolve these two vexing problems               currently facing CV researchers, results of the proposed studies                will improve the defensibility of an important approach to                      estimating economic value.",
