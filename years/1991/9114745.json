 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-temperature deformation of metal-matrix composites will be                 studied from the micromechanics standpoint.  The study will also                include the influence of distributed damage in the ductile matrix               on the overall time-dependent behavior of the material.  Guided by              the observations that most metallic constituents may undergo both               primary and secondary creep in addition to the usual elastic                    deformation, and that the creep rate usually depends on stress                  nonlinearly, the following four specific problems will be examined:             (1) stress-strain relation of the composite under a constant strain             rate, (2) higher creep strain range, and (4) the extension to a                 higher particle or fiber concentration.  These studies will be                  carried out with a special reference to the practical and potential             service environments.  Whenever possible, simple macroscopic                    constitutive theories which can reflect the essential features of               these micromechanical considerations will be developed for design               and analysis.  The aim is to translate this scientific knowledge                into use, so that the microstructures which would provide the                   strongest creep resistance under the service conditions could be                identified.",
