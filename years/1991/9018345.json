 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most fundamental processes inherent in animal cells is               the capacity to transport ions and water.  These processes are                  very important in the functioning of the human body, for example,               in the production of saliva, sweat, urine, stomach secretions                   etc.                                                                                                                                                            Dr. Bradley is studying insects that live in a very saline lake,                Mono Lake, in east central California.  This lake is 2.5 times as               salty as the ocean and contains very high levels of sulfate.                    Despite these unusual conditions, brine flies live by the                       billions in Mono Lake.  He is investigating the mechanisms of                   salt transport in the midgut (the site of salt entry) and hindgut               (the site of salt exit) in these flies.  The flies may well                     contain the most active sulfate pumps known in biology.  He                     anticipates that the information he will gather will be of broad                use in understanding the mechanisms of salt transport in other                  biological systems and in man, for example in the kidney.                                                                                                       It is a well established practice to examine physiological                      processes in non-human model systems where the process is highly                exaggerated.  Electrical generation has been very successfully                  studied in electric eels, nervous function in the giant axons of                squid and processes of genetic selection in the fruit fly which                 has very short generation times.  He intends to use the same                    principle in examining sulfate transport in the most active                     sulfate system known.",
