 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of electron transfer reactions both in solution and                   at electrode surfaces is currently an area of vigorous                          research.  At the present, however, there exist a number of                     experimental constraints that hinder the study of many aspects                  of heterogenous electron transfer.  A goal of the project of                    Dr. Widrig is the development of a general technique for the                    examination of electrode reactions which will overcome many of                  these current limitations.  In her experimental approach, the                   technology that recently has been refined in the realization of                 the scanning tunneling microscope will be applied to the                        investigation of the redox chemistry of individual molecules.                   This will be accomplished by using the tip of the scanning                      tunneling microscope and a planar electrode substrate as the                    two working electrodes of a bipotentiostat.  The substrate                      electrode will be derivatized with an organized, monomolecular                  layer containing a reversible redox reagent.  As the tip is                     positioned within Angstroms above the substrate surface,                        voltages suitable for oxidation and reduction of the                            immobilized species will be applied to the tip and substrate                    electrodes, respectively.  As the immobilized molecule over                     which the tip is positioned is continually oxidized and                         reduced, the magnitude of the resulting current will be                         dependent on the rate constant for heterogeneous electron                       transfer to that species.  Preliminary calculations indicate                    that measureable currents will be obtained for redox couples                    whose standard rate constants are greater than 2 cm/s.                          Successful implementation of this technique will permit the                     measurement of formerly indeterminable rate constants for                       \"fast\" electrode reactions and allow an unprecedented                           assessment of the roles of the electrode-reactant separation,                   orientation, and environment in heterogeneous electron                          transfer.  Preliminary work includes the preparation and                        characterization of the electroactive monolayer, the                            development of tip insulation procedures, and modeling of                       heterogeneous electron transfer through individual molecules.                   %%%                                                                             Research Planning Grants enable women who have not had prior                    independent Federal research support to develop a competitive                   research project.  This project involves the use of technology                  for the precise placement of electrodes in the scanning                         tunneling microscope for precision electrolysis of an organized                 monomolecular layer.  This will permit the measurement of the                   rates of electron transfer previously not measurable.",
