 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continental Scientific Drilling is an essential activity of                programs within the DOE, NSF, and USGS.  The present U.S.                       Continental Scientific Drilling Program consists of a coordinated               set of these activities that is also consistent with the missions               of each Agency.  Because the programs of the participating Agencies             are related in scientific interests, a coordinated interagency                  effort in continental scientific drilling is both cost effective                and highly beneficial.  The Interagency Coordinating Group for                  Continental Scientific Drilling (ICG), formally in existence since              the signing of the Interagency Accord on Continental Scientific                 Drilling in 1984, provides this coordination.                                                                                                                        This action provides funds in the form of an interagency                   transfer to the USGS to cover NSF's share of ICG expenses (Annual               Report to Congress, ICG staff, workshop reports, etc.).                         Specifically, a expenses related to the Environmental Impact                    Statement for the Katmai Scientific Drilling Project which is being             coordinated for the ICG by the USGS.",
