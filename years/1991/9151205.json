 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is one component of our plan to increase the                      participation of psychology majors in independent scientific                    research.  We have two goals:  One is to increase the quality                   of scientific thinking among our majors so that they will                       receive more effective liberal educations; the second is to                     encourage more students to pursue careers in cognitive science.                 The requested microcomputer cluster will allow us to integrate                  research methods courses and cognitive core courses on                          learning, memory and cognition, and perception.  In addition,                   we will have greater flexibility to add timely experiments to                   the laboratories.  Students will be able to manipulate the                      parameters of those experiments so that they can participate                    more fully in the entire research process rather than simply                    doing experiments to confirm principles.  Finally, a supervised                 cluster in the Psychology Department will give the students                     expert assistance in using the computers, and it will create a                  place where students can gather, carry out their research                       projects, and discuss the results.  This increased student                      involvement in research should lead to more students performing                 independent projects.  Thus, we envision an integrated,                         laboratory based curricular path beginning with basic                           instruction in research design and analysis and culminating in                  a piece of independent research.",
