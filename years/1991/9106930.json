 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bumblebees are perhaps the most important of all pollinators               of plants in the Arctic.  Their ability to perform at low air                   temperature is based on their remarkable ability to produce heat                by shivering and to keep warm in order to remain active.  But                   shivering only affects the thoracic muscles that drive the                      wings.  The abdomen, which contains no heat-producing tissues,                  remains cold unless heat is shunted to that area from the                       exercising flight muscles.                                                           In order to reproduce and live in the Arctic, the bees must                squeeze their entire life cycle into a single, short summer.  For               them, time is temperature; to accelerate egg production and                     development rates they must also keep the eggs warm.  The                       investigators plan to  examine the hypothesis that Arctic                       bumblebee queens \"incubate\" their eggs not only after they are                  laid, but also while they are still developing in the abdomen.                  The energy cost of this heat production is likely very high.  But               it must be met because of the time constraint.  This                            investigation will help determine the importance of temperature                 regulation in the evolution of the unique life history of the                   bumblebee and will further elucidate one of the many patterns of                adaptation employed by animals in the harsh, yet fragile Arctic                 environment.",
