 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regulation of cell metabolism is a complex process, occurring               at different levels during development.  Important metabolic                    enzymes, such as ketone bodies enzymes, are differentially                      expressed in other cells from brain.  During development, ketone                bodies are an important source of energy for metabolism and serve               as precursors for lipid synthesis in brain.  The Principal                      investigator is interested in how glucocorticoids, steroid                      hormones, stimulate the activity of a ketone body metabolizing                  enzyme, 3-ketoacid CoA transferase.  This research project will                 investigate how glucocorticoid hormones influence the metabolic                 activity of oligodentrocytes, specialized glial cells which form                myelin sheaths, the insulating layer surrounding axons.                         Experiments using cultures of oligodentrocytes will be used to                  study the various steps in the synthesis of coenzyme A                          transferase.  Studies will be performed to determine the effect                 of glucocorticoids on the transcription of gene coding for this                 enzyme.  As the myelin sheath assures integrity of transmission                 in the nervous system, this research has far reaching                           implications for neurobiology.",
