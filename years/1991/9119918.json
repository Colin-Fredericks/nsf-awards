There exists a domain of problems                                               which require large-scale                                                       decentralized control of complex                                                non-linear dynamics.  The use of                                                hydrogen as both fuel and coolant in                                            hypersonic vehicles, such as the                                                National Aerospace Plane (NASP),                                                presents such a problem.  The NASP                                              will use hydrogen fuel to cool the                                              engine and remove the excessive heat                                            on the vehicle surface caused by                                                high energy air flow during                                                     hypersonic flight.  In the thermal                                              management system, the hydrogen flow                                            patterns and routing schemes for                                                cooling such a vehicle incorporate                                              multiple levels of tiered                                                       distribution.  However, there exist                                             severe weight penalties in a large                                              scale system which requires and                                                 abundance of fuel and high pressure                                             valves necessary to cool the most                                               extreme temperatures which appear                                               only in local areas or \"hot spot\".                                              Unless coolant can be efficiently                                               and actively controlled to cool                                                 these local areas, the weight                                                   penalties could prevent orbital                                                 capability.  Since flow is regulated                                            through the valved adjustment of                                                inlet and exit pressures for                                                    multiple sets of panels connected in                                            parallel and/or series, and                                                     decentralized control approach will                                             provide a method to globally                                                    optimize coolant to a large-scale                                               distributed system of panels and                                                valves.  A decentralized control                                                architecture will be developed and                                              tested on a representative small                                                scale problem to globally optimize                                              the arm trajectory of a three link                                              manipulator.  Future work will                                                  address issues involved in the                                                  hierarchical and heterarchical                                                  scaling of this decentalized control                                            architecture and the architecture                                               will be evaluated using the NASP                                                thermal management system                                                       simulation.",
