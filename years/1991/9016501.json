 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Italy award will support a long-term visit by                         Professor Peter Dorato of the University of New Mexico to the                   Politecnico di Torino to collaborate with Professor Roberto                     Tempo and others of that institution.  The main focus of the                    research will be on the extension of the U.S. principal                         investigator's theory of U-parameter design for robust feed                     back systems to multi-variable systems and multi-objective                      design problems. The principal investigator's theory of U-                      parameter design is based on the parameterization of all                        robustly stabilizing compensators by an arbitrary bounded-                      real function, or matrix is the multivariable, when the plant                   perturbations are assumed to be unstructured perturbations,                     specified in the frequency domain.  This fee parameter-                         function has been exploited to optimize system performance                      for the nominal plant, in the case of single-input-output                       systems.  A major thrust of the proposed sabbatical research                    will be to extend these results to multivariable systems.                                                                                                       A final area of proposed research will be the study of robust                   control for systems with both unstructured frequency-domain                     uncertainty and parameter uncertainty.  The principal                           investigator has focused his research in the former area and                    the Italian investigator has focused his research in the                        latter area.  It is expected that this research will provide                    further insight into the design of robust multivariable                         systems.  This should provide design tools for the accurate                     control of complex systems in the presence of significant                       uncertainties in plant dynamics.",
