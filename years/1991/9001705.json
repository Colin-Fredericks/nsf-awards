 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a program of research on several topics in                         combinatorial optimization with the objective of enhancing                      understanding of the underlying mathematics of some combinatorial               problems.  The importance of the research lies in the fact that a               better understanding of the mathematics associated with these                   problems (most of them belonging to the class of nonpolynomial-                 complete or hard problems) can be used in the design of algorithms              that solve and prove optimality of medium to large instances that               typically arise in real world applications.  The research includes              investigation of the properties of 0, 1 matrices, whose                         associated set packing polytope has integer extreme points, and the             facial structure of some combinatorial polytopes associated with                connectivity and partitioning problems on graphs.  The algorithmic              issues associated with the detection of violated constraints for                such problems will be investigated.                                                  The problem area of combinatorial optimization is very                     important, a breakthrough in this area would be highly leveraged.",
