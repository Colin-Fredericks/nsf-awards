 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ceramic honeycomb monoliths were initially developed as                         catalyst supports for use in automotive catalytic converters.                                                                                                   Monolithic catalyst support provides a means of contacting a                    gas and a liquid with a solid catalyst.  This catalyst support                                                                                                  delivers low pressure drop because of its unique geometry.                      High reaction rates may be obtained because of the high                         surface area of the catalyst and the low mass transfer                          resistance which can be realized when slug flow is maintained                                                                                                   within the channels of the monolith.  The proper use of such a                                                                                                  catalyst requires uniform distribution of gas and liquid in                     the open cells of the monolith.                                                                                                                                 This research will involve the construction and operation of a                                                                                                  novel monolithic reactor in which a uniform gas-liquid feed is                                                                                                  produced through the formation of a two-phase froth within the                                                                                                  same vessel.  The froth is a vehicle for the introduction of                    controlled volumes of gas and into the channels of the                          monolith in slug flow.  The reactor will be evaluated for the                                                                                                   aqueous phase oxidation of phenol over copper oxide catalyst                    and the results compared with data reported from a slurry                       reactor.  Flow visualization experiments will be used to                        determine the hydrodynamic parameters necessary to obtain the                                                                                                   desired slug flow within the monolith and understand the means                                                                                                  by which the froth characteristics may be controlled.  A                        reactor model based upon the hydrodynamics within square                        channels of the monolith will be developed, a model with a                      minimum of adjustable parameters.",
