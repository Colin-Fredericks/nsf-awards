 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to provide research support for Dr. Brian E.                      Thompson under the National Science Foundation's Presidential                   Young Investigator Awards Program.                                                                                                                              Glow discharge (plasma) processing plays a large role in the                    semiconductor industry.  The overall goal of this research is                   to be able to operate and develop plasma processes better by                    having (1) increased understanding of the physical phenomena,                   (2) predictive simulation techniques, and (3) more                              easily-applied experimental diagnostics.  Studying electron                     and ion concentrations in plasma discharges is a major thrust                   of this project because these charged particles affect                          gas-phase reactions and surface phenomena.  The goal is to                      develop non-intrusive techniques to determine electron and ion                  concentrations and energies in industrially-used reactors.                      The PI also plans to model charged particles in plasmas.  One                   goal is to create a model that predicts electron and ion                        energies and concentrations in radio-frequency plasmas.  The                    other goal is to examine and optimize the solution techniques                   for the model equations.  Besides charged-particle analysis,                    he will examine the reactions of charge-neutral species in the                  discharge.  One long term goal of this modeling is finding a                    practical way of                                                                predicting creation rates of neutral species from                               electron-molecule collisions as a function of discharge                         operating parameters.  Another goal is to develop experimental                  techniques, especially frequency response analysis, for                         determining the applicable rate                                                 constants in an operating system.  The above will be applied                    to the low-frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition                  of nitrides and oxides and oxygen/nitrogen plasmas for                          cleaning electronic parts.",
