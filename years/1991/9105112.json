 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is far less quantitative information about the evolution             and history of climate on the continents than in the deep sea.                  Among the reasons for this is a scarcity of quantitative proxy                  indicators of continental climate.  The work outlined is an effort              to develop and apply techniques for using oxygen and hydrogen                   isotope ratios of minerals in soil profiles as indicators of                    climatic conditions during the soil-forming process.  The initial               stage of the research will consist of detailed studies of a series              of active weathering profiles developed on a variety of parent                  materials in a variety of climatic regimes.  Weathering profiles                targeted for this study include lateritic soils in the Amazon Basin             of Brazil, saprolites on the Virginia Piedmont, and weathering                  profiles developed on Hawaiian basalts under varying rainfall                   regimes.  The approach combines careful field description,                      petrographic and mineralogical study, isotopic analysis of soil                 water and isotopic analysis of separated soil minerals.  We expect              this proposed study of modern weathering profiles to lead to an                 understanding of the climatic factors which control the isotopic                compositions of soil minerals.  In a later stage of the project we              will apply the results of the initial stage of the work to the                  study of paleosols.  The most important result expected from the                proposed work is the development of new tools for the study of                  continental paleoclimates.  When these tools are widely applied in              this and later studies, the information obtained will be useful for             global paleoclimatic reconstructions and the testing of climate                 models.",
