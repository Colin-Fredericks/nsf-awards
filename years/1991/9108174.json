 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the North Carolina SuperQuest competition for               1991.  The objective of the competition is to introduce                         computational science into the classroom at all educational levels              and to encourage more student interest in studies and careers in                science, engineering and mathematics.  All of the high schools in               North Carolina were invited to enter the competition.  The                      competing teams will consist of four students and two teachers.                 The subject matter will be a scientifically sound and                           computationally challenging problem that they can solve using the               supercomputing resources at the North Carolina Supercomputing                   Center (NCSC).  There will be five winning teams.  These teams will             attend a 2 and 1/2 week summer institute at NCSC in June, 1991.                 During the Summer Institute the 20 students and 10 teachers will                be trained to use the NCSC supercomputing resources and graphics                workstations available at NCSC to design a computational solution               to the problem they have proposed.",
