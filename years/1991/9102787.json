The amendment is necessary to:  1) fully implement NSF's Special                5-Year Initiative for Antarctic Safety, Environment and Health (a               critical part of which is the development of baselines for a wide               variety of antarctic environmental parameters) and the conduct of               projects for monitoring of potential environmental contaminants                 near USAP's antarctic installations; 2) assure that environmental               measurements are reliable and repeatable, and provide sound bases               for environment-related actions undertaken by USAP managers and                 decisionmakers; and 3) provide guidance on and conduct                          environmental measurements to other performers involved in USAP's               developing environmental measurements, assessment, management,                  and protection programs; and, 4) provide similar support to basic               science researchers supported by the Division of Polar Programs                 whose work includes measurement of antarctic environmental                      parameters.  The Program Manager recommends award for Fiscal Year               1991 funds of $225,000.",
