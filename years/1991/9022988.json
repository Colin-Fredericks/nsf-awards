 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to examine and compare sources of contem-                 porary racial unrest in the United States and in South Africa.                  The proposed research builds on previous research supported by                  NSF and expands the ecological perspective by (1) considering how               the timing and goals of state actions regarding desegregation                   policies intensify racial competition and conflict, (2)                         establishing a comparative context within which new applications                of event-history methods will be applied to the best available                  data on racial conflicts in the United States and South Africa,                 and (3) giving substantial attention to violent events initiated                by dominant groups:  white citizens, the police, and other agents               of the state apparatuses in the two countries.  The key argument                is that initial deviation from complete segregation sparks                      intense racial unrest.  This argument is tested using data on                   desegregation and racial conflict in cities in the United States                during 1960-1990 and in cities in South Africa during 1970-1984.                Data on the occurrence and timing of racial events have been                    coded from newspaper accounts that provide continuous coverage of               events in the United States and South Africa.   The proposed                    project uses event-history methods to analyze parallel models of                racial conflict in the two countries.  Such models use                          information on the exact timing and duration of events so that                  effects of changes in racial policies and racial segregation                    during this period can be examined directly.",
