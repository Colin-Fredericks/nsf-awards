The                    program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,                      and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise                    and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                             This award, sponsored by Dr. Joyce E. Loper of Oregon State                     University, will support a twelve-month postdoctoral                            research visit by Dr. Carolee T. Bull with Dr. Dieter Haas                      of Eidgen\u001assische Technische Hochschule (ETH), Z\u001arich,                          Switzerland.  Certain strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, when                  applied to seeds of agricultural plants, control plant                          diseases caused by soilborne fungi.  P. fluorescens strains                     CHAO and Pf-5 control a seedling disease of cucumber caused                     by the fungal phytopathogen, Pythium ultimum, and produce                       the antifungal metabolite, pyoluteorin.  Pyoluteorin                            production is implicated in the biocontrol activity of                          strain Pf-5 but the role of pyoluteorin produced by strain                      CHAO in disease suppression is unknown.  A cosmid clone,                        pME3090, obtained from a genomic library of CHAO, confers to                    strain CHAO an enhanced biocontrol activity, and enhanced                       production of pyoluteorin and of a second antifungal                            compound, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol production to the                          enhanced biocontrol activity of CHAO/pME3090 will be                            elucidated through a combination of molecular and agronomic                     approaches.  The proposed research will use organisms and                       techniques developed in the United States and Switzerland to                    determine the role of pyoluteorin production in biological                      control by CHAO.  The specific objectives are to: (1)                           Identify genes involved in pyoluteorin production; (2)                          Generate mutants in strain CHAO that are defective specifi-                     cally in the production of pyoluteorin (Plt); (3) Determine                     the relative ability of pyoluteorin mutants, 2, 4-diacetylph-                   loroglucinol mutants (Phl) and of wildtype CHAO to control                      plant diseases.  The proposed research will provide critical                    information describing fundamental mechanisms in the                            biocontrol of plant diseases.
