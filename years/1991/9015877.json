 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in astronomical instrumentation have permitted                  small observatories in liberal arts colleges to automate the                    operation of their telescopes and to measure the brightnesses of                astronomical objects quickly and accurately with modern \"CCD\"                   (Charged Couple Device) detectors.  In the last few years the                   Principal Investigator (PI) and his colleagues have used awards                 from the Keck Foundation and the NSF to upgrade their Wesleyan                  University 24-inch telescope in these ways.  In this NSF grant he               plans to use them as a combined research and teaching tool for                  undergraduates.  The PI and his students will observe selected                  T Tauri and supernova stars over time.  The T Tauri stars are                   thought to be extremely young, and are known to have both irregular             and periodic components to their variability.  The irregular                    component is likely to arise from material falling onto a                       circumstellar disk around the star.  In contrast, the periodic                  component is likely to be produced by the appearance and subsequent             disappearance of a magnetic \"spot\" from our view as the star                    rotates.  A secondary project will be the monitoring of supernovae              light in nearby galaxies.  Supernovae are known to be members of                a discrete number of subgroups each with well defined properties                determined by their \"light curve\" with time.  These properties can              be related to the absolute luminosity of the supernova.  The PI                 will monitor supernova light curves in order to determine how many              belong to each of these subgroups, thereby providing information                on the probability of different types of supernova-generating                   evolutionary scenarios, as well as the absolute luminosities of                 these stars themselves.  By comparing observed brightnesses with                derived luminosities the PI will be able to determine the distance              to the supernova and hence the external galaxy.",
