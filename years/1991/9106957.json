 "awd_abstract_narration": "An accurate description of NA secondary structure must now                      include many conformations beyond those represented by a                        random coil or Watson-Crick double helix.  Structural                           variants such as cruciform, hairpin, and hinged DNA along                       with the more transiently formed bulged  or slipped sequences                   are often cited as the possible origin of mutational                            hotspots.  Such aberrant conformations may adversely affect                     both the fidelity of DNA repair and the rate of nucleotide                      modification.  This study has been designed to examine the                      molecular basis of this latter process by systematically                        evaluating the effect of duplex structure on the reactivity                     of DNA in a well defined model system.                                          Photochemical modification of synthetic oligonucleotides                        serves as the primary method of derivatization and                              specifically, pyrimidine dimerization will be used to                           indicate the requirements of base mobility and orientation                      for DNA hyperreactivity.  Kinetic and product analysis will                     determine the reaction efficiencies in helical and hairpin                      conformations containing mispaired or unpaired nucleotides.                     Concurrent chemical and enzymatic studies will generate a                       traditional and necessary context for interpreting the                          photochemical results.  1) Selective oxidation of DNA by KMnO4                  will indicate the general accessibility of the thymine bases                    and 2) strand scission catalyzed by S-1 nuclease will                           demonstrate the related accessibilty of the sugar phosphate                     backbone.",
