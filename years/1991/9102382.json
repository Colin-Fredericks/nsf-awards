 "awd_abstract_narration": "Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have the potential to                    revolutionize rapid hardware prototyping both in industry and in                university research and instruction.  To realize this potential,                FPGA placement and routing tools must be orders of magnitude faster             than those currently available.  This project is investigating the              use of incremental placement and routing to speed up FPGA design.               Design is an iterative process characterized by small changes.  By              processing design changes as minimally as possible, incremental                 placement and routing has the potential to be dramatically faster               than conventional tools which must reprocess an entire design from              scratch.  For placement, a generalized incremental form of the                  force-directed algorithm with time-varying cost functions is being              investigated.  Routing is being investigated using incremental                  penalty-driven iterative improvement and a generalized graph                    representation of routing resources.  The algorithms produced will              be implemented to demonstrate their efficacy and at the same time               provide high-quality FPGA design tools.  As a side benefit, the                 algorithms will also be applicable to conventional IC and PC board              placement and routing tasks.",
