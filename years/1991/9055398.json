 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is designed to create among middle-school                         teachers and their students an enhanced awareness and                           understanding of global environmental issues by providing a                     structure for the transfer of marine and aquatic research                       results and methods to middle-school educators.  A total of                     150 teachers will participate in five, three-week summer                        workshops during a three-year period.  Each of the five                         workshops will be conducted at the Gulf Coast Research                          Laboratory located in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. The                           workshops are designed to: (a) raise the awareness and                          understanding of the participants concerning global                             environmental issues; (b) give the participants a variety of                    field, laboratory, and classroom teaching techniques; (c)                       provide a forum for teachers' interaction with research                         scientists; and (d) translate research into teaching                            applications.  The teachers participating in these workshops                    will represent Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and Louisiana.                    Each of the workshops will recruit participants from these                      four states.                                                                                                                                                    Each of the three-week workshops will be supported by                           \"follow-up\" participation in state, regional, and/or national                   meetings. During the academic year, participating teachers                      are expected to develop an inservice training program within                    their respective school districts.                                                                                                                              Four general areas of global environmental concern will be                      addressed by this project.  They are: (1) climatic changes,                     (2) marine and estuarine pollution, (3) decline in                              biodiversity, and (4) overpopulation.  A multi-disciplinary                     approach will be utilized through the interactions of                           research scientists, marine and science educators, and                          classroom teachers.  Teaching methodologies will encompass                      the science/technology/society philosophical approach.                                                                                                          In summary, this project, through the interaction of the                        middle-school classroom teachers, marine educators and marine                   scientists should provide an excellent opportunity for                          science teachers and other science educators to improve their                   knowledge and skills relating to the study of global                            environmental issues.  The 150 teachers, representing four                      states, have the potential of reaching more than 22,000                         students.                                                                                                                                                       Cost sharing equals 39% of the NSF award.",
