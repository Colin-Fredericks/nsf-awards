 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will analyze the effect of landscape factors                 and interference competition on the abundance of a neotropical                  migrant, the Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera).  This               species has declined and even disappeared from a large portion of               its range.  This decline has been attributed to a loss of                       breeding habitat, or to behavioral interactions with an invading                congener, or to a loss of winter habitat.  Field studies will                   determine the vegetative characteristics of the nesting habitat                 used by the Golden-winged Warbler alone and in sympatry with the                Blue-winged Warbler (V. pinus).  Landscape analyses, utilizing                  current and historical aerial photographs, will assess changes in               the regional availability of nesting habitat, and will be                       correlated with changes in Golden-winged Warbler abundance.                     Habitat use with and without neighboring Blue-winged Warblers,                  and changes in use following experimental removal of Blue-winged                Warblers will be determined.  Nesting success will be related to                Blue-winged Warbler proximity and to vegetative characteristics                 of nesting habitat.  These studies will help determine if                       coexistence of these two congeners is limited more by                           specialized adaptations to a particular habitat or by their                     behavioral interactions.  These analyses of the breeding season                 may provide insight about the relative significance of winter                   habitat loss.  The results may also be of more general                          significance in light of rapid changes in global Climate and land               use patterns.",
