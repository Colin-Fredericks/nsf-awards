 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Scripps Institute of Oceanography of the University of California               San Diego for the renovation and repair of Sverdrup Hall which                  houses a wide diversity of research activities in geophysics,                   geochemistry, biochemistry, space physics, marine geology, and                  biological oceanography.  This building was constructed in 1960 and             has not previously been renovated.  The ARFMP grant of $550,000 and             $585,303 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to                modernize these research and research training facilities.  This                project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure by renovating the electrical power system and the                heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system so that                 modern research equipment and computers can be operated and samples             and equipment can be protected from the deleterious effects of                  exposure to the salt-air environment.                                                                                                                           This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of more and                   better research in marine sciences in particular and for the                    increased effectiveness of all research and research training                   conducted in Sverdrup Hall.  It will enable scientists at Scripps               to pursue ongoing investigations and to move quickly and                        efficiently into new areas of research, and it will facilitate the              production of even higher quality graduate students who will, as                they have in the past, move on to faculty positions throughout the              nation where they will have an impact on the quality of ocean                   sciences in this and future generations.",
