 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scope of the recently discovered gem-dimethylation reaction                 based on the Tebbe reagent will be explored.  The reaction                      provides a one step route to the important gem-dimethyl                         substructure by the direct conversion of a carbonyl group.  The                 substructure is found in many important natural and synthetic                   products.  The work will seek to provide an understanding of                    the structure, or structures, of the actual active species                      generated from the titanium-based reagent.  The studies will                    explore the preparation of analogous reagents and will probe                    the mechanistic pathways for these species.  The synthetic                      scope of the reaction with different types of carbonyl groups                   will also be explored.                                                          %%%                                                                             With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award,                   the Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Dr.                 Stanley H. Pine of the Department of Chemistry at California                    State, Los Angeles, University.  Dr. Pine's work focuses on a                   new synthetic reaction based on a bimetallic organometallic                     compound containing titanium and aluminum.  The reagent will                    accomplish, in one step, the transformation of a carbonyl group                 into a group that contains a carbon bound to two methyl groups,                 a process that now requires two or more synthetic steps.  The                   development of the reagent will increase the ease and                           directness of the synthesis of a number of terpenoid natural                    products.  The program will also involve undergraduates in a                    meaningful way.",
