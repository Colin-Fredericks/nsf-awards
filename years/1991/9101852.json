 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ichthyological Collection in the Philadelphia Academy of               Natural Sciences contains approximately 1.5 million specimens                   representing more than 10,000 species, as well as 12,000 type                   specimens.  The collection ranks among the ten largest fish                     collections in the western hemisphere, and was the first to                     computerize its entire holdings with MUSE, an NSF-supported                     database program for microcomputers.  Dr. Scott Schaefer, Curator               in charge of the fish collection, proposes to validate the data                 records entered from early (pre-1954) catalog ledgers.  These                   records fail to include many important pieces of information                    (locality descriptions, species identifications, specimen                       measurements) that are available on the labels attached to the                  specimens themselves.  Dr. Schaefer also proposes to standardize                the geographic place names in locality records, and to determine                latitudes and longitudes of localities wherever possible.  These                improvements to the locality records will allow the database                    records to be used directly by Geographic Information Systems                   (GIS) and other mapping software for biogeographic research.  A                 modem will be added to the Collection's computer network,                       allowing remote dial-in for querying the database.                                   The proposed improvements will add significantly to the                    research impact of this important collection.  Computerization of               natural history collections is proving beneficial to collection                 management and to research, and the Ichthyology Collection in the               Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia continues to show                   vision and leadership in this area.",
