 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a cultural resource assessment of the East Base                 site on Stonington Island on the Antarctic Peninsula. East Base was             used as headquarters for two U.S. expeditions, The U.S. Antarctic               Service Expedition (1939-1941) and the Ronne Antarctic Research                 Expedition (1947-1948). This was the first permanent U. S. base on              the Peninsula. East Base has been designated as a registered                    historic site. Because of its historical significance, two National             Park Service archaeologists have been assigned for two months to                carry out a documentation of East Base as it exists today and to                make recommendations for the protection of the site as an historic              monument. A final report will be available by September 30, 1991.               This cultural resource assessment is being carried out in                       connection with the Division of Polar Programs administered clean-              up of East Base which is planned for late February-Early March,                 1991. A Memorandum of Agreement between the National Science                    Foundation and the National Park Service is the basis for this                  project.",
