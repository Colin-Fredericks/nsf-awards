 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working with Dr. Timothy Lenoir of Stanford University, Dr. Pang                is examining the production and reproduction of visual records in               19th century American astrophysics.  Large telescopes, cameras, and             spectrographs were highly promising technologies to 19th century                astrophysicists, but they were difficult to use, and the images                 hard to produce, replicate, and analyze.  Dr. Pang is studying how              those problems and opportunities were dealt with, and how they                  changed astrophysical research.                                                                                                                                 Dr. Pang is beginning his research by examining how the                         technologies affected the work and workplaces of astronomers.  New              telescope systems, consisting of larger optics, accurate tracking               mechanisms, and photographic technology, created opportunities for              new research programs.   However, the new technical skills and                  training they required reshaped the craft of observing, and created             a need for specialists to analyze and reduce large masses of data.              He is then examining how printing technologies--engraving,                      lithography, etc.--defined what images astronomers could reproduce              and share with their colleagues in journals and personal                        communications.  He is also examining how the new images were used              in long-distance collaborative research.  Finally, he is examining              why large telescopes and photography did not displace drawing and               direct observation in a few research areas.  By taking this                     systemic view, and examining the entire range of work required to               produce, share, and use visual records--by moving from the                      telescope, to the analysis room, to the printer's shop, to the                  scientific journal and private letter--Dr. Pang will show how the               production of visual records changed the practice of astrophysical              observation and the making of astrophysical knowledge.",
