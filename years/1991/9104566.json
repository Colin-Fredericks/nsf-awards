 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a study of the design of multiple description             source codes for correlated sources and for speech.  A multiple                 description source code provides the receiver with two different                descriptions of the source sequence.  Hence, if one description is              lost, the other can be used to reconstruct the source.  It is also              desired that if both the descriptions do reach the receiver, the                performance is strictly better than if only one of the descriptions             were to arrive.  Thus the two descriptions must be different and                individually good.                                                                   The first objective is to study multiple description codes for             correlated sources.  This includes the design of good codes as well             as the derivation of performance bounds which are not currently                 available in the literature.  The final goal is to design good, low             complexity multiple description codes for correlated sources.  The              second objective is to study the applications of multiple                       description source codes to speech transmission over packet-                    switched networks.  Packet losses are a significant detriment to                speech quality and multiple description source codes are a good way             to reduce performance degradations due to packet losses.  This                  research will investigate whether significant quality improvements              can be achieved by designing low bit rate waveform and vocoder                  based multiple description speech coders.",
