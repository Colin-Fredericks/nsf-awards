 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in computer                      science between Dr. David Schmidt, Kansas State University,                     and Dr. Daniel Le Metayer, French National Institute for                        Computer Science and Automation (INRIA), in Rennes, France.                     The project addresses the problem of analysis and efficient                     compilation of functional programming languages.                                                                                                                Research at KSU has focused on automated transformation                         techniques for implementing languages defined by denotational                   semantics definitions.  The emphasis has been on using the                      data typing information of a program's denotation to transform                  the expression that represents the denotation into an easily                    implementable form.  Work by the INRIA group at Rennes has                      focused upon the application of transformation techniques for                   the compilation of functional programs.  A methodology has                      been developed for the time and space-complexity analysis of                    functional programs, which has been implemented in the                          framework of a European ESPRIT project.  In this                                collaborative project, the KSU group wishes to benefit from                     the expertise of INRIA in compiler-oriented program transfor-                   mations, in particular in the formation of abstract interpre-                   tations of language definitions.  Since type inference is                       just a simple-minded form of abstract interpretation, and                       since some abstract interpretations can be coded as type                        inference problems, significant gains will be made, once the                    KSU group learns how to adapt its type inference-bases                          analysis method to describe both storage sharing analysis and                   other general abstract interpretation-based analyses.  This                     award will fund the travel of Dr. Schmidt and his postdoc-                      toral to INRIA to carry out this research.",
