 "awd_abstract_narration": "Navigation methods using multi-sensor systems are considered for                terrains whose geometric models are known only in certain parts.                Exact navigation algorithms, as well as those that obtain                       approximate paths with lesser computation time while compromising               the optimality are studied.  Navigational methods for terrains,                 where polygonal approximations are inefficient, are explored                    based on fractal interpolation and approximate path planning.                   The navigation process involves the problem of extracting                       information about the geometry of the terrain by suitably                       combining the sensor outputs.  Techniques for (a) extracting                    integrated information, and (b) fusing the new information into                 the existing terrain model, are investigated.  Two new paradigms                for sensing:  (a) active sensing where sensor operations are                    repeated using sequential statistical methods, and (b) learning                 fusion rules from examples where the system is trained with                     examples using the methods of empirical and structural risk                     minimization, are proposed.  These two methods, together with the               existing Bayesian-based methods, provide the design paradigms for               the multi-sensor system.  For computational purposes, a general                 distributed sensor system specified by a set of first order                     propositional sentences is proposed.  This system encompasses, as               special cases, the distributed versions of Bayesian inference,                  and geometric reasoning with logic and algebra.  In the case of                 sensors whose outputs are real-valued vectors, the entire process               of sensor integration is shown to be implementable in hardware                  using combinational circuits and comparators.  This                             implementation is particularly suitable for real-time                           applications.  Also implementations on several other                            computational systems are studied.",
