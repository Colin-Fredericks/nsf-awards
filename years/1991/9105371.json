This year's symposium is organized by Allan Spradling,                 current President of the Society, on the subject of \"Evolutionary               Conservation of Developmental Mechanisms\". Each session will                    focus on a particular developmental process as studied in a                     phylogenetically diverse group of organisms. Sessions will focus                on changes in genome structure, stem cell maintenance, sex                      determination, signal transduction and pattern formation. It is                 hoped that underlying mechanisms that have been widely utilized                 throughout the course of evolution will be revealed. The meeting                is usually of medium-size (300-400 registrants) with a single                   platform session held at a time (25-30 speakers total), and with                60-80 posters. It is attended by graduate students, postdoctoral                fellows, and senior researchers. All speakers have been requested               to prepare summaries of their presentations of publication in the               annual symposium volume.",
