 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is expanding the Oberlin College physics                           department's existing network of two UNIX work-stations                         (currently used solely for research) to nine machines.  These                   computers are being used for student/faculty research and for                   assignments and projects in existing courses, but most                          importantly they are making possible a new course entitled                      \"Introduction to Computational Physics\". This course takes                      advantage of the many cases in which the physical question and                  its algorithmic solution are intimately linked, so the physics                  and the algorithm illuminate each other.  Because it exploits                   this link to the fullest, the course has only one prerequisite                  physics course, and thus is taken by students as early as their                 freshman year.  The course 1) excites and attracts students at                  an early stage in their college careers, 2) allows appropriate                  use of computation throughout the physics curriculum, and 3)                    develops the student's physical insight.NSF grant funds are                     being matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
