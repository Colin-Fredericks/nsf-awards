 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports two anthropologists studying how                          pastoralists in Botswana think about and manage their \"life                     course\", meaning their family size, demographic composition, and                wealth.  The focus is on men's reproductive decisions in a                      society where cattle is the main form of wealth and the kinship                 system reckons descent primarily in the female line.  Using a                   combination of methods including in-depth interviews,                           participant-observation, time-allocation studies and small-scale                surveys, the researchers will learn how people manage their                     income, wealth, and family ties in order to attain their desired                level of security and well being.  Specific hypotheses to be                    tested are drawn from evolutionary theory.                                                                                                                      This research is important because we must understand men's                     reproductive goals and strategies in order to manage the growth                 of population.  Studies like this one provide case material for                 theory development to allow scholars to predict the impact of                   policies designed to limit population growth.",
