 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the study of photo-induced reactions of                   molecules adsorbed on supported metal catalyts.  Photochemistry                 of adsorbates on supported metal catalysts will be monitored by                 infrared absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and UV-Vis                  reflectance spectroscopy.  Photodissociation of chlorinated                     hydrocarbons adsorbed on Ni/aluminum oxide surfaces will be the                 first candidates for study.  The wavelength dependence of the                   photodissociation process will be investigated in order to                      elucidate the mechanism involved in the surface photochemistry                  and to demonstrate whether a significant red-shift in the                       photodissociation threshold of the adsorbed molecule exists, as                 is found for single crystal metal surfaces.  The extension of                   photo-induced surface chemistry from single crystal metal                       surfaces to supported metal catalysts is an important step in                   determining the feasibility of utilizing transition metal                       photo-assisted catalysis in chemical synthesis and processing.                  Of particular interest is the possible development of decom-                    position catalysts for halogenated hydrocarbons and other                       hazardous wastes.  The research planning grant will be used to                  assemble the necessary apparatus and perform preliminary                        experiments on the wavelength dependence of the                                 photodissociation of methyl chloride adsorbed on Ni/alumina.                    %%%                                                                             Research Planning Grants enable women who have not had prior                    independent Federal research support to develop a competitive                   research project.  This project involves the photochemistry of                  molecules adsorbed on supported metal catalysts, an area of                     great significance in chemical synthesis and processing, and in                 hazardous waste control.",
