 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a US-French collaborative research                      project in condensed matter physics.  The US investigators                      are: Dr. Robert Thorne, Cornell University, Dr. Joseph Brill,                   University of Kentucky, Dr. Guebre Tessema, Clemson University,                 and Dr. T. M. Tritt, Naval Research Laboratory.  The French                     counterparts are: Dr. Pierre Monceau, Center for Research on                    Very Low Temperatures, Grenoble, and Drs. J. Rouxel and M.                      Sargent from the Laboratories of Solid State Chemistry in                       Nantes and Rennes.                                                                                                                                              Charge density wave (CDW) conductors are among the richest                      systems in condensed matter physics, exhibiting collective                      charge transport with many analogies to superconductivity and                   remarkable dynamical effects associated with disorder and                       many degrees of freedom.  The goals of this project are 1) to                   prepare new and improved materials, 2) to understand the                        elastic anomalies associated with CDW pinning, and 3) to                        understand the stress-induced density wave transition in bi-                    metallic selenides.  The project will be divided into three                     parts as follows:  1) Poor material quality has been a major                    obstacle to progress in understanding CDW systems.  The                         research groups at Rennes and Nantes have great expertise in                    preparing novel inorganic low-dimensional conductors, while                     the Cornell group has been developing methods for preparing                     higher purity crystals of the most widely studied CDW                           conductors.  A collaboration between these laboratories is                      proposed to prepare crystals with improved purity and                           morphology, and to identify and explore other promising                         materials systems.  2) The highly anomalous electromechanical                   properties of CDW conductors are poorly understood.  High-                      sensitivity elastic modulus measurements in high magnetic                       fields and ultrasound measurements are proposed by the Kentucky                 and Grenoble groups to examine the role of the CDW amplitude,                   normal carrier screening and CDW-phonon interactions in these                   properties. 3) A novel stress-induced metal semi-conductor                      phase transition and non-ohmic conduction have recently been                    discovered by the Clemson, Rennes and Grenoble groups in the                    quasi-one-dimensional conductor tantalum-molybdenum selenide.                   In collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory, X-ray and                  magnetotransport studies in stressed crystals are proposed to                   establish the nature of the low-temperature density wave state.",
