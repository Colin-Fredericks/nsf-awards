 "awd_abstract_narration": "During software development, programmers employ a range of                 different program representations, including pseudocode, data flow              diagrams, finite-state automata, control flow charts, and many others.          Programmers may also create their own custom representations or                 languages to express their particular approach to a problem.                    Conventional development environments force programmers to translate            these different paradigms into a single textual representation that             the computer can understand, and to translate between this                      representation and their conceptualizations during coding, debugging,           and maintenance.  Multiparadigm development environments offer the              opportunity for programmers to work directly with their                         conceptualizations, to work with a program using whatever                       representation is most natural; such environments eliminate the need            to perform mental translations between programmer concepts and                  executable code.                                                                     The proposed research is to test the validity of multiparadigm             programming by designing experiments to answer the following kinds of           questions:                                                                                Does it make programs easier to design or code?                                 Does it make programs or designs easier to understand?                          Does it simplify the process of enhancing existing programs                     to increase their functionality or their performance?                           Does it make it easier for programmers to track down and                        eliminate bugs?                                                                 Do software developers prefer it?",
