 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central limit theorem is the most fundamental result in                mathematical statistics.  It states that the partial sums of a                  sequence of independent identically distributed random variables                with finite variance can be normalized so that they converge in                 distribution to a normal law.  In the case of infinite variance,                convergence is still possible, and the limit is either normal or                a nonnormal stable law.  For random vectors it is known that                    similar results hold, but there does not yet exist a practical                  method for construction of the norming operators.  The principal                investigator intends to develop such a method.  This work will                  bring the existing theoretical results on multivariable                         generalizations of the central limit theorem one step closer to                 practical applications.                                                              The principal investigator will work in the area of                        mathematics concerning limits of random vectors.  This research                 is in the center of the field of probability and mathematical                   statistics.  The principal investigator is working at a small,                  liberal arts college, and this award is being made via the                      Research in Undergraduate Institutions program.",
