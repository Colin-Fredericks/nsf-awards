Laboratory activities are being created with emphasis upon                      modern data analysis and graphical techniques, student                          projects, case studies, technology, and innovative teaching                     practices that treat statistics more as a laboratory science                    and less as a subject for lectures.  This project is producing                  a cohesive collection of laboratory units for students of                       introductory statistics, along with reference, assessment and                   implementation manuals for instructors.",
