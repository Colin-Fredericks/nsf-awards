 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research award supports a graduate student's                  study of the cultural construction of nationalist ideology by the               Puerto Rican middle class.  Focusing on the Puerto Rican                        Institution of Culture, the project will interview activists,                   intellectuals, and politicians to trace the relationship between                institutional settings and the development of nationalist thought               from about 1955 to the present.  Methods used include interviews                with key persons, archival studies of books, pamphlets and                      newspaper articles on language and cultural icons representing                  Puerto Rican national identity.                                                                                                                                 This research is important because nationalism is an enduring                   force in the relations between groups at a sub-national as well                 as an international level.  Understanding how one well-defined                  group has evolved its self-definition will help understand how                  groups in general define themselves in distinction to others.  It               is especially appropriate now that the Columbus Quincentenary is                drawing near.",
