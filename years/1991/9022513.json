 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the topic of dexterity enhancement by                    macro/micro bilateral manipulation.  Macro/micro bilateral                      manipulation refers to the use of a force interpreting master-slave             manipulator to provide a human operator the capacity for dexterous              micromanipulation.  Micromanipulation refers to any manual task                 requiring control of motions and forces well below normal                       physiological resolution.  The most obvious applications for macro-             micro bilateral manipulators (MMBM) are as assistive devices for                microsurgery and microassembly.  This project addresses both                    theoretical and experimental aspects of MMBM.  Its goal is to                   understand and describe the features of MMBM behavior that lead to              optimal dexterity enhancement.  This is accomplished by examining               a class of tasks in which the MMBM behaves as a hand tool.                      Specifically, this project studies the effects of using the tool                to match operator and environment impedances, and of using it to                reshape the the environment's impedance, compensating for the                   effects of physical scaling laws.  A high performance MMBM will be              developed which will be characterized by four degrees of freedom,               direct drive, master and slave manipulators, a multi-processor real             time control system, and a microscope, camera, and monitor for                  observation of the slave manipulator and microenvironment.  The                 apparatus will be used to perform a series of psychophysical                    experiments to assesss dexterity.",
