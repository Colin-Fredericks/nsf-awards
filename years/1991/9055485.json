 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, sponsored by the Commonwealth Partnership, a                      partnership of twelve liberal arts colleges and universities                    in Pennsylvania, is a three year Biology initiative,                            starting April 1, 1991.  The purpose of the initiative is to                    enhance student interest and achievement in science by                          promoting the professional development of secondary biology                     teachers through school/college collaboration.  The                             initiative will (1) update teachers' knowledge of recent                        advances in biology; (2) engage teachers in laboratory                          investigations/research techniques; (3) help teachers                           improve instructional effectiveness; (4) foster collegial                       relationships biologists at secondary and college levels:                       (5) develop participants abilities to be professional                           leaders; and (6) support ongoing professional development                       programs.                                                                                                                                                       In the summer of 1991, 120 outstanding secondary biology                        teachers from Pennsylvania and surrounding states (DE, MD,                      NJ, OH, and WV) will attend 3-week residential institutes at                    five host campuses.  Laboratory and classroom sessions will                     update and deepen participants' knowledge in cell and                           molecular biology.  Applications sessions will focus on                         applying new materials and approaches in the classroom and                      on means of extending selected institute outcomes to over                       3600 colleagues.  Over the next two years, outreach                             activities and professional development programs will                           support classroom implementation and staff development                          activities at the local level.                                                                                                                                  During the third year of the initiative, teams of                               participant master teachers will conduct seven extended                         workshops (nine days) for 140 secondary biology teachers, so                    as to provide an in-depth transfer of knowledge and                             experience gained through the program.                                                                                                                          An amount equal to 208% of NSF costs has been provided as                       cost sharing.",
