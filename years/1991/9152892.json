 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Washington is initiating a major program to                   improve entry-level science courses.  A major goal, as stated                   by the University Provost, is improvement of laboratory                         courses, and the requirement that all students enrolled in the                  lecture course shall also take the corresponding laboratory                     course.  The program in Physics is addressing both issues:                      improvement of thelaboratory courses, and preparing for                         increased laboratory enrollment.  The Physics plan begins with                  improvements in the mechanics laboratory experiments in                         introductory courses.  Faculty and staff who are participants                   in this project have been working for the past few years                        developing computer-based experiments that provide new                          opportunities for students to investigate motion in one and two                 dimensions with much more accurate and versatile tools than                     were previously available.  The experience to date with lab                     sections where these experiments were tested shows that                         students are able to investigate a much wider range of                          phenomena with a deeper understanding of the concepts of                        motion.  NSF support is being utilized to match the University                  funds provided to purchase workstations (PC 386/SX) and two                     motion digitizing devices: a video system and optical encoders.                 These elements are being integrated in a \"motion measurement                    station\" and form the backbone of a laboratory measurement and                  analysis system.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds                    from non-federal sources.",
