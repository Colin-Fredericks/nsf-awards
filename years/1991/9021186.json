 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spalangia cameroni is a small wasp which lays its eggs in                  the pupal stage of house flies.  This research focuses on the                   ability of female S. cameroni to manipulate the offspring sex                   ratios (the proportion of sons) they produce in response to the                 size of the host (fly) in which the offspring is laid.  Females                 lay a greater proportion of sons on small hosts than on large                   hosts.  An effect of host size on wasp offspring sex ratios has                 now been found in more than forty species of parasitoid wasps in                thirteen different families.  This research will address two                    areas for which there is currently very little information:  how                manipulation of sex ratio in response to host size affects a                    mother's success at reproducing and how mothers assess host size.                    Species of Spalangia have been released in poultry houses                  and stables to control pest flies, especially house flies.  Use                 of such \"biological controls\" is becoming increasingly important                as the flies become resistant to more and more insecticides.                    Research on sex ratios is important in terms of being able                      successfully to rear large numbers of wasps for release.",
