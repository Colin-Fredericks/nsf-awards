 "awd_abstract_narration": "The description of human anatomical growth and development is a                 longstanding interest of physical anthropology.  Not only is this               of interest vis a vis modern humans, but also as a means of                     describing the altering patterns of growth which have occurred                  over evolutionary time.  The complex changes in morphology which                proceed in the development of an individual are by no means easy                to describe or quantify.                                                                                                                                        The objective of this proposal is to characterize the growth of                 the basicranium and face of modern humans during fetal and early                post-partum periods.  This will involve two stages.  Data on the                alterations in the positions of a series of cranial landmarks                   will be generated through the use of computed tomography.  Once                 available, the data can then be analyzed using two mathematical                 models: Finite Element Scaling Analysis and Euclidean Distance                  Matrix Analysis.  These models will allow the PIs to more fully                 describe the alterations in the shape of the human skull over the               the fetal period.  Additionally it will be possible to start to                 describe the range of variation in normal human growth during                   this period.  Ultimately, such data will allow for discussion of                the variation in growth patterns seen throughout the primates.",
