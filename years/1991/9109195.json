 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the automated, static analysis of                    integrity maintenance rules within an active database                           environment.  An integrity maintenance rule is a rule that                      attempts to \"resatisfy\" a constraint by initiating corrective,                  state-altering database operations.  Rules that attempt to                      maintain conflicting or ill-specified constraints, however, can                 lead to cyclic and anomalous rule behavior.  This research                      addresses the theoretical aspects and implementation details of a               system for reasoning about the interaction between integrity                    maintenance rules for the purpose of automatically identifying                  provably safe, provably inconsistent, and potentially                           inconsistent rule behaviors.  The investigation is performed in a               deductive, object-oriented framework, using object logics to                    provide a well-defined syntax and semantics. The analysis of rule               behavior is based on current research on constraint                             satisfiability and integrity checking in deductive databases,                   using the truth maintenance paradigm to support user interaction                in and explanation of the rule analysis process.  The analysis                  process includes rules triggered by a set of transaction                        operations.  An important contribution of the research is the                   framework it provides for the correct execution of integrity                    maintenance rules in an active, object-oriented environment and                 for further refinement of execution models and run-time                         monitoring of active database rules, in general.",
