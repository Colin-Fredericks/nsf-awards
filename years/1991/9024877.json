This project aims at the               development of neural network architectures to explain how                      behaving individuals adapt successfully in real-time to                         constraints imposed by changing environments.  These                            architectures are capable of automatically adjusting in such a                  way that high level goals and plans continue to be realized                     despite changing circumstances.  Projects include an analysis of                how representations of 3-D space are autonomously learned in                    real-time.  It will address how such spatial representations can                be used in a larger system capable of learning to perform skilled               arm movement sequences, such as handwriting and visually-guided                 object manipulation.  The project will examine how planned action               sequences can be performed with a tool of variable length and                   mass, such as a pen or hook, without any further learning.  It                  will also study how a working memory can accomplish variable-                   rate, real-time short term memory storage of temporal order                     codes, such as codes for rapid speech, typewriting, and eye                     movement sequences.  This project will examine how a self-                      organizing hierarchy of temporal planning networks can compress                 the control of complex action sequences.  This will lead into how               a neural network architecture can learn to control approach                     toward a valued goal.  Finally, the research will address how                   complementary designs for sensory-cognitive learning systems and                cognitive-motor learning systems can be combined into a neural                  architecture that achieves the benefits of each type of design,                 without their individual limitations.  All of the projects will                 test the biological relevance of their neural architectures by                  computer simulations involving large behavioral and neural data                 bases.  They will also provide mathematical and computational                   analyses of these architectures to characterize circuit designs                 for adaptive, intelligent machines with new real-time processing                capabilities.  This project will provide basic insights into                    various levels of modeling of a user during human-computer                      interactions.",
