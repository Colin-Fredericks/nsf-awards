 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several problems on the subject of efficient sequential and parallel            algorithm design and development for computer algebra and symbolic              mathematics are considered.  The design of a processor-efficient                parallel algorithm for solving general and special linear systems over          an abstract, possibly modular, domain will be investigated, as well as          the design of an efficient sequential algorithm for computing the               characteristic polynomial of an implicitly given square matrix by a             function that computes the product of this matrix with a vector.  A             computer implementation of the Goldwasser-Kilian/Atkin Las Vegas                integer primality test will be enhanced by improving several auxiliary          number theoretical algorithms used in the test.  An algorithm for               factoring multivariate polynomials that are given by black box                  programs for their evaluation will also be implemented on a network of          workstations.  Furthermore, a search for more effective versions of             Hilbert irreducibility-type theorems will continue.                                                                                                             Research on two new topics that are related to emerging applications            of symbolic computation is suggested.  Motivated by geometric design,           an algorithm for computing the irreducible components of an algebraic           curve or surface given by its polynomial defining implicit equation             with floating point coefficients will be developed.  Attacked by                computer algebra methods, the problem is to compute the approximate             factorization of a rational bivariate polynomial.  Finally, branching           out of algebraic arithmetic, the usage of special function, such as             squareroots, exponentials, or logarithms, in the straight-line program          will be investigated.  In particular, a model of an analytic straight-          line program will be formulated, and a transformation theory for this           model will be investigated.",
