 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will upgrade the teaching of basic botanical                       science in the following courses: General Botany, Plant                         Ecology, Plant Physiology, and Independent Research. The                        endeavor is contingent upon equipping an undergraduate                          research laboratory where students can gather to plan                           research, carryout research, and then analyze data.                             Nine laboratory exercises are planned around the                                general theme of environment/plant-growth interaction.                          Three lighted environmental growth chambers, two                                incubators, and two laminar flow hoods are requested                            so students can grow plants, culture tissue, and                                germinate seeds under controlled conditions.  This                              collection of environmental control equipment will                              challenge students to design simple experiments,                                identify and control important variables, and then                              take meaningful measurements of photo-thesis. A drying                          oven and a digital balance are required for tissue                              processing.  A computer system is requested for data                            analysis and dissemination of research results. As a                            result of laboratory research using this equipment,                             hopefully more of our students will pursue botany,                              agronomy, or forestry at the graduate level.",
