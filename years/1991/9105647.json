 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the theory and design of                   structured vector quantizers for the compression and storage of                 analog sources such as speech, images, video, and music.  Vector                quantization is a class of techniques that holds significant                    promise for significant gains over recent compression techniques.               The difficulty with vector quantizers is the high degree of                     complexity involved in implementations. The focus of this project               is the development of a theory of reduced complexity vector                     quantizers.  Asymptotic quantization theory is to be further                    developed and used to analyze the performance of moderate to high               rate structured quantizers.  New methods for analyzing the                      performance of low rate quantizers are being studied.  The                      fundamental limits of performance versus structure are being                    explored.",
