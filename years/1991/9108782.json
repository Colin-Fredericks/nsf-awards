 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large - Eddy Simulation (LES) has served as a powerful tool for               turbulence research over the last two decades.  Computers with                  ever increasing speed and memory have also now made it possible                 to compute some turbulent flows using Direct Numerical Simulation               (DNS).  The research on LES of separated turbulent flows is                     proposed using parallel computing techniques.  The study will                   determine the turbulence statistics for these flows.  The                       proposed computation is very intensive in terms of memory and CPU               time and, therefore, implementation on a multi-processor computer               should lead to development of an efficient algorithm.  The study                will provide valuable experience and knowledge in the development               of numerical algorithms for LES of separated turbulent flows,                   which can then be effectively applied to even more intensive                    computations using DNS of similar flows.                                                                                                                        To approximate the spatial derivatives, a combination of fourth-                order finite-differences and spectral discretization will be                    used.  Time derivatives will be approximated by an implicit                     method.  The proposed methods will be implemented on CRAY-                      YMP8/864.",
