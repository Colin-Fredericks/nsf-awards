 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to study the transport, distribution and                      fate of chemical species in snow accumulations as they                          undergo metamorphism, melting and final release.  The                           research involves carrying out intermediate-scale and                           bench scale experiments of solute transport followed by                         field-tracer studies at a well-instrumented site to                             verify/confirm the mathematical solute-transport models.                        The investigator plans on conducting image processing of                        snow sections at the Center for Remote Sensing and                              Environmental Optics and plans to utilize laboratory                            facilities of the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research                                Laboratory, operated by the University of California,                           Santa Barbara.  His research also involves collaboration                        with the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering                        Laboratory in Hanover, New Hampshire.                                                                                                                           Results of the modeling, bench-scale and field studies are                      expected to improve our understanding of physical                               processes that control the movement of chemical solutes by                      water from melting snow.  The model expected to result                          from this research is expected to be utilized in                                developing strategies for predicting and managing the                           flush of acidic substances from accumulated deposits of                         snow.",
