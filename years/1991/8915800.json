 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the continued development of                 X-ray fiber diffraction techniques for structural analysis of                   macromolecular assemblies.  Typical such assemblies include                     virions, other nucleoprotein complexes, and cytoskeletal                        filaments.  The technique has been used for years and has already               played a key role in biology through, for example, the discovery                of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick.  However, there                    remain significant challenges with respect to sample preparation                and data analysis which these studies will address.                                  The use of X-rays to analyze molecular structure at the                    atomic level has been key to the recent, rapid advance in our                   knowledge of the structure of molecules of biological importance.               Much of the information has come from crystallographic studies in               which the subject molecules are crystallized from solution prior                to the analysis.  The use of fiber diffraction techniques                       eliminates the need for this difficult, time consuming, and often               impossible task.  However, because the methods for sample                       preparation and analysis of large biological molecules are as yet               poorly worked out, the fiber diffraction techniques has not been                widely adopted.  Progress in development of these methods can be                expected to play an important role in understanding the structure               of large macromolecular assemblies, many of which are poorly                    suited to analysis by more conventional analyses.",
