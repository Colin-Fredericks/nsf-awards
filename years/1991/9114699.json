 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in marine exploration technologies are                          revolutionizing capabilities to find and use submerged cultural                 resources such as historic shipwrecks.  The pace of these                       technological developments seems to have outstripped institutional              abilities to protect these resources.  This situation presents                  problems and value conflicts for marine scientists and engineers                who develop these technologies.  To understand and resolve these                problems requires consideration of the effects of technology                    development, the influence of legal rules and ethical norms, and                the structure of institutions such as markets, through which                    submerged resources are appropriated.  This project will employ                 theory and methods from the fields of ethics, law, economics,                   policy analysis, archeology, marine technology, and resource                    management to identify and characterize these factors.  It will                 include careful consideration of the ethical problems and                       responsibilities facing marine scientists and engineers concerned               about the impacts of new technologies they develop.  Research will              be undertaken by an interdisciplinary team, including advisors and              consultants, who will prepare papers and meet in planning sessions              and at professional society meetings as well as at a workshop                   planned for the summer, 1993.  The investigators will conduct a                 series of guided discussions in workshop settings to progress                   toward the development of widely accepted principles of                         professional responsibility in this field, curricula, and enlarged              public consideration of issues and values in protection and                     exploitation of marine cultural resources.                                                                                                                      The topic of this proposal is of high priority for Ethics and                   Values Studies.  The qualifications and track record of these                   investigators and their associated consultants and advisors are                 excellent.  The project provides an important test for theories and             methodologies to study issues of professional responsibility in the             development and dissemination of new technologies.  Results will                be useful for a wide range of individuals and groups.  The proposal             is recommended for support.",
