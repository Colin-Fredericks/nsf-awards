 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a 12 month long-term visit by                           Dr. Bharat B. Pant of the Solid State Electronics Center at                     Honeywell, Inc. to visit Japan for a cooperative research                       project involving Professors Kimihide Matsuyama and Ichiro                      Sasada of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Kyushu                    University and Professor Jiro Yamasaki of the Department of                     Electrical Engineering at Kyushu Institute of Technology.                       The proposed research involves modeling of the response of                      long strips of ferromagnetic film used in magnetoresistive                      sensors.  In these sensors a change in the sensed field                         produces a change in the resistance of the strip.  The                          research will be targeted towards two types of devices which                    use magnetic thin films, i.e. verticle Bloch line memory and                    thin film magnetic sensors.  The work proposed is of both a                     theoretical and computational nature.  The research will be                     carried out in conjunction with Professor Matsuyama's                           verticle Bloch line memory effort, Professor Sasada's work in                   the use of amorphous ferromagnetic ribbons as torque sensors                    and Professor Yamasaki's research into experimental investi-                    gations of the dynamics of magnetization in thin films.                                                                                                         The proposed research has significant scientific as well as                     practical value.  It will provide an important contribution                     to our basic theoretical and experimental understanding of                      the statics and dynamics of magnetism in thin films.                            Research resulting from this project could improve the                          ability to design thin film magneto-resistive sensors which                     are currently being studied for use in magnetic recording                       disk files. This could have an important economic impact on                     the disk drive industry.  All of the researchers are experts                    in their specific areas.  Both Kyushu University and the                        Kyushu Institute of Technology have ongoing experimental                        efforts taking place in this area.  Kyushu University is well                   advanced in experiments in vertical Bloch line memory and                       amorphous magnetic films.  Since Honeywell has no experimental                  effort in this area it is advantageous for Professor Pant to                    carry out his research at this University.  It is believed                      that the collaborations will be very successful and that this                   research will result in continued cooperation among the                         researchers.",
