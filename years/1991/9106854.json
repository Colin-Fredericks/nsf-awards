 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many organisms are currently showing alarming decline in                   abundance.  Among birds, species that build open-cup nests, breed               in North America and winter in the New World tropics (Neotropics)               are showing the sharpest declines.  The reasons for the declines                are not known.  To understand why populations are suffering it is               necessary to document survival patterns of (a) adults, (b) nests,               and, (c) independent young.  In addition, it is crucial that we                 understand what factors control and/or limit reproduction.                           Clutch size (number of eggs/nest) is the primary                           reproductive variable among birds, and all else being equal,                    individuals that lay the largest clutches and produce the most                  young should dominate.  It is therefore hard to understand why                  clutch size in some species of birds is smaller than the most                   productive brood size (number of young/nest).  Understanding this               phenomenon is important because reproductive processes have a                   direct impact on population dynamics, and therefore conservation                practices.                                                                           This project proposes to examine five hypotheses that have                 been put forth to explain why clutch sizes are often smaller than               the most productive brood sizes.  The Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus                tyrannus), a long distance migrant that winters in Amazonia,                    typically lays just three eggs but can raise 4 and sometimes 5                  young.  Experiments will be conducted to determine if small                     clutch size in kingbirds is related to (a) low food availability,               (b) high predation pressure on nests, (c) trade-offs with                       parental survival (i.e., raising many young increases adult                     mortality), (d) trade-offs with offspring survival (i.e., young                 fledged from large broods are smaller and have lower survival                   rates), or, (e) unpredictable increases in clutch size due                      intraspecific brood parasitism (i.e., the addition of eggs to a                 completed nest by a different female).  The results of this study               should help to clarify the puzzle of \"submaximal\" reproduction                  and also provide specific information on survival, reproductive                 success and population stability in the Eastern Kingbird.",
