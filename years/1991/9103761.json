 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Alexander terrane, SE Alaska, has the longest and most                 complete Paleozoic stratigraphy of the Alaskan terranes, with a                 stratigraphic and fossil record extending from the early Ordovician             to the Permian.  Many workers believe it began its long history in              the western \"Protopacific\" and only arrived in the vicinity of                  North America in late Mesozoic time.  Some preliminary faunal                   evidence indicates that the Alexander terrane has been closely                  associated throughout its Paleozoic history with the continent of               North America or possibly with eastern Siberia.  Faunas that have               been described include Silurian conodonts and brachiopods, Lower,               Middle and Upper Devonian conodonts and brachiopods, Mississippian              conodonts, and Pennsylvanian conodonts and brachiopods.  The faunas             described belong to the Old World Realm and show mainly Cordilleran             Region and Canadian Arctic affinities.                                               Although several of the faunas that occur in this                          fossiliferous sequence have been described, other Emsian, Eifelian,             Givetian and Mississippian conodont faunas and silicified Middle                Devonian and Mississippian brachiopod faunas have been discovered               but remain uncollected and undescribed.  Other fossiliferous                    Pennsylvanian deposits were discovered but not collected in 1988.               Continued work on these faunas will provide additional evidence                 concerning the terrane's origin.",
