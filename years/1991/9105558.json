 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cores and outcrop sections of Late Triassic, cycle platform                 carbonates in Hungary will be studied to determine why some cycles              record a transgressive (Lofer-type) succession, whereas other                   cycles record a regressive succession of facies.  Fischer plots                 will be used to define relative, long-term (3rd order) sea level                curves, which will be compared to published Late Triassic curves.               Cyclic sections will be examined using spectral analysis to define              if any dominant periodicities occur, and if so, what were likely                causes.  Computer modeling will simulate facies successions, cycle              stacking patterns, possible subsidence rates, likely amplitude and              periods of 3rd to 5th order sea level fluctuations, possible ranges             of sedimentation rates, and likely emergence times of cycles during             sea level lowstands.  The diagenesis of the succession will be                  studied to determine the relationship, if any, of high and low                  frequency sea level fluctuations to the diagenetic record preserved             the rocks, and the relationship of the numerous cycle-capping                   disconformities, and Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic unconformities.                 The work will define how faithfully a shallow carbonate platform's              sedimentary diagenetic record records its sea level and tectonic                history.",
