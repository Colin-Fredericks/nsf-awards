 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many threatened and endangered species are being maintained                in captive breeding populations, as a method for preserving them                for later reintroduction to native habitats.  Most captive                      populations have not only been initiated but also maintained in                 relatively small numbers, so a major concern of captive breeders                has been to reduce further erosion of evolutionary adaptability                 by maintaining maximal genetic variation in the populations.  The               effects of various breeding programs or even small population                   size per se on maintenance of genetic variation and/or                          evolutionary adaptability has not been adequately tested, so we                 really do not know which breeding programs are best to maintain                 evolutionarly viable populations.  Evidence has accumulated, for                example, that traits important to survival and reproduction in a                species may be affected by reduced population size in markedly                  different ways than traits currently being assessed in captive                  populations.  Specifically, using an experimental organism Dr.                  Bryant will investigate the impact of diverse breeding protocols                on the genetic variation, current health, and future adaptability               of captive populations.  Decisions regarding breeding programs                  are currently being made that will irreversibly affect the future               of endangered species, and this study will provide critical                     information to make appropriate decisions concerning the welfare                of these species.",
