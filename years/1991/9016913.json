 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research                         project in physical chemistry between Professor Mark A.                         Johnson of Yale University and Professor Tamotsu Kondow of                      the University of Tokyo.  They will collaborate on research                     into \"Chemical Reactions of Microclusters in Gas Phase and                      Interaction with Surfaces.\"  Over the past five years,                          physical chemists have become increasingly interested in                        molecular clusters as a tool to learn about the molecular                       aspects of condensed phase behavior.  Professor Johnson's                       group at Yale has developed methods based on mass spectrometry                  to isolate a specific number of solvent molecules around a                      solute molecule or reaction complex in order to study the                       size dependence of bimolecular and photo-initiated chemical                     processes.  A particularly interesting solute \"anion\" is the                    free electron itself, which has been studied through the                        accommodation of an excess charge by a collection of closed                     shell species.  The behavior of excess charges in polar media                   is of primary interest in radiation chemistry and is presently                  a focal point for experimental tests of current theories.                                                                                                       In previous work, the Yale group has discovered that several                    homogeneous systems possess strong absorptions near the                         binding energy of the excess electron, and that the excitation                  of these absorptions leads to fragmentation of the cluster                      rather than ejection of the electron.  Excitation near the                      binding energy means that the ejected electron would have                       very low kinetic energy and apparently cannot escape.  In                       Japan, meanwhile, Professor Kondow has been looking at the                      microscopic reverse process, the propensity of slow electrons                   to stick onto closed shell neutral clusters.  He has found                      that the slow electrons are efficiently attached to create a                    negatively charged clusterion.  It is likely that the two                       groups are carrying out complementary probes of the same                        essential physics and the goal of the cooperative project is                    to bring their efforts together to find a unified description                   of these phenomena.",
