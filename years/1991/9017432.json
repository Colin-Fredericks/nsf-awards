 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent explanations for the 1987 Caribbean-wide, mass coral                     bleaching event suggest that increased sea surface temperatures                 and enhanced ultraviolet light penetration were major                           contributing factors.  This project will investigate this                       hypothesis by conducting a series of experiments designed to                    partition the relative effects that UV  light and temperature                   have on coral growth and survivorship.  Appropriate experimental                levels for UV irradiation will be based on data derived from: i)                long-term UV flux measurements recorded in 1989, ii) preliminary                field experiments assessing effects of enhanced UV exposures, and               iii) UV measurements to be taken in clear tropical oceanic                      waters.  Experimental corals (Montastrea annularis and Agaricia                 lamarcki) held outdoors in UV-transparent acrylic aquaria will be               subject to two UV light regimes: 1) ambient UV flux, based on                   values obtained form prior long-term monitoring (controls), and                 2) maximum UV flux simulating the conditions that occurred during               the 1987 bleaching event (based on results from preliminary field               experiments identifying UV levels leading to coral stress, or on                treatment, corals will be subjected to three controlled                         temperature regimes: 28oC (control), 30oC and 31oC (peak or near-               peak temperatures recorded on reefs in the Caribbean during 1987)               for up to two months.  Treatment effects will be assessed by                    quantifying changes in colony color, chlorophyll concentration,                 zooxanthellae densities, mitotic indices and the concentrations                 of UV blocking pigments form coral tissues (using HPLC).  A                     second experiment will separate the differential, and combined,                 effects of UV-A and -B.  In addition to these experiments, we                   will establish a long- term UV monitoring program on Grand Cayman               Island, Cayman Island (site of the NOAA Aquarius habitat program)               and will relate these findings to observed intra- and                           interspecific differences in concentrations of UV pigments in                   reef corals along a depth gradient.  These data will constitute                 an important baseline that can be used to document yearly and                   decadal changes in UV light levels resulting from continued                     deletion of stratospheric ozone.",
