At a                time when major requests will be submitted for funding of new                   instrumentation, it has become apparent that scant documentation                exists on either the current or future needs of the structural                  biology community for synchrotron radiation.  The Structural                    Biology Synchrotron Users Organization proposes to conduct an                   intensive, two-day workshop in order to document and assess these               resources and needs and to advise the National Science Foundation               in its role as sponsor of structural biology research.  The                     proposed study group would 1) analyze data gathered from                        synchrotron users and synchrotron facilities that describe                      current resources and needs; 2) evaluate how scientific                         developments in the fields of genetic engineering, low-angle                    scattering, X-ray spectroscopy, x-ray microscopy,                               crystallography, computational technology, and instrument                       development affect structural biology today; 3) project future                  demand and capabilities; and 4) produce a document detailing                    these findings.  The document, reviewed by major scientists in                  these fields, would be available to funding organizations,                      government bodies and the scientific community to facilitate                    planning for the future.",
