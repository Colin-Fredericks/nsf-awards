 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will convene an interdisciplinary working group              of experts to analyze international regimes for managing regional               environmental resources.  The group would focus on the comparative              study of three cases:  the Great Lakes, the Baltic, and the                     Mediterranean.  The project would consider 1)  the role of                      scientific and other \"epistemic\" communities in regime-formation;               2)  the significance of ethical principles of stewardship;  3)                  the extent of the obligation to protect environmental public goods;             4)  the difficulties of overcoming pluralism; and 5)  the relation              between interantional regimes and international orders.  The                    working group would meet twice to plan and discuss papers which,                after critical review and revision, would serve as the basis of a               unified anthology.  The principal investigator would also write and             publish articules examining principles and practices of regime-                 formation among nations sharing a regional biological commons.                                                                                                  The topic of this proposal is of high priority for Ethics and                   Values Studies and Human Dimensions of Global Change.  The                      qualifications and track record of the investigator and proposed                members of the working group are excellent.  The project provides               an important test for theories about the development of                         international regimes for the provision of public goods.  Results               will be useful for a wide range of individuals and groups.  The                 proposal is recommended for support.",
