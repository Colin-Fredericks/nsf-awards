 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by two awards:  CTS 90-17692 to Purdue                   University and CTS 90-19612 to the Pennsylvania State                           University.  It is a study of the correlations between                          crystallite size, electrical properties, and catalytic                          behavior of highly dispersed silver particles on alumina or                     silica with particle diameters of 1 to 30 nm.  Experiments                      performed include solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance of                     adsorbed species containing carbon-13 on clean silver and on                    silver covered with oxygen-16 or oxygen-17; conduction                          electron spin resonance of the conduction electrons of small                    (less than 5 nm) silver crystallites; and isotopic transient                    kinetic studies of the  partial oxidation of ethylene (to                       ethylene oxide) over silver.  Previous studies have shown that                  well-dispersed, silica-supported silver catalysts do not                        sinter during partial oxidation; these catalysts also exhibit                   selectivities comparable to poorly dispersed silver/alpha-                      alumina catalysts, but at much lower promoter (dichloroethane)                  concentrations.  The detailed mechanism of ethylene oxide                       formation on silver is not known, but subsurface oxygen has                     been shown to be present and dynamically coupled to the                         reaction.  This study examines these phenomena under a series                   of controlled conditions.                                                                                                                                       The expoxidation of ethylene is a worldwide, very competitive,                  multibillion-dollar business; even modest improvements in                       process efficiency can have major impact on competitive                         position.  This work addresses this issue directly, and also                    has implications for other processes.",
