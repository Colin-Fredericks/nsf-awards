 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines factors leading to breakdown of protective               passive films on metals.  Sophisticated experimental methods are                used to follow the effects of hydrogen and chloride anions in film              deterioration.  Neutron reflectivity studies are carried out on                 mirror-smooth alloy surfaces of iron and iron-chromium alloys to                determine how hydrogen is distributed in the passive films and the              manner of breakdown of passivity in the films.  EXAFS (Extended X-              ray Absorption Fine Structure) analysis in conjunction with a                   photocathode proportional counter detector is used to determine the             presence of damaging anions in the passive film surface.  The                   effect of chromium content in iron alloys on passive film                       properties relevant to film breakdown is studied by anodic                      polarization in buffered borate solutions.  These data are                      incorporated into a model of the passive film breakdown process.                %%%                                                                             The passivity of non-noble metals and their alloys is the basis for             the successful application of metallic materials in technologies                where they are exposed to aqueous environments.  The special film               that forms on the surfaces of metals, the passive film, enables                 them to resist corrosion failure.  Detailed knowledge is needed on              how alloying constituents affect the structure, composition, and                electronic properties of passive films to improve the corrosion                 resistance of metal alloys.",
