 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GMI Engineering & Management Institute will initiate a three-week,          commuter Young Scholars project in the fields of Chemistry and Physics          for 30 students entering grade 9.                                                                                                                               The selected students will participate in hands-on science activities           involving chemical analysis and measurements, environmental chemistry,          polymer science, lasers, holography, and investigations of the                  properties of light.  Activities have been selected that are both               exciting and educational.  Participants will be divided into small              groups to conduct a short research project.  A portion of the three-week        workshop will involve career awareness activities such as question and          answer sessions with visiting scientists and engineers and field trips.                                                                                         The nine monthly follow-up activities will involve hands-on science             activities, dynamic speakers, field trips, and competitive events.",
