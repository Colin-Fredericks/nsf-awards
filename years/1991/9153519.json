 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is working to instill an interest in mathematics,                  science, and engineering careers in Hispanic high school                        students and enhance their mathematics and science skills.  One                 hundred and twenty high school students are participating in                    the project activities.  The students, after school, work in                    teams studying mathematics and science.  Each student is                        assigned two mentors, an engineer and an engineering student.                   The mentors serve as role models and resource persons to                        provide the students with realistic information about careers                   in engineering.  The students and their mentors meet as a group                 several times during the school year.  The students also visit                  and observe their mentors at work,  The project utilizes the                    methods and approaches of \"El Ingeniero\", a career                              education/mathematics and science enrichment program which has                  been identified as an exemplary program in \"Changing America:                   The New Face of Science and Engineering\", the final report of                   the Task Force on Women, Minorities, and the Disabled in                        Science and Technology.",
