 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal for the first three years' research in my lab is to                    establish Arabidopsis as a useful system for the biochemical and                genetic analysis of ribosomal gene regulation.  Ribosomal RNA genes             comprise 8% of the total Arabidopsis genome.  We have isolated                  numerous ribosomal RNA genes from an Arabidopsis thaliana genomic               library, and are looking for RFLP's that map to the intergenic                  spacer in potential regulatory regions.  We have putatively                     identified the transcription start site by S1 mapping, and have                 noticed a duplication of the start site sequence further upstream               in the intergenic spacer.  Future work will determine if these                  duplicated sequences represent spacer promoters, which have never               been described in plants but are present in many other organisms.               We will also look for sites of transcript 3' end formation to help              localize potential terminator sequences in the arabidopsis spacer.              To test the activity of potential cis-acting elements, such as                  promoters and enhancers, we will construct ribosomal minigenes                  whose transcripts can be distinguished from the endogenous                      ribosomal gene transcripts in transient expression assays.  Once                the assay is optimized, we will attempt to determine if spacer                  repeat sequences enhance transcription, as in Xenopus and mouse.                We will also examine the effects of auxin on specific initiation by             RNA polymerase I.  Finally, we will screen Arabidopsis genomic and              cDNA libraries for the plant homolog of the vertebrate RNA                      polymerase I transcription factor, UBF.                                                                                                                         These studies are aimed at establishing the relationship between                ribosomal gene organization and biochemistry in Arabidopsis with                other, better species as a prelude to genetic analyses that can be              undertaken in plants.***//",
