 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the State University of New York,                  Stony Brook to continue a summer program designed to immerse a                  small group of undergraduate students in an active research                     environment spanning the areas of behavioral and cognitive                      neuroscience, psychophysiology and the experimental study of                    decision, choice and self-control.  The goal underlying this                    initiative is to introduce students who are not currently                       involved in a laboratory research program to state-of-the-art                   psychological research in some of the most interesting and                      important areas of experimental psychology.  This program is                    intended to foster interest in, and an appreciation of,                         scientific research, especially for those students who might not                otherwise have an opportunity to participate in this type of                    activity.  Students will participate in an intense eight-week                   \"hands-on\" research experience where, in addition to learning                   specific laboratory skills, they will be exposed to all phases of               the research process.  They will also receive academic counseling               and have access to a variety of support services.  Undergraduates               will conduct independent research projects in one of eleven                     active research laboratories in the Department of Psychology.                   They will be closely supervised by faculty but will be encouraged               to take as much responsibility as possible for these projects.                  To supplement the laboratory experience, a variety of group                     activities are planned such as visits to other research                         laboratories, laboratory meetings, \"brown bag\" lunches, seminars                and a mini-symposium, that will broaden students knowledge of                   contemporary psychology.  These activities are designed to                      facilitate student interactions with the faculty mentors, as well               as provide opportunities to share experiences with one another.",
