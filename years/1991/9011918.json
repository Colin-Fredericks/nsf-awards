The                    organization of STEDT is by semantic fields, ultimately yielding                a thesaurus of the proto-lexicon.                                                                                                                                    During the first grant period (1987-90), vast databases of                 ST lexical and etymological material were created, incorporating                over 110 published and unpublished sources (some solicited by                   questionnaire).  As of January 1990, the database contained over                75,000 quality-controlled records.                                                                                                                                   The first fascicle of STEDT (to be completed by the end of                 1990-91) is devoted to body-part terminology.  Several hundred                  etyma have already been provisionally reconstructed in this key                 semantic area, most for the first time.  As the basic work of                   database creation and management is perfected, the rate of                      fascicle production will accelerate.                                                                                                                                 The STEDT project is an excellent training groud for                       students of SE Asian linguistics and computerized lexicography.                 The P.I. regularly conducts training seminars on historical                     semantics and comparative reconstruction.                                                                                                                            This work sheds light on ancient cultural patterns and                     thought-processes, and on long-standing puzzles about genetic vs.               contact relationship in East and Southeast Asia.  The STEDTS                    software will be readily adaptable for etymological work in other               language families.",
