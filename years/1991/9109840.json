 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to determine and analyze how family             obligations influence the job mobility of women.  In recent years,              it has become recognized that job turnover is an important                      criterion for career success.  A certain amount of early career                 turnover is regarded as beneficial because it can lead to finding               a lucrative job, but too much job change may indicate that workers              are failing to invest in job-specific skill that enhance their wage             growth.  Surprisingly, little is known about the extent to which                women change jobs, let alone how their mobility is affected by                  fertility decisions.   This research is important because it will               shed light on one of the factors that may account for persistent                male-female wage differentials.                                                                                                                                 To accomplish the research objectives, data from the National                   Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experiences will be analyzed,              primarily via the estimation of discrete-time proportional hazard               models.  The analysis will reveal how various measures of fertility             and past career interruptions influence the job-to-job hazard rate              as well as the nonemployment-to nonemployment hazard rate.  In                  addition, the characteristics of women's career interruptions will              be described, and the personal characteristics of women who                     interrupt their careers will be compared to the characteristics of              those who work continuously.  Special emphasis will be placed on                race and cohort differences in turnover behavior.",
