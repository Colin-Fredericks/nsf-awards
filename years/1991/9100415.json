 "awd_abstract_narration": "NorthWestNet originated as a six state network for                            supercomputer users.  In three years it has increased from 10                   connected sites to over 50 sites with varying levels of                         connectivity.  In the third year of the orginal award, the                      directors of the Northwest Academic Computing Consortium                        undertook a strategic planning  process to evaluate NorthWestNet                and set a course for the next 5 years.  The plan is to extend                   NorthWestNet to a much wider user community to include all levels               of higher education, primary and secondary school districts,                    researchers in the business and non-profit world, and the                       education comunity in general.                                                                                                                                    Continued funding will enable NorthWestNet to expand                          membership; move toward becoming a value-added service-oriented                 network; add new users within the current membership; and hire                  professional executive management.   NorthWestNet will hire a                   professional executive director to assist in implementing the                   strategic plan which includes the generation of five times the                  dues revenue of the immediate past fiscal year.***//",
