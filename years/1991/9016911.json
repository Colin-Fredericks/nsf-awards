 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a two year cooperative                          project on metal catalysts, between a group from Department                     of Chemical Engineering, University of Delaware, lead by                        Professor Bruce C Gates and a group from the Department of                      Chemistry, University of Tokyo, Japan, lead by Professor                        Yasuhiro Iwasawa.  Metals are some of the most important                        catalysts used in technology, and the common form of the                        catalyst used in practice consists of small metal particles                     dispersed on a high-area support.  These metals, however, are                   non-uniform in nature and therefore difficult to understand                     fully. This project will involve the bringing together of two                   complementary approaches to the investigation of metal                          catalysts developed by the teams in the US and Japan, namely                    the single-crystal surface science approach, and the surface                    organometallic chemistry approach.  The catalysts to be                         studied will be made from several precursors on single                          crystals of MgO and Mg with a few layers of oxygen.  These                      catalysts will then be converted to rhenium subcarbonyls,                       intended to be isolated mononuclear groups, pairs of these                      groups, and ensembles of three of these groups, respectively.                   Finally the samples will be treated to remove the carbonyl                      ligands and reduce the metal with minimum perturbation of the                   nuclearity.  The structures at each stage will be characterized                 using a number of physical methods including scanning tunnel                    microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and ultrahigh vacuum                          techniques.                                                                                                                                                     Both Professor Gates and Professor Iwasawa are highly                           competent scientists with reputations for being innovators in                   catalyst design and preparation.  This project should yield                     precise structural information characterizing the highly                        dispersed metal entities, as well as the metal support                          interface, and hopefully the results will demonstrate the                       relationship between the structure and catalytic properties                     of these materials.",
