 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regulation of sister-chromatid segregation in Drosophila will               be analyzed.  While disjunction of sister-chromatids is common to               both meiosis and mitosis, in meiosis sister-chromatid separation                occurs in meiosis II and is inhibited in meiosis I.  Thus there are             functions that promote sister-chromatid cohesion as well as those               that lead to disjunction.  Two Drosophila mutants, mei-S332 and                 ord, result in precocious sister-chromatid separation in meiosis                I of both males and females, providing a key to unraveling this                 process.  We have recently isolated additional alleles of each of               these loci; these alleles reveal that the mei-S332 is not required              to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion until anaphase I, after the               kinetochore has duplicated.  The new alleles of mei-S332 will be                analyzed for their effects on sister-chromatid segregation in                   meiosis and mitosis using genetic and cytological approaches.  The              mei-S332 gene will be cloned and its products identified and                    characterized.  Since an interesting possibility is that the gene               encodes a component of the kinetochore which functions to maintain              cohesion or the two duplicated halves, the cytological location of              the mei-S332 gene product will be analyzed.                                                                                                                     Sister-chromatid disjunction is central to the ordered segregation              of chromosomes is eukaryotic organisms.  The information resulting              from this work will allow us to understand better fundamental                   aspect of inheritance.",
