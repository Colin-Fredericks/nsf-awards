 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant cells differentiate in a position dependent and not a                     lineage dependent manner. They must, therefore, receive signals                 that inform them of their position within the multicellular                     organism and differentiate accordingly. The nature of the                       signals, their origin, and how they are transmitted is largely                  unknown. This research project will address these questions by                  examining how cells in the three layers of the shoot apical                     meristem maintain functional coordination over the course of                    meristem ontogeny. To achieve this objective Dr. Sussex proposes                to generate graft chimeras between wild type tomato, Lycopersicon               esculentum and tomato carrying mutations that affect specific                   stages of vegetative or reproductive meristem function. The graft               partners will also differ in cell layer autonomous markers by                   which each of the three meristem layers in the chimeras can be                  identified. The specific aims are: 1) To determine for each of                  the chimeras whether function and organization of the meristem at               a specific stage of its ontogeny is cell layer autonomous or                    depends on interactions between the cell layers, 2) Where such                  interactions are fund to occur to determine whether the signal                  originates in one specific layer and if so whether the position                 of the layer in the meristem is important.                                      %%%                                                                             The results of this investigation will provide specific instances               in which interactions between cell layers of the growing tip of a               plant are required for normal development and how those                         interactions contribute to development of the plant.",
