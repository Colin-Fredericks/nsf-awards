The goal is to establish a mesoscale network near Urbana                        consisting of three radars in a triangular array with an average                separation of approximately 20 km.  The addition of the new                     facility to the two radars already operating near Urbana will                   allow measurements of a number of parameters important in the                   evolution of mesoscale and microscale meteorological systems,                   including horizontal and vertical velocities, vorticity,                        divergence, shears, deformation, and the vorticity equation                     tilting terms.  The special capabilities of the spaced                          antenna/IDI system will also allow a study of the scattering                    mechanisms responsible for the echoes, the tilts of isentropic                  surfaces, and possibly the small-scale vorticity, divergence, and               vorticity tilting terms on a spatial scale of 30-50 m, i.e., the                scale characteristic of the separation of the antennas in the                   spaced antenna system.  The addition of a third radar to the                    network increases the information that can be derived and the                   number of studies that can be carried out by more than a factor                 of ten over what can be achieved with either one or two radars.",
