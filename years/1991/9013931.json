 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs developed a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer                    (GC/MS) under NSF grant ATM-8717861 and coupled it with                         isotopically labeled internal standards  for near real-time                     determinations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), dimethyl sulfide (DMS),                 carbon disulfide (CS2), and carbonyl sulfide (OCS) in the                       atmosphere.  In its present configuration, the GC/MS can be used                for measurements in relatively mild turbulent conditions such as                those encountered in the marine mixed layer.  These four compounds              can be measured with an average frequency of one per 8 minutes                  using simultaneously collected air samples.                                          The PIs plan to modify the sample handling and calibration                 systems to achieve response times of three minutes with detection               limits of 1 part-per-trillion by volume (pptv) with a precision of              1 pptv.  They also plan to install a turbomolecular pump that will              allow uninterrupted use of the GC/MS under the turbulent conditions             that occur in aircraft in the continental boundary layer and on                 ships under a wide range of sea states.  With this added capability             the GC/MS could be used to conduct atmospheric chemistry                        experiments which are designed to evaluate fluxes and budgets of                sulfur gases, to measure ocean-atmosphere exchange of sulfur gases,             to study sources and sinks of OCS and CS2, and to study chemical                transformation of dimethyl sulfide and sulfur dioxide and their                 role in affecting climate via aerosol formation in the troposphere.",
