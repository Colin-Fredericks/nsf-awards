 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Unified System Design Laboratory (USDL) to support an                         innovative approach to the upper level systems courses in                       computer science is being developed at University of North                      Carolina Asheville.  The current operating systems course                       sequence is based upon a paradigm that includes formal                          laboratory sections in the core classes and project oriented                    laboratory work in the elective classes.  The new laboratory                    allows the  extension of this paradigm to all of our upper                      level systems classes: Operating Systems, Networking, and VLSI                  Design.  Entry level color Sun workstations and a file server                   are used.  The USDL permits building upon the faculty's special                 expertise in each of these areas.  Wayne Lang has taught a well                 attended VLSI Design class at UNCA for four years.  Dean Brock                  developed a popular networking class taken by most of the                       graduate students at UNC-Chapel Hill.  Mark Boyd created UNCA's                 unique Operating Systems sequence and has worked with formal                    laboratories for the past six years.  UNCA has a rich history                   of support for undergraduate research, and a high percentage of                 graduates are attending graduate school.  The USDL provides                     experience for the students that will enhance their                             undergraduate research opportunities and encourage them to                      pursue further research upon graduation.",
