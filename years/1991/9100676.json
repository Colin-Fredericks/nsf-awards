The conference                      is planned as a comprehensive meeting with presentations                        scheduled in various disciplines of this multi disciplinary                     field, from chemistry of synthesis, through chemistry and                       engineering of processes, to physio-chemical and                                engineering aspects of polymer properties and                                   applications.  Representatives of seven European countries,                     Japan, P.R. of China, Canada, the U.S.S.R., and the U.S.A.                      are expected to meet with scientists from 25 Indian                             institutes who are currently active in polymer science and                      engineering for exchange of informations on recent                              developments and research problems.                                                                                                                             Scope: The conference is expected to enhance the research                       and educational activities of Indian institutions in the                        field of polymers.  It is also expected to  increase                            collaboration between U.S. and Indian scientists.  A                            proceeding of the conference and recommendations for future                     collaboration are expected to result.",
