Hoddeson and Westfall are continuing their exploration of the              critical features in the emergence of large-scale research in                   America through a close examination of the founding and first                   decades of operation of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory                   (Fermilab), the base of the world's highest energy particle                     accelerator.  As the United States prepares to enter a new phase                in the pursuit of science on unprecedented scales, e.g., the                    Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), the Human Genome Project and              the Manned Space Station, deeper understanding of the workings of               \"big science\" through detailed case studies becomes especially                  vital.  Through research in documents, supplemented by oral history             interviews with leading participants, the project is designed to                examine historical problems of big science, including:  the effects             on research of increased size, scope, and cost of facilities and                experiments;  changes in research resulting from much larger                    working teams, budgets, and time-scales;  the role of theoretical               models and computer analysis in experimentation and accelerator                 building; and the influences of geographical concentration,                     national and international politics, and economic policy.",
