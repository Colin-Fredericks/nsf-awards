 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is found at neuromuscular                  junctions, where its function is to depolarize muscle cells at                  the postsynaptic membrane, triggering muscle contraction.                       Depolarization occurs by channel opening, induced by the binding                of acetylcholine, to allow the passage of small cations.                        Neurotoxins inhibit the binding of acetylcholine, by binding a                  large portion of the acetylcholine receptor  -subunit, blocking                 at least part of the acetylcholine binding site.  The best                      structure for the receptor is at the low resolution level of 22                 A, using a combination of electron microscopy and x-ray                         diffraction data.  NMR spectroscopy for this large membrane bound               complex is clearly beyond current technological capabilities.                   However, peptides corresponding to the portion of the receptor                  near the acetylcholine binding site have been found to bind   -                 bungarotoxin with about the same affinity as the entire   -                     subunit binds this neurotoxin.  It is proposed here to determine                the structure of these peptides bound to  -bungarotoxin, using                  two and three-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, including                           heteronuclear techniques with selective isotopic labeling.  This                will allow for the first time the details of the interactions                   between a portion of the acetylcholine receptor containing the                  major determinant of the neurotoxin binding site, and at least                  part of the acetylcholine binding site to be determined.  By                    studying complexes formed with different peptides the relative                  importance of specific binding interactions between   -                         bungarotoxin and the acetylcholine receptor, will be clarified.                 This will contribute to the general knowledge of non-covalent                   interactions between proteins.",
