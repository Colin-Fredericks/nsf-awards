 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using the (VLA) Very Large Array, the astronomers at Northwestern               University have obtained radio observations of the galactic center              region and prominent galactic HII regions that constitute some of               the largest continuum and spectral line data bases in radio                     astronomy.  A large amount of optical spectroscopic data has also               been acquired in the application of high signal-to-noise techniques             for the study of interstellar and Quasi-Stellar Object (QSO)                    absorption lines.  The image processing tasks required for the                  optimum reduction and analysis of these enormous data sets make the             ready availability of substantial computer capabilities essential.              This award will provide support for the acquisition of a mini-                  supercomputer (IBM RS/6000 powerserver 540) and its peripherals so              that mosiac images of some of the most complex regions of the                   galaxy can be made and numerous other research projects                         currently being carried out by the PIs be facilitated.                          Northwestern University has already contributed over $130,000 in                purchasing computer equipment for the PIs and will contribute                   another $47,000 to this facility.",
