The commitment of the        project staff, the National Association of Biology Teachers, EDVOTEK            Corporation and school districts toward that end is strong and extends          beyond                                                                          the life of the grant in order to make this a self-sufficient program           educationally and financially.                                                                                                                                  Four sets of \"mini-courses\" per year will be offered to secondary school        teachers of biology and chemistry from both public and private schools          in                                                                              conjunction with national, state and regional meetings (e.g. NABT, ACS)         as well                                                                         as special courses such as AP biology and chemistry training program.
