 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will carry out modeling and diagnostic studies to                   investigate the interannual variability and predictability of the               monthly and seasonal average circulation of the atmosphere.  The                long term goal is to investigate the predictability of the                      coupled ocean-atmosphere-land system.  To accomplish this                       objective, the strategy is to utilize realistic models of the                   individual components (atmosphere, ocean, and land surface                      processes) to carry out sensitivity and predictability studies,                 first to examine the predictability of each component separately,               and ultimately to examine the predictability of the coupled                     interactive system.  The PI and his group will continue their                   ongoing research on the predictability of space-time averaged                   atmospheric circulation to establish a physical basis for, and                  demonstrate the feasibility of dynamic extended range                           forecasting.                                                                         To accomplish the above objective the PI will continue to                  improve the NMC-derived atmospheric general circulation model so                that its ability to simulate the annual cycle and interannual                   variability including space-time fluctuations is further                        improved.  He will also use this model in conjunction with real                 observed states of the global atmosphere and global boundary                    conditions at the earth's surface to investigate the                            predictability of the regional space-time averaged circulation                  of the atmosphere.                                                                   This research is important because it will provide a readily               applied basis for improvements  in operational weather and                      climate prediction models.",
