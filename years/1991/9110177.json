The main objective of             this research is to design and build reliable distributed systems by            software testing and recovering from processor failures.                        The analytical component of this research is expected to provide a              better understanding of the issues involved and suggest different               approaches to testing distributed programs and crash recovery.  The             experimental component of this research effort involves the                     implementation of several techniques and is expected to result in the           development of software tools for the above mentioned problems in               distributed computing systems.",
