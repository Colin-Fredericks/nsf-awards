 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides modest partial support to facilitate a sabbatical           visit to Denmark by Professor Jeffry V. Mallow of Loyola University             of Chicago.  His host will be Professor Karin Beyer of Roskilde                 University Center, Roskilde, Denmark.  They share a background in               physics and a research interest in the sociology and psychology of              science education, particularly the phenomenon of science avoidance             by women.  Dr. Mallow developed a clinic based program to address               science avoidance, while Dr. Beyer's work has emphasized the                    modification of classroom interactions.  Semester-long reciprocal               visits will permit them to pursue joint research in this important              field.  They plan to examine data already acquired on the respective            techniques, and to investigate which aspects are transferable to                the school system of the other country.  They also intend to                    investigate the development of a hybrid technique combining the                 science anxiety clinic with classroom intervention.                                                                                                             Gender differences in the decision to study science and mathematics             have been recognized for many years.  There is a substantial body               of literature now on reactions to mathematics, but less so for the              sciences.  Some progress has been made in seeking ways to change                girls' avoidance of science.  Recognition and study of the problem              has become internationalized, and results of the research have                  begun to find application both in the classroom and in the training             of teachers.  The collaborators in the curent proposal are among                those actively seeking to advance this field, where exchanges of                experience have proven to be quite valuable.",
