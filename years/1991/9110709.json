 "awd_abstract_narration": "A well-designed database must balance security-control and                      operational efficiency.  Consequently, the principal objective is               to develop a design theory for multilevel databases unifying                    security (access-control and inference-control) and efficiency                  aspects in a dynamic environment.  This project identifies the                  key constraints imposed by these aspects and formulates practical               guidelines for database design.  Emphasis is placed on data                     dependencies fundamental to inference-control and anomaly-                      elimination. The approach employed deals with a lattice-theoretic               relational model enforcing database security by abstracting or                  clouding sensitive information in user views.  The model uses                   \"contexts\" constructed from natural equivalences. Contexts induce               multilevel relations capable of holding abstraction, and support                a rich and highly secure data language.  Contexts also                          incorporate semantics in abstraction; this helps balance user                   convenience and database security.  The lattice-theoretic                       framework simplifies the investigation; classical design issues                 are also readily mapped to their multilevel formulations.  The                  investigation also focuses on an Oracle implementation of the                   security-control model.  Special consideration is given to                      implementing the query-handling facility.  The results of this                  research will have a significant impact on the design of                        databases handling abstract information, and particularly those                 supporting AI and expert systems applications, as robust and                    efficient security-control is a critical issue facing database                  and knowledge-base designers.                                                     //",
