The                          organizers are Dr. Carl McDaniel, Department of Biology,                        Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Dr. Rod W. King, Senior                    Principal Research Scientist, Commonwealth Science and                          Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Plant Industry,                        Canberra, Australia.  The workshop will bring together U.S.                     and Australian experts who represent the full range of                          research on flowering, that is, the reductionist, molecular                     genetic approach and the physical, whole plant approach.                                                                                                        The workshop will contribute to improved understanding of                       seed plants, the most important modern-day group of organisms                   in terms of energy capture and agriculture.  Collaborative                      interaction between Australian and American scientists is                       expected to be strengthened by exploring areas where future                     cooperative research may be beneficial.",
