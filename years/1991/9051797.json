 "awd_abstract_narration": "An experiment will be developed to enable students,                        especially physics majors, to be better prepared to study                       resonance processes at the intermediate and advanced levels by                  providing experience with a simple resonance system as part of                  an introductory course in experimental physics.  The system to                  be studied is the classical damped, driven harmonic                             oscillator:  a mass and spring system acted upon by an                          external damping force and a periodic driving force.  The                       equipment required includes a linear air track system, a                        specially designed loud speaker and a sine wave                                 generator/amplifier.  The air track provides a nearly                           frictionless surface upon which the mass-spring system                          oscillates.  The speaker, driven by the sine wave                               generator/amplifier, provides a periodic driving force at                       frequencies in the 0.10-2.00 Hz range.  Damping is introduced                   by attaching ceramic magnets to the sides of the air track                      glider, producing eddy currents in the track as the glider                      oscillates.  Students will measure the period of free                           oscillations of the mass-spring system, the damping time                        constant, and the amplitude of forced oscillations as a                         function of driving frequency for varying amounts of damping.                   The experience gained will help students to relate the                          theoretical treatment of resonance in our physical mechanics                    course to a number of experiments in the advanced laboratory                    course, where resonance processes are investigated in depth.",
