 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns allocation in simple private goods                       situations such as assignment of transmission capacity in a                     computer network.  A strong case can be made that in such problems              (i) non manipulability (i.e., dominant strategies) is a very                    desirable property, (ii) replacing the requirement of Pareto                    efficiency with a fairness criterion is sensible - particularly                 since efficiency and non manipulability are inconsistent                        requirements, and (iii) local serial dictatorship is acceptable                 provided anonymity holds globally.  It has been shown that the                  serial social choice function satisfies these criteria.  This                   research is to characterize the class of mechanisms that satisfy                these criteria.                                                                                                                                                 This project is the point of departure for a systematic analysis                of strategy-proof mechanisms for allocating private goods. It                   represents an important and exciting direction in which to increase             our knowledge of allocation mechanisms and their performance                    characteristics.  Not only does the project promise to contribute               to the body of economic theory in a substantial way, it will affect             the ways firms and public bodies allocate certain scarce productive             resources (such as computer networks).",
