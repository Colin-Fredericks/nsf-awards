 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current reform movement in mathematics education                       emphasizes the importance of students constructing their own                    knowledge in an atmosphere  that encourages sharing of                          ideas, justification of mathematical assertions, and                            creation of shared meaning for the mathematics being                            learned.  Research has begun to shed light on the social                        processes by which this can occur, but has largely ignored                      questions of how mathematical structure is communicated,                        particularly at upper grade levels.  Issues of how both                         teachers and students view mathematics, especially the need                     for justification of mathematical assertions, also become                       critical at this level.  The purpose of this study is to                        investigate (1) ways in which language serves as a mediator                     of beliefs about mathematics; (2) ways in which mathematicl                     structure is communicated, particularly through use of                          metaphor and analogy; (3) how an appreciation for                               mathematical justification develops in classrooms; and (4)                      how new teachers are socialized into patterns of classroom                      discourse.  The study will be interpretive, the data                            consisting largely of fieldnotes, interviews and transcribed                    audiotapes of classroom discourse.  The research will                           suggest ways in which goals of the current reform movement                      can better be met, both by improving discourse patterns and                     by improving the ways in which new teachers adopt discourse                     patterns.",
