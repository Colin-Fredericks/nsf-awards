 "awd_abstract_narration": "The brain is composed of many different nerve cells (neurons)                   that interact through an intricate series of circuits.  Proper                  functioning of the brain requires appropriate cellular wiring and               precise cell-to-cell interactions.  This communication between                  cells is achieved by the release of a transmitter chemical from                 one neuron that acts at a specific site, the receptor, on the                   target neuron.  The distribution of several different                           transmitters and their corresponding receptors have been mapped                 in the central nervous system.                                                                                                                                  One important receptor in the brain mediates the actions of gaba-               aminobutyric acid (GABA).  GABA is the major inhibitory                         transmitter in the brain, and the binding of GABA to its receptor               decreases the activity of the target neuron.  Although the                      receptor is present on at least 30-40% of all neurons in the                    brain, its exact structure and regulation remain unknown.  Recent               studies indicate that it is composed of multiple protein                        subunits, each of which is actually a family of closely-related                 proteins.  These studies suggest that multiple GABA receptors,                  composed of different subunit subtypes, may exist in different                  brain regions.                                                                                                                                                  To gain a better understanding of GABA receptor structure and                   function, a number of studies are being performed.  First,                      studies on the adult brain will determine whether all GABA                      receptors are identical or whether receptors having different                   subunit compositions are localized at different sites.  Second,                 studies on the developing brain will investigate whether receptor               composition changes as the nervous system matures.  Finally,                    additional studies will investigate how cell-cell interactions                  regulate GABA receptor composition.  Knowledge of this complex                  and prominent receptor system will enhance our understanding of                 normal brain function.",
