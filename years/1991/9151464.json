 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment in this project is being used in a popular upper                  division physical optics laboratory course; \"Modern                             Experimental Optics.\"  Students are performing fourteen                         experiments in physical optics, interferometry, optical                         modulation and heterodyning, laser physics, and time-resolved                   spectroscopy, but the equipment is mostly generic, having wide                  utility beyond these particular applications.  Individual items                 of significant cost include two optical tables, a home-built                    nitrogen laser, an electro-optic modulator, and a fast analog                   data-acquisition system.In general, the experiments require                     students to assemble an optical system from components, see                     phenomena they have read about, and use the phenomena to make                   a physical measurement.  For example, in a study of Fabry-Perot                 interferometers, the students start with a HeNe laser, a few                    mirrors and lenses, mounts, and a piezo-electric translator and                 come out at the end with a sensitive reflectivity value for the                 low-loss mirrors used in the interferometer.Most of the                         experiments are based on the Principal Investigator's                           experiences as a postdoc and in industry; in general, they have                 not been discussed in the literature.  Consequently, they are                   being published as papers or laboratory manuals for those                       projects which turn out to be most useful as teaching tools.",
