 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal mission of this research program is the continued                 focus on the discovery and development of new stereoselective                   organic reactions. Specific areas include the development of                    new methods for the generation of metal enolates (especially                    under mild conditions), the exploration of new stereoselective                  reactions of chiral enolates, and the development of new aldol                  reaction concepts. In complementary studies, the focus is on                    the develpoment of a new family of chiral bidentate ligands and                 the evaluation of their utility in a selection of important                     catalyzed asymmetric processes. Such processes include metal                    carbene transfer to olefins and dialkylsulfides and                             enantioselective aldol addition and acylation reactions                         proceeding through metal enolates and metalloenamines. In all                   such reactions where stereochemical information is relayed,                     either from catalyst or one of the reaction constituents in the                 creation of new stereogenic centers, a serious effort is                        expended to understand the fundamental stereochemical control                   features of the process under study.                                                                                                                            %%%                                                                                                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                  Division will support the research of Dr. David A. Evans of the                 Department of Chemistry at Harvard University. The research is                  in the general area of synthetic methodolgy and is focussed on                  the discovery and development of new stereoselective organic                    reactions. Chemical synthesis provides the capacity to produce                  new organic architecture, and chemical reactions are the                        irreplaceable tools of those engaged in this discovery process.                 Consequently, the synthesis activity is a critical discipline                   which continues to have important impact upon the fields of                     medicine, biology, and materials science. The research in this                  award is at the forefront of that activity by developing                        controlled procedures for the preparation of chiral molecules                   by both stoichiometric and catalytic processes.",
