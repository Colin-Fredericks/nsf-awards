 "awd_abstract_narration": "With a Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers from the                National Science Foundation, Dr. Christine Gall will continue to                elucidate the role of activity-dependent neuronal gene expression               in shaping the functional properties of neuronal circuities in                  response to experience.  By using a combination of sophisticated                neuroanatomical and molecular biological techniques, Dr. Gall                   discovered that high frequency electrical stimulation in defined                neuronal pathways alter the expression of genes encoding specific               neuropeptides and neurotransmitters.  For example, she has found                that this activity induces changes in the genomic expression of a               major subclass of glutamate receptors within the hippocampus, an                area critical for the formation of memories.  She is now                        beginning to unravel the clues about the mechanisms of                          neuropeptide regulation by examining more rapid, transcriptional                events.  With this award, she will concentrate on understanding                 how this physiological activity alters the regulation of                        immediate-early genes which then encode the proteins that mediate               neuropeptide regulation.  Moreover, she extend the anatomical                   work by developing electrophysiological approaches which enable                 her to examine the functional consequences of the change in gene                expression within specific neuronal circuitry for neuropeptides,                neurotransmitters and, more recently, neurotropic factors.                      Indeed this Award will permit her to explore the significance of                her seminal finding that nerve growth factor is modulated in                    adult mammalian brain.  This work leads to a more thorough                      understanding of the functional organization and the plasticity                 of the nervous system.",
