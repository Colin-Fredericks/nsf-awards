 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study various questions                    involving open boundary conditions for problems in wave                         propagation and fluid dynamics. The topics of investigation                     include absorbing boundary conditions for dispersive waves, open                boundary conditions for the shallow water equations in a rotating               reference frame, and absorbing boundary conditions for the                      velocity-stress formulation of the elastic wave equation.  This                 work is motivated by the fact that many physical problems are                   defined on spatial domains that either are unbounded or are so                  large that it is not feasible to compute numerical solutions over               the entire region.  In such situations, it is necessary to                      truncate the domain.  One then encounters the problem of                        finding boundary conditions to impose at the artificial                         computational boundary.                                                              The development of such boundary conditions is the subject                 of this research.  This work is expected to have applications to                computer modeling of several kinds of physical phenomena,                       including large scale motions of the atmosphere and oceans,                     seismic waves within the earth, and waves on the surface of                     water.  For example, suppose that an oceanographer wants to model               the circulation in an ocean.  One possibility is to compute the                 relevant physical quantities on an array of grid points                         distributed over the entire ocean.  If the circulation is needed                for the entire ocean, this is what must be done.  On the other                  hand, if the circulation is needed only on a relatively small                   portion, such as the continental shelf, then the above procedure                is far too costly.  Instead, one would prefer to compute the                    circulation only on the region of real interest. In such a                      computation, the region is bounded partly or entirely by a                      boundary that is \"open\" instead of physical.  Telling the                       solution what to do at such a boundary is rather tricky, and an                 incorrect choice of boundary conditions can seriously corrupt the               solution that is computed. The goal of the present research is to               develop effective open boundary conditions for the physical                     situations mentioned above.  Open boundary conditions for seismic               waves would be useful to geophysicists who use seismic methods to               search for geologic structures that could contain petroleum, and                open boundary conditions for water waves would be useful to                     engineers who study the effects of wave actions on coastal and                  offshore structures.",
