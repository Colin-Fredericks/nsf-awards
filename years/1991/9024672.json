 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the curation and inventory of a                       collection of parasitic wasps in the Trichogrammatidae                          (Hymenoptera).  Wasps of this family are internal parasites of the              eggs of other insects.  73 genera and about 650 species have been               described.  They are among the smallest insects known.  Because                 they commonly parasitize the eggs of several agricultural pests,                these wasps have been of particular interest to biological control.             Problems associated with their small size, however have deterred                entomologists from building requisite collections.  Consequently                the taxonomy of the family is in an extremely unsatisfactory state.             Species identifications are impossible for most genera.  Generic                identifications also are problematic.  Because the family is so                 poorly sampled, diversity, geographic distributions and biological              characteristics remain unappreciated.  A large collection of                    Trichogrammatidae has now been put together at the University of                California at Riverside.  The collection is world wide in coverage              but stresses North America.  It, by far, represents the largest                 holdings of this group in North America and probably the world.                 Support will be used to inventory and curate the collection.  The               largest portion is in alcohol and in peril because of the fragile               nature of these wasps.  Specimens require immediate removal and                 critical point drying.  Computerization of collection data also is              planned and will make specimen information available to other                   researchers.  A large and well curated collection is required to                encourage future taxonomic studies of this poorly known but                     important family of insect egg parasites.",
