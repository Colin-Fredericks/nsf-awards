 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Mary Pohl                and her colleagues will conduct two field seasons of                            multidisciplinary research on Albion Island, Belize.  The goal of               the work is to understand the development of Mayan civilization                 in this area.  Previous work has demonstrated that in several                   regions of Middle America, prehistoric peoples have used a form                 of wet field agriculture.  This involved building systems of                    raised fields with intervening canals which provided the right                  amount of water for crop production.  Such fields are known to                  exist in the Albion region.  Dr. Pohl and her collaborators will                use aerial data to delineate such features.  This will be                       combined with research on the ground to provide ground truth.                   Soil cores will also be collected to trace changing landforms                   over time and archaeological excavations conducted.  On this                    basis, it should be possible to determine how environment changed               over time, how agricultural practices were altered accordingly,                 and how this affected Mayan social organization.                                                                                                                The Mayan Indians of Middle America developed complex societies                 with writing, monumental architecture and centralized political                 hierarchy.  They were able to subsist in tropical areas which can               today support only very small populations.  Archaeologists wish                 to understand both how these groups subsisted and what processes                led to the emergence of such complex civilizations.  Evidence of                such a development can be observed on Albion Island.  The                       exceptional preservation of remains from ancient agriculture in                 water-logged conditions there, together with a wealth of previous               archaeological research, makes this an ideal place to examine                   such issues.  Pohl believes that fluctuations in sea level were                 responsible for changes in which farmers were forced to invest                  additional labor in their fields.  This, in turn, made them much                less mobile and ultimately dependent on elite military strength                 for protection of these improved lands.  This research will allow               her to evaluate this hypothesis.                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  It will increase               our understanding of how complex societies develop and provide                  data of interest to Mayan archaeologists.  It is also                           technologically innovative since it makes archaeological use of                 an advanced Geographic Information System.  Hopefully, it will                  serve as a model for future work in other areas.  Finally, the                  insights gained into Mayan raised field agriculture may prove of                use in developing new agricultural techniques third world areas.",
