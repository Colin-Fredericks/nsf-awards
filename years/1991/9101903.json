 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators will study problems in geometric               analysis that arise in the calculus of variations and mathematical              physics. These problems include the motion of level sets by mean                curvature, existence of multivortices of the electroweak theory in              a periodic cell, and boundary value problems for surfaces of                    constant Gauss curvature. In addition they will study various                   problems associated with minimal surfaces such as rigidity and                  symmetry loss for periodic minimal surfaces.                                         Many problems in mathematical physics may be framed in terms               of a minimization problem. For example, given a closed curve in                 space one might want to find a surface with average curvature equal             to zero and which has the given curve as its boundary. This problem             may be restated as the problem of finding the surface of minimum                area with the given curve as boundary. Such a surface occurs in a               physical setting as a bubble, for example, a soap bubble. This type             of problem is known as a variational problem.  The principal                    investigators will study these problems using techniques from                   analysis and geometry.",
