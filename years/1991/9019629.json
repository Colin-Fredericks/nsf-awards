 "awd_abstract_narration": "The final goal of the research is to establish                                  spectrophotometric pH measurements as a key analysis in the                     study of the oceanic carbon dioxide system.  The bulk of the                    work will be focussed on calibrating the dyes for use as pH                     indicators by direct reference to measurements using the highly                 reproducible hydrogen / silver-silver chloride cell.                            Additional work will be performed to assess the stability of                    the indicator dyes and the importance of impurities in                          commercially available chemicals.  Experiments will also be                     conducted to demonstrate that these pH measurements are                         thermodynamically consistent with measurements of dissolved                     inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and f(CO2).  Furthermore,                   an additional pH buffer for use in the electrometric                            measurement of oceanic pH, will be established.  Detailed and                   precise pH profiles will be obtained in the North Pacific Ocean                 in conjunction with the CO2 system measurements of NOAA                         personnel.  The proposed work entails measurements of                           spectrophotometric pH on each seawater sample analyzed by NOAA                  personnel for total inorganic carbon, CO2 partial pressure, and                 total alkalinity.  These measurements will be used to assist in                 long term NOAA investigations of oceanic-atmospheric CO2                        exchange and will also be used to verify the accuracy of pH                     determinations involving indicator dyes by demonstrating                        internal consistency in alkalinity, total CO2, pCO2 and pH data                 sets.",
