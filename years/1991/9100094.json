In particular the award                      will cover the activities leading up to and including a                         three-day conference and planning meeting to be held at the                     University of Arizona at which representatives of the                           participating universities and corporations will meet to                        develop detailed agendas for the exchange program.  Japanese                    representatives will also attend for one of the three days.                     The principal emphasis of the planning conference will be on                    defining an effective strategy for expanding American                           experiences in Japan.  The important goals of this consortium                   are as follows: 1) increasing the number of American scientists                 and engineers with firsthand experience in Japan through                        short-term and long-term research experiences in Japan; 2)                      involvement of scientists and engineers from industrial                         research labs; 3)access to more technically advanced facilities                 and equipment in Japan; 4) facilitating the rapid exchange of                   students within active research programs; and 5) expanding                      the exposure of young researchers to international research                     environments.  This program will contribute to U.S. policy                      goals of increasing access to Japanese research and development                 and sending more American researchers to Japan.  It should                      also make the decision to go to Japan easier for the individual                 researcher by providing a matrix of institutional backing and                   support so that their visits to Japan are seen as enhancing                     to the individuals' careers.",
