 "awd_abstract_narration": "An outstanding problem in biology is whether natural                       selection acts at levels other than that of individual organisms.               Selection acting on group characteristics may be important but                  the biological processes that give rise to it are poorly                        understood.  Behavioral decision-making, in which animals                       discriminate among alternatives using group as well as individual               properties, is a source of group selection that has never been                  formally investigated.  The proposed research will develop and                  analyze models of group selection caused by three common types of               behavioral decision-making:  (1) choice of flowers by insect                    pollinators; (2) female mate-choice, and (3) host choice by                     plant-feeding insects.  Detailed formulations of decision-making                behavior will be combined with quantitative genetic models in                   order to link the observable properties of animal behaviors to                  their short-and long-term evolutionary consequences.  This will                 provide the first analysis of a potentially-important form of                   group selection.  The results will identify those situations in                 which group-level selection can be expected and will yield                      predictions that can be tested in natural populations.",
