Langer, Director of the Institute for                              Theoretical Physics, University of California - Santa                           Barbara, and Dr. George M. Zaslavsky, Head of the                               Department of Analytical Studies, Space Research                                Institute, Moscow, U.S.S.R., have organized a cross-                            disciplinary program in Topological Fluid Dynamics that                         will involve pure mathematicians and astrophysicists as                         well as fluid dynamicists.  Leadership will be shared with                      Dr. Keith Moffatt of Cambridge University and Dr. Michael                       Tabor of Columbia University.  The Soviet delegation                            will include Drs. Alexander Chernikov and Michael                               Natenzon from the Space Research Institute and Dr. A.                           Mikhailov from the Landau Institute of Theoretical                              Physics.                                                                                                                                                        The principal activity of the Institute for Theoretical                         Physics (ITP) is to organize and operate research                               programs in which visiting scientists can interact over                         an extended period with a sizable fraction of the                               world's most active scientists in the research area.                                                                                                            An outstanding cross-section of leading topologists,                            theoretical and computational fluid dynamicists working                         on problems involving fundamental mechanisms of vorticity                       dynamics and turbulence, plasma physicists with expertise                       in problems of magnetic field topology and reconnection                         processes, and experts in Lagrangian chaos will meet                            from August - December 1991.  The participation of the                          group of Soviet scientists will enhance the vitality and                        international nature of this program.                                                                                                                           This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the U.S. and U.S.S.R. to combine complementary efforts                          and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and                         competence in the field of basic scientific research on                         the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of                            benefit.",
