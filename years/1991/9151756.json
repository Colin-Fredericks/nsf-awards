 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds from the NSF-ILI Program are being used for the purchase                  of an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer and the upgrading of                  a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer with a Headspace Sampler.                 These additions allow significant science curricular                            enhancement to a rapidly expanding Environmental Studies                        program which now interacts formally with all physical and life                 sciences at Dickinson College.  These enhancements benefit non-                 science majors in introductory courses in Environmental                         Science, Geology, and Chemistry; Geology and Chemistry majors                   and Environmental Studies certificate participants in                           intermediate-level, required and elective courses; and many                     students in these disciplines engaged in independent research                   and internships.  Focus of the project is on a more in-depth                    examination of the chemical aspects of environmental issues of                  increasingly great concern to students  and                                     society.Specifically, this project is incorporating this                        analytical component into the broader environmental curriculum                  at three levels:  A) Introducing a broader range of chemical                    data into the introductory level courses.  Heretofore, it has                   been impossible to deepen the discussion and questioning about                  prevailing chemical paradigms involving toxic metals and                        organic pollutants associated with local environmental                          degradation, the basis for most laboratory/field work at this                   level of inquiry.  B) Introducing theory, operation, and                        limitations of instrumentation at the intermediate level in                     innovative ways.  Small, well controlled, course-based                          environmental research projects are teaching the process of                     formulating a research project with the application of                          instrumentation to important real-life scientific problems.  C)                 Using instrumentation as tools for independent research and                     internships to solve more difficult, self-conceived                             problems.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-                 Federal sources.",
