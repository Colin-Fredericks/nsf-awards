 "awd_abstract_narration": "The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is valuable for studies              of gene expression because of its ease of culture and amenability               to classical and molecular genetic studies.  A genetically                      engineered inducible Ty transposable element, containing a                      functional HIS3 gene, it used to obtain insertion mutations in                  suitable yeast strains.  The insertions are identified in genetic               analysis by the ability of cells to grow without added histidine                (the His+ phenotype).  Isolated DNA carrying an insertion hybridize             to radioactive probes of the HIS3 sequences.  We plan to improve                procedures for obtaining mutants with single Ty insertions and for              demonstrating linkage of the His+ phenotype with the mutant                     phenotype.  Undergraduate research assistants at Allegany Community             College are assisting in developing a method for screening large                numbers of mutants by selection of a random sample of spores.  We               have obtained 2 types of mutations: (1) activation of a silent gene             which alters the control of mating type, resulting in sterility,                and (2) disruption of an essential gene, resulting in lethality.                I plan to involve students in isolating and characterizing Ty                   insertion mutations which disrupt genes essential for growth or for             the ability to synthesize specific nutrients, and for mutations                 which activate other cryptic or silent genes.",
