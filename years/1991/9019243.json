 "awd_abstract_narration": "A recently proposed model by the PI explains the uplift and                exhumation of high pressure/low temperature rocks in NE Venezuela               as the result of oblique subduction beneath an arcuate island arc               zone that was convex to the ocean.  The normal component of                     convergence is thought to cause arc-normal contraction structures               (folds, thrust faults) and the strike-slip component is thought to              cause arc-parallel transcurrent faults and shear zones.  An                     increase in curvature of the arc along strike may increase the                  strike-slip component of convergence, which in turn causes arc-                 parallel extension and thickness reduction.  The terrane is then                uplifted to maintain isostatic equilibrium.  On Margarita Island                and the Araya Peninsula of NE Venezuela, a Late Cretaceous                      subduction complex/forearc terrane was extended parallel to the                 Leeward Antilles volcanic island arc during its uplift and                      retrograde metamorphism.  The model outlined can explain the                    structural geometry of these uplifted subduction-related rocks, but             has not yet been rigorously tested.  This project will test the                 model by collecting data from North Central Venezuela for                       structural analysis and geothermobarometry.  Fission track                      40Ar/39Ar,                                                                      U/Pb, and fluid inclusion studies will be combined with the                     structural and geothermobarometric data to produce pressure-                    temperature-time-deformation paths for these rocks.  The results                of this study will greatly enhance our understanding of Caribbean               tectonics, and will give significant insight to the problem of                  rapid uplift of high pressure/low temperature rocks during                      collisional tectonic processes.",
