 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support research done by a number of                      principal investigators at the University of Chicago for a                      three year period.  Projects covered by the proposal fall into                  four main groups.  The first of these is concerned with three                   experiments at Fermilab focussing on neutral K meson decays to                  determine parameters appropriate to CP and to CPT violation,                    and to study rare K decays.  The second group studies very                      high energy proton antiproton annihilations using the Tevatron                  Collider Detector Facility (CDF), also at Fermilab.  Important                  goals of this experiment include the determination of the mass                  of the W boson and also limits on the mass of the illusive t                    quark which has so far evaded all attempts at observation.  A                   third group uses the OPAL spectrometer at the LEP accelerator                   at CERN to study decays of Z bosons.  The Z results are                         completely complementary to those of the CDF experiment in                      understanding the standard model, and any flaws that may exist                  in it.  The fourth group is in an experiment aimed at a search                  for decays of stopping muons, produced at the Los Alamos                        facility LAMPF, to positronphoton pairs.  Flavour changing                      decays of leptons, of which such events would be an example,                    have never been observed.  The standard model predicts no such                  decays.",
