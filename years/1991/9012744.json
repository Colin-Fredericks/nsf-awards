 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will facilitate cooperation between Professor Jay                    Martin of the University of Wisconsin, and Professors Tadashi                   Murayama and Takemi Chikahisa at Hokkaido University in                         Sapporo for one phase of the project.  The second phase                         involves collaboration between Professor Martin and Yasuv                       Takagi a senior researcher with the Central Engineering                         Laboratories of Nissan Motor Company, Ltd.  The computational                   research with Hokkaido University will focus on the development                 of an improved diesel combustion model for use in the                           multidimensional fluid-mechanics code KIVA-II.  The experiment-                 al research with Nissan Motor Company will involve the set                      up of a Particle-Image-Velocimetry (PIV) system for measuring                   the velocity fluid in the intake part of a reciprocating                        engine.                                                                                                                                                         Both studies are likely to contribute substantially to the                      design of advanced combustion engines in important areas of                     modeling and incylinder flows.  All of the researchers                          involved are highly qualified in their areas of expertise.                      Professor Martin has extensive experience in laser velocimetry                  in engines and a solid base in engine modeling using KIVA                       which is the most widely used code for incylinder engine                        modeling.  Both the University of Wisconsin and Hokkaido                        University are two of the world centers of diesel combustion                    research.  In addition, both Hokkaido University and Nissan                     Motor Company have an international reputation for quality                      research. It is anticipated that the close ties developed                       between the researchers will continue long after the formal                     project has been completed.",
