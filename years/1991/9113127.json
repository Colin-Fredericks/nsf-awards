 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although concrete structures are subject to large numbers of load               applications during the design lives, often involving stress                    reversals, and concrete is known to deteriorate both in strength                and stiffness under such repeated load applications, relatively                 little is known about its fatigue behavior, especially about the                damage accumulation in the low-cycle fatigue range.  It is proposed             to perform a comprehensive experimental test program to fill this               gap in knowledge, by measuring the energy dissipation capacity of               concrete with and without fibre reinforcement under uni-and biaxial             stress cycles.  The results of this experimental study will                     constitute a data base that will permit the development of damage               prediction tools and low-cycle fatigue analysis of concrete members             subjected to arbitrary load histories.  The proposed research                   contains also an analytical component with the objective of                     developing a theory to simulate damage accumulation in concrete and             to predict the fatigue life for variable-amplitude load histories.              As the Palmgren-Miner hypothesis of linear damage accumulation is               known to apply neither to metal structures nor to concrete, the                 experimental data to be obtained shall serve as a basis to                      construct a more accurate damage prediction model with which the                remaining life of concrete material can be determined.",
