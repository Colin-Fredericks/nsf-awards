 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is concerned with computer design tools                             (CAD/CAE/CASE) to support the total integration of \"systems                     engineering\" techniques into the electrical and computer                        engineering undergraduate curriculum beginning at the sophomore                 level.  It is an innovative approach that directly addresses the                need to improve the effectiveness of teaching design skills.  The               new tools provided a thread through eight undergraduate courses                 to link hardware and software, to connect classroom theory with                 laboratory experiences, and to emphasize the modeling aspect of                 design.  The courses affected extend from the sophomore through                 the senior years.  The equipment selected will provide high                     technology tools, both hardware and software, that use the state-               of-the-art modelling techniques.  The use of these tools will                   enable students to create through simulation and emulation,                     relevant and accurate models of real-world problems.  With the                  use of these educational tools we will be able to train effective               and productive engineers to cope with the quality and time-to-                  market issues that are major concerns in U.S. industry today.",
