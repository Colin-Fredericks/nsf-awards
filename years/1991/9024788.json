 "awd_abstract_narration": "Various problems in the set theory of the real line will be                investigated.  These problems involve independence and                          consistency results in axiomatic set theory.  This means that the               problem is to show that some particular statement cannot be                     proved from the usual axioms of set theory.                                          The main technique used is forcing.  The forcing method was                first invented by Paul J. Cohen in the sixties to show that the                 continuum hypothesis is independent of the usual axioms of set                  theory.  It has since been used to show many problems not only of               set theory, but also algebra, topology, and analysis are                        independent of the usual axioms of set theory.                                       Two areas of the set theory of the real line will be                       investigated.  The first area considers properties of Lebesgue                  measure and Baire category on the real line as well as some                     ideals which are less well known.  The second area is to                        investigate pathological or peculiar subsets of the real line.                       Understanding set theoretic properties of the real line has                obvious foundational significance.  It has also transpired that                 methods developed for this purpose inspire analogues which work                 in the context of theoretical computer science.",
