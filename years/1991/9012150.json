The project represents the next logical step in                         improving the quality of data collected by these widely used                    systems that are employed in studies of plankton distribution                   and ecology.  The dual beam bioacoustic sonar will enable                       scientists to correlate acoustic signals with animals                           actually captured in the net system.  Investigations of                         animal distributions will be improved by being able to modify                   ongoing sampling programs based on concurrent data, and study                   small scale distributions of organisms relative to what the                     net captured.  The data stream from the bioacoustic sonar                       plus the environmental sensors exceeds the telemetry                            capability of currently used electro-mechanical cables.  The                    new system will make use of rapidly advancing fiber-optic                       cable technology that can carry larger data streams.  The                       system will have broad application in planned ocean science                     research initiatives.",
