 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conventional refrigeration systems are limited in several                       respects:  neither vapor compression nor absorption coolers                     are efficient in small-scale units, and most vapor compression                  systems use freons (CFC's) that are harmful to the                              environment.  Thermoelectric cooler have been used in a small                   scale, applications, but also suffer from low efficiency.  A                    cooling device which offers higher efficiency in a small scale                  unit, and which avoids the use of CFC's, would be highly                        desirable.                                                                                                                                                      To meet these criteria, TDA plans to look at a novel cooling                    device using coupled electrochemical oxidation and reduction.                   After carrying out detailed thermodynamic calculations to                       define the system and the desired characteristics of the                        coupled reactions, they have identified a number of promising                   reaction sets.  However, detailed data on many of the                           desirable chemical systems are not available.  Accordingly,                     the objectives of the research are (1) to carry out                             measurements of the fundamental electrochemical parameters of                   redox couples that are potentially useful in such a process,                    and (2) to conduct a systems analysis to determine the                          performance of a device based on these reactions.                               Theoretically, the electrochemical cycle operates at the same                   Coefficient of Performance (COP) as a Carnot refrigerator;                      however, real equipment considerations will limit performance                   to about 40% of the Carnot limit.  The refrigerator has                         potential for several applications, including replacement of                    refrigerators with CFC's and small scale cooling such as a                      chiller for electronic components.  In Phase II they will                       construct and test a prototype cooling device using this                        approach.",
