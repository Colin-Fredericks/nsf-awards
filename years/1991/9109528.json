 "awd_abstract_narration": "An exchange network is comprised of people or other units such             as organizations interconnected in a group.  The participants are               occupants of positions in the network, and the connections between              any two participants or collectively in the group as a whole may                be exclusive or inclusive.  Inclusion occurs when two or more                   exchanges must be completed for a benefit to be realized from                   any of the exchanges.  This condition is in contrast to exclusion               which occurs when only one exchange must be completed for a benefit             to be realized.  Having to make many exchanges is seen as weakening             power or control.  The aim of this research is to examine inclusion             as a basis for power in exchange networks.  A series of experiments             investigates a variety of networks in order to quantitatively                   determine the joint effect of inclusion and exclusion and tests a               theory that predicts that the effect of inclusion increases with                the number of exchanges but is completely eliminated when exclusion             is also present.                                                                                                                                                     The study of the condition of exclusion has dominated research             on exchange networks.  This project will contribute to the                      understanding of power relations in exchange networks by                        systematically investigating the condition of inclusion.",
