 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal goal of this research planning project is to                 prescribe a performance evaluation environment that supports the                effective, efficient, and creative programming of parallel computer             systems.  Since the complexity of parallel computer systems makes               program performance evaluation and prediction difficult, tools                  employing the experimental method to observe, analyze, and display              system activity are essential.  Accurate insights about program                 execution, particularly on future large systems, are possible only if           innovative techniques are used in the areas of instrumentation, data            management, visualization, and knowledge engineering.  Within this              context, this project will study the relationships between properties           of parallel programs and properties of the performance representations          produced during execution on scalable multicomputer systems.  The               validity and utility of particular views and statistics as indicators           and predictors of program performance are to be investigated.",
