Research involves                                              development of a model describing                                               the interfacial region surrounding                                              particles in aqueous systems and                                                the conduct of experiments to study                                             the behavior of colloidal particles                                             in aqueous media with compositions                                              representative of fresh, estuarine                                              and marine waters.  The research                                                includes applications of knowledge                                              gained to environmental problems                                                that are associated with surface                                                and ground waters, and in treatment                                             processes for water and wastewater.                                                                                                                                                                                                             The presence of colloidal particles                                             in water negatively impacts its                                                 environmental quality and potential                                             usefulness.  These particles also                                               present a problem in conduct of                                                 processes to remove them from water                                             and wastewater.  Results of this                                                research are expected to improve                                                the engineering design of processes                                             and systems to remove colloidal                                                 particles from aqueous systems.",
