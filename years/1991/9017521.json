 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research             project in chemical process design between Peter Glavic, Z.                     Kravanja, of the University of Maribor and I. Grossmann of Carnegie             Mellon University is to develop a computer system to solve                      production problems in chemical processing.  The researchers propose            to develop a software model for optimal planning and scheduling of              multiproduct processes.  Dr. Kravanja and Dr. Grossman have                     conducted some preliminary work together.  They propose to develop              software which can be applied to environmental, energy consumption              and factory retooling and retrofit problems, and which can be used              as a teaching tool in engineering education.                                                                                                                    This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The award,                except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav             institution.",
