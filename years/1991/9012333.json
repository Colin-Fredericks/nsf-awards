 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical fluxes from the ocean's surface into the deep sea vary                 over the ocean in response to the supply of nutrients, the                      availability of light, and the dispersion of newly-produced                     material by local turbulence and sinking.  Funding is requested                 to continue the development of global scale models which                        integrate biological and chemical components into three-                        dimensional ocean general circulation models (GCM's) that                       simulate the major features on the ocean's physical forcing.                    Towards this end we have already developed a series of                          component models describing the upper ocean ecology and water                   column transformations, and carried out a first series of                       three-dimensional simulations in which these components have                    been included separately in ocean GCM's.  Our Atlantic Ocean                    GCM model of upper ocean ecology, while reproducing the gross                   features of ocean biology, such as the spring bloom, low                        productivity in the subtropical gyre, and high productivity in                  the equatorial region, has numerous problems, some of which can                 be traced to the GCM, and others of which are due to the                        ecology model.  We propose to carry out a series of new                         experiments with higher resolution, more realistic GCM's; and                   to work on the continued development of our ecosystem model,                    with the inclusion of 2 size classes of phytoplankton and                       zooplankton being our first priority.  We also propose to enter                 a new phase in our work of working closely with JGOFS                           investigators in analyzing the results of the North Atlantic                    Bloom Experiment, and planning future studies such as the                       Pacific Equatorial Experiment.  Our world ocean GCM model of                    water column transformations shows an improved fit to                           observations when the formation and regeneration of dissolved                   organic matter is included in addition to particulate organic                   matter.  In addition to continuing our effort to improve our                    understanding of the production and regeneration of dissolved                   organic matter in the water column (a process which will be                     greatly helped by additional measurements), we propose to                       proceed on development of a more detailed model of particle                     dynamics which makes use of the ecosystem approach we have                      employed in the upper ocean and the observational constraints                   obtained by reactive trace metals radioisotopes.  We also                       propose to complete an ongoing reanalysis of Redfield ratios                    which thus far suggests that as much as 1/4 of the organic                      nitrogen sinking below 1000 m may be getting denitrified.",
