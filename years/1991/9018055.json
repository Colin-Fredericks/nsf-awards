 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an investigation of transverse                          geologic structure within the Transantarctic Mountains                          (TAM), a major intracontinental mountain belt that developed                    along the crustal boundary between the subcontinents of East                    and West Antarctic.  The TAM appear to be a rift-margin                         uplift related to extensional tectonism within the Antarctic                    Plate during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic.  Offsets in the TAM                     suggest an along-strike structural segmentation analogous to                    that seen in other continental rift systems.  In contrast to                    other rift systems, however, there is no change in tilt                         direction between segments, and transverse structures in the                    TAM are associated with physiographic troughs that may                          represent tensional \"pull apart\" zones.  Kinematic analysis                     will establish the displacement direction(s) associated with                    these structures, and provide a test for models invoking                        extension and translation between East and West Antarctica                      during rift development.  Documentation of the positions and                    character of these transverse structures will provide a 3-D                     picture of the rift system that will constrain process-                         oriented models of rift development and TAM uplift.                             Comparison of TAM segmentation with that of other rift                          systems will serve to evaluate controls on along-axis rift                      propagation as continental lithosphere is stretched prior to                    breakup.",
