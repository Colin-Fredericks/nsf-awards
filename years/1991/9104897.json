 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two-part project to continue investigation of the                     sources and petrogenesis of Cretaceous flood basalts in                         Madagascar and the Deccan Traps of India.  It is proposed to                    complete study of Madagascan lavas and dikes, conducted in                      collaboration with A. Saunders and M. Storey (U. Leicester,                     U.K.).  Specifically the plan is: (a) to continue Nd, Pb, and Sr                isotopic analysis of a subset of 300 well-documented samples; (b)               for Mahoney to contribute to a planned 1991 field trip to the                   major remaining exposures in northern Madagascar; and (c) to                    conduct isotopic work on selected samples therefrom.  The second                focus of the proposed work is an isotopic (Pb, Nd, Sr) study of a               unique collection of near-primary picritic lavas and associated                 basalts in the northern Deccan Traps.  These samples are markedly               enriched in highly incompatible elements compared to the Western                Ghats formations.  However, their incompatible element patterns                 suggest that some are likely to be affected little by continental               material.  Also, because they may represent some of the earliest                eruptions in the Deccan, the plan is to obtain high-quality                     40Ar-39Ar dates (from R. Duncan, OSU).",
