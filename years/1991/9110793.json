 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to implement a new model for programming           scientific computations on distributed memory multiprocessors, called           lattice parallelism (LP).  LP is intended for scientific methods that           locally concentrate computational effort non-uniformly and                      unpredictably, for example, adaptive mesh methods.  It provides                 high-level operations to hide the low-level details of dynamically              manipulating elaborate, dynamic data structures.  The objectives of             the research are to gain a better understanding of lattice                      parallelism under realistic conditions; to apply it to scientific               applications, and to explore run-time optimization techniques.  The             implementation and evaluation of LP will be carried out on the Intel            iPSC/860, running a variety of application codes at our disposal.                                                                                               A novel feature of lattice parallelism is that it exploits the                  tightly coupled local structure present in non-uniform calculations             and so avoids high communication overheads.  This is significant in             light of the ultimate emergence of massively parallel distributed               memory multiprocessors, which are especially sensitive to the effects           of communication overhead.                                                                                                                                      This research will result in the development of a software tool for             reducing the effort required to parallelize full scale numerical                software by an order of magnitude or better.//",
