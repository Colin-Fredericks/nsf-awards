 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                 the Chemistry Division Professor Yarkony will investigate                       several problems in spin-forbidden and electronically                           nonadiabatic chemistry. These processes play a major role in                    determining the rate of a number of industrially important                      chemical reactions.                                                                                                                                             Professor Yarkony  will develop computer algorithms which will                  include: (1) the capability for determining relativistic                        wavefunctions using large scale configuration state function                    expansions based on quasidegenerate perturbation theory within                  the Breit-Pauli approximation, and (2) the use of analytical                    gradient methods for locating regions of significant electronic                 nonadiabaticity, that is, allowed, avoided and actual crossings                 of potential energy surfaces, and for determining derivative                    couplings in these regions.  He will consider nonadiabatic                      electronic quenching reactions such as that between Na+HCl                      which has been the object of recent experimental and                            theoretical studies. He will focus on the nature of the                         adiabatic-diabatic state transformations. Other areas to be                     investigated include: (1) photochemical dissociation processes,                 (2) a characterization of the global potential energy surfaces                  and derivative couplings for the He-H2 system, and (3)  a study                 of spin-forbidden dipole-allowed radiative decay processes in                   the molecules NO+ and O2+, which are candidates for energy                      storage intermediates in energy transfer in chemical lasers, as                 well as the molecules SiCl2, SiH2, and SiHCl which play a role                  in semiconductor fabrication through vapor deposition.",
