 "awd_abstract_narration": "Production and transportation control strategies for multiple                 plants in a vertically integrated company will be investigated,                 emphasizing settings with complicating factors such as setups                   (machine changeovers), transportation delays between plants,                    uncertain yields, and uncertain production lead times.  The primary             motivating example is the electronic industry.  The goal is to                  develop approaches to improve coordination so as to reduce the                  manufacturing response time while keeping transportation and                    production costs low.  Analytical models will be developed to study             groups of complicating factors, to understand their interactions,               and then to develop control strategies that encourage coordination              in view of these factors.  Project results will be used to                      appropriately adapt an existing production planning model at the                host department, to account for these factors.                                    This project addresses production control methodology for                     vertically integrated companies, is extremely relevant to the                   semiconductor and electronics industries, and has applicability to              a much broader range of problems.  The project furthers VPW program             objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance their                  careers in science or engineering through research, and to                      encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas through the              investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the host                   campuses.  In this project, the proposed activities which                       contribute to the second objective include:  teaching two lecture               courses (one undergraduate and one graduate), advising on projects              for Master of Science students, presenting at least one guest                   seminar, and informal mentoring and counseling and role modeling                (there are no full-time female faculty in the host department).",
