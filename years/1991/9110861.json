 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to provide analysis tools and                 techniques to support the evolutionary maturation of a software system          from an early prototype implementation used to explore requirements to          a robust, production implementation.  The approach taken is to first            develop automated analysis mechanisms for the generation of detailed            structural models for highly evolutionary or \"exploratory\" software             systems.  These mechanisms will then be applied to representative               software systems, and the resulting models will be analyzed both                individually and collectively for information that supports                     incremental improvements in structural robustness and reliability.              The tools and techniques will build upon prior experiences with type            flow analysis, a program analysis technique in support of exploratory           software development.  This research will yield new insight into the            phenomena of software evolution, new tools for automated support of             software development, and insights into the appropriate                         characteristics of languages for prototyping and production quality             implementations.",
