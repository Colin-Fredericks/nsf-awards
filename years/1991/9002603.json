 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Gregory R.                           Carmichael, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering,                  University of Iowa, to pursue with Dr. Min Sun Hong,                            Department of Environmental Engineering, Ajou University,                       Korea, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative                      research on the long range transport of air pollutants in                       the Pacific Rim region around South Korea.  The research                        plan includes observation and modelling components.                             Background measurements of aerosol, ozone, and oxides of                        nitrogen and of sulfur will be obtained at Cheju Island                         located south-southwest of the Korean peninsula.  Comprehen-                    sive modelling analysis of the long range transport of                          pollutants and their impact on the environment will be made.                                                                                                    Chemicals released into the atmosphere can have many adverse                    impacts on the environment including local air pollution                        such as smog, regional problems such as acid rain, and                          global problems including the reduction of stratospheric                        ozone and global warming.  South Korea's location between                       China, to the west, and Japan, to the east, provides an                         ideal location to study the transport and chemical charac-                      teristics of the east Asia plume.  This research is of                          interest and benefit to the United States because it has now                    been well established that neither pollutants nor their                         effects are confined to the locations where the chemicals                       enter the atmosphere.  The two investigators are outstanding                    scientists in the field of the project who have a record of                     successful collaboration in prior research.  This project is                    relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative                        Science Program which seeks to increase the level of                            cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers                    through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                          skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems                    of mutual benefit.  Dr. Hong's participation in the project                     is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation                    (KOSEF).",
