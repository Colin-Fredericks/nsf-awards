 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical objects of the same category often come in two                     varieties: regular ones, which are easy to describe or classify,                or have some \"nice\" properties; and the irregular, more elusive                 ones.  A good example are homomorphisms on C(\u01310, 1!) into some                  Banach algebra:  one would think of the continuous ones as                      regular, the discontinuous ones as irregular.  It happens (as in                the above example) that the existence of irregular objects in a                 given category can neither be proved nor disproved, at least                    with the help of only universally accepted mathematical tools (as               formalized in axiomatic set theory).                                                 The research of this project focuses on three methods to                   extend the toolkit of mathematics in a way that allows                          elimination of certain irregular objects:                                            -    the Axiom of Determinacy, which says that there are no                          irregular (i.e., undetermined) games of sorts,                             -    the Open Coloring Axiom, which says that certain                                irregular partitions do not exist,                                         -    assumptions that mathematics takes place in certain                             \"harmless forcing extensions\" of the constructible                              universe.                                                             The relative strength of these methods is to be determined and                  possible improvements and new applications of them sought.",
