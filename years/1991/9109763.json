 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior work indicates that people are often biased toward omissions.             This proposal examines this bias.  One hypothesis is that people                ignore the consequences of inaction and they compare the                        consequences of action to the status quo.  This research also                   examines the conditions under which omission bias occurs, its                   effect on judgements about public decisions (such as global                     warming), its relation to other effects such as the status-quo                  effect, the sunk-cost effect and the extra-cost effect;                         individual differences in omission bias and related biases, how                 people might be debiased, i.e., persuaded to ignore the                         distinctionh between acts and omissions when it is irrelevant and               why they sometimes resist such persuasion.  Questionaires will                  be given to students, museum visitors, and citizens who are                     particularly concerned about the issues addressed.  The results                 could inform discussions of public policy concerning a variety of               issues, such as environmental risks, valuation of public                        goods, vaccinations and withdrawal of life-sustaining medical                   treatment.",
