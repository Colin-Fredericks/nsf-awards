 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in experimental                  physical chemistry between Dr. Sandra Greer, University of                      Maryland, and the following French scientists:   Professor                      Pierre Pfeuty, Laboratoire de Physique des Solides, University                  of Paris-Sud, and Drs. R. Bellissent and F. Boue, Laboratoire                   Leon Brillouin, Grenoble, France.  The objective of the                         proposed research is to carry out structural and dynamical                      studies of living polymers by neutron scattering.                                                                                                               Living polymers are organic polymers which remain in dynamical                  chemical equilibrium with their monomers.  The monomers come                    and go from the active polymers.  The conversion of monomers                    to polymers depends on temperature, commencing only below a                     certain \"ceiling temperature\". Below the ceiling temperature,                   the mole fraction and the average chain length of the                           polymers increase as the temperature is decreased.  The                         investigators propose to study the static and dynamic                           properties of these polymers by neutron scattering.  Dr.                        Greer and her research group have expertise in the preparation                  of samples of living polymers which will remain \"alive\"                         indefinitely.  Dr. Pfeuty is an expert on the statistical                       mechanics of living polymers, while the investigators at the                    Laboratoire Leon Brillouin have extensive experience in                         neutron scattering and polymer research.  In this project,                      samples will be prepared at the University of Maryland and                      transported to the nuclear reactors at Saclay and Grenoble.                     Low angle neutron scattering from living polystyrene in                         deuterated cyclohexane to be carried out at Saclay will                         provide the investigators with information on the structure                     of the polymer chains near the polymerization and near the                      tricritical point, and on the rate of relaxation to the                         equilibrium chain distribution. Studies with the spin echo                      neutron spectrometer at Grenoble will provide information on                    the dynamics of the chain motions.  The proposed experiments                    cannot presently be carried out in the US, because of a lack                    of high-flux small angle neutron scattering facilities.",
