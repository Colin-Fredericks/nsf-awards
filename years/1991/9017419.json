 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subunits of multimeric enzymes have evolved interactive protein                 domains by which assembly and activity are determined.  Ribulose-               1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), with its two                  subunits, LSU and SSU, is an excellent model for studying such                  subunit assembly and interactions.  Extensive biochemical and                   physiological studies are available, including protein/gene                     sequences and crystallographic structures.  Rubisco SSU, which                  does not contribute any active site residues, is essential in the               L8S8 rubisco holoenzyme for activity.  This project will focus                  on the functions of domains in SSU in determining i) folding of                 SSU, ii) assembly of active L8S8, and iii) SSU influence of                     kinetic parameters.  Two of these aspects have been extensively                 studied by us (Wasmann et al., 1989; Ramage, 1990; Smrcka et all,               1990a,b) providing the basis for specific mutations which we will               introduce into SSU by site directed mutagenesis.  After site-                   directed mutagenesis, SSU genes will be expressed in bacteria and               assembled with soluble cyanobacterial L8 in vitro.  Assembly of                 modified SSU will also be investigated following transport into                 chloroplast.  Kinetics of activation, stability of substrate and                effector binding, and binding parameters of substrate analogs                   will be measured with holoenzymes composed of homologous and                    heterologous subunits.  Similar studies on higher plant rubisco                 are prevented as LSU is extremely insoluble in the absence of                   SSU.  Therefore, altered SSU will be expressed and assembled in                 vitro, in isolated chloroplasts, and in vivo, following                         inactivation of resident SSU expression by a ribozyme gene                      construct.  (As an intermediary step to establishing the                        functionality of ribozymes, ribozyme constructs and mutated SSU                 will be tested in vitro, after electroporation of genes into                    mesophyll protoplasts).  The effect of modified SSU on several                  parameters of activity of higher plant rubisco will be                          determined.  The hypothesis is that SSU (cyanobacteria and in                   higher plants) compensates conformational changes induced by the                binding of substrate to the active site.",
