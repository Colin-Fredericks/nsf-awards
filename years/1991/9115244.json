The determination of the mechanistic role and structure of                  various complexes present during electrophilic aromatic                         alkylation, chlorination and acylation-related reactions;                                                                                                       2.  The effects of metal-ion binding on the secondary structure                 of calmodulin and other regulating proteins;                                                                                                                    3.  The photochemical reactivity of furocoumarins (psoralens)                   toward unsaturated compounds, such as thymine residues in DNA;                                                                                                  4.  A mechanistic study of the photochemical reactivity of                      flavins by laser-induced photo-CIDNP technique.                                                                                                                 5.  The synthesis of bimetallic transition-metal complexes                      containing carbon-carbon triple bonds.                                                                                                                          Raman Spectroscopy is concerned with vibrational and rotational                 transitions in molecules.  The information obtained sometimes                   complements that obtained from an infrared study and provides                   valuable structural information.   Fourier-transform Raman                      spectroscopy with near-infrared excitation provides a powerful                  solution to problems of high background fluorescene or sample                   photodegradation or photolability and enhanced signal-to-noise                  quality.  Raman spectroscopy is an invaluable tool in studies                   of condensed-phase chemical and biomolecular systems.",
