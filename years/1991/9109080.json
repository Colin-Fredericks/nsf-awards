 "awd_abstract_narration": "This request is for the purchase of a SQUID magnetometer capable of             providing standard magnetic measurements over a wide range of                   temperature, from 2 to 800 Kelvins.  The SQUID magnetometer is                  needed in fundamental studies of problems in materials science and              engineering, solid state chemistry, and condensed matter physics.               Studies which will make use of the magnetometer include:                        investigations of the critical cross-over energies and redox                    energies in mixed-metal oxides; magnetic interaction in covalent                systems such as chalcogenides and pnictides, crystal chemistry and              properties of metal oxides; permanent magnet alloys, and solid                  freeform fabrication; powder and gas-phase laser processing and                 nanometer powder processing.  An available magnetometer will allow              the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a technique              important for materials synthesis, characterization, and                        processing.  This magnetometer will be housed in the Center for                 Materials Science and Engineering, used primarily by six faculty                members and four other members of the center.  Maintenance and                  operation will be provided by the PI and CO-PI through their                    current and pending NSF support.  The instrument willl be shared by             the PI/CO-PI (70% use) with three other groups (30% use).  About 22             grad students, 7 post-docs, and 4 undergraduate students will have              access to this instrument.",
