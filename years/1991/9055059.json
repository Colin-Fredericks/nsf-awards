The UT Chemical Engineering Summer Workshop is designed to introduce            high school students to the career opportunities available to them in           engineering.  Through a combination of experience:  group discussions,          laboratory experimentation, hands-on computer work, independent group           investigations and field trips, the Workshop participants will receive          an exciting introduction to the field of engineering.  Additionally, the        ethics of engineering and science will also be carefully explored in an         interesting videotaped session and group discussion.                                                                                                            Follow-up activities planned in the academic year include engineering           experiments led by the Workshop participants in their home school               science classes, field trips with the University Student Chemical               Engineering Chapter and invitations to the UT annual engineering college        open house.",
