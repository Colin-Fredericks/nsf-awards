 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, the need for developing techniques and                         methodologies for the design, representation and manipulation of                transactions or behaviors has become clear.  This research                      focuses on the study and development of theoretical foundations                 for object-based database manipulation languages.  Several                      fundamental problems concerning dynamic constraints and update                  transactions in the context of semantic and object-based models                 are investigated.  One aspect is the formal analysis of object                  behaviors under a behavior modeling construct used to compose                   andstructure transactions in projects TAXIS, INSYDE, DAIDA, etc.                The initial study is based on a simple object-oriented data model               including class hierarchies, attributes ranging over printable                  values, and methods.  Another topic is the study of behavior                    modeling primitives as new kinds of dynamic constraint and also                 compare them with other kinds of dynamic constraint.  More                      general database models (e.g., to allow attributes ranging over                 classes) are also considered.  The investigations into these                    problems yield a better understanding of these modeling                         constructs and insights into the impact of Object Identifiers on                database manipulation languages.",
