 "awd_abstract_narration": "A primary function of the nervous system is to help organisms                   adapt to external and internal conditions, by generating the                    appropriate adaptive response.  A major cause for adaptation, in                the nervous system, is due to changes in the biosynthesis of                    neurotransmitters, chemicals responsible for communication                      between nerve cells.  These effects are accomplished through                    alterations in gene activity which are expressed specifically in                neurons controlling the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters.  This                research project will focus on the regulation of the tyrosine                   hydroxylase (TH) gene, the gene responsible for the synthesis of                catecholaminergic neurotransmitters.  The mechanisms through                    which environmental and internal signals induce adaptive changes                in the expression of neural genes are unknown.  Previous studies                conducted by the PI indicate that signals may be conveyed to the                TH gene through the stimulation of two types of receptors, the                  acetylcholine receptor and the hormone, angiotensin II.  The PI                 will determine whether neural and hormonal signals activate and                 regulate later stages of gene expression such as processing and                 maturation of gene products.  Regions of the TH gene that are                   stimulated by neural and hormonal signals will be identified.                   This gene has been linked to many fundamental functions of the                  nervous system including learning, regulation, mood control and                 motivation.  This research offers a model to explore how these                  functions are controlled at the molecular level.",
