 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed planning activities will investigate fundamental                   questions concerning the energetic strategies utilized during                   early development of bathyal crabs.  Specific questions to be                   addressed include: 1). what are the contributions of different                  lipid classes, protein, and carbohydrate toward nutritional                     requirements during embryonic development of the deep-sea red                   crab Chaceon quinquedens; and 2). what are the contributions of                 maternal nutritional history and depth (or temperature) of                      occurrence to the patterns of yolk utilization in red crab                      embryos.  My preliminary work demonstrates that this species                    exhibits two different patterns of yolk composition and                         utilization during embryogenesis.  This proposed planning                       activities are designed to determine the factors responsible                    for the observed variation and will be used as the basis for a                  more detailed comparative study on embryonic nutritional                        flexibility in two species of bathyal crabs, red crab and                       golden crab C. fenneri, which have different geographic and                     bathymetric distributions.",
