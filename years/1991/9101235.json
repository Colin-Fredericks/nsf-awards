 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert Penner will study decorated Teichmuller theory in                   several directions, as follows.  Integrals of monomials of Miller-              Morita-Mumford classes over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces                should be computable using intersection theory on an appropriate V-             manifold compactification of moduli space; in particular, all the               necessary ingredients seem to be in place for applying this scheme              to the computation of Weil-Petersson volumes for once-punctured                 surfaces.  There is also a \"universal\" analog of the decorated                  Teichmuller space, and essentially all of the classical structures              extend to this setting; he hopes the study of this universal space              will shed light on the classical theory.  He furthermore hopes to               compute the complex structure of moduli in his coordinates.                     Computer work will be pursued to derive the combinatorial structure             of the moduli space of once-punctured surfaces of genus three, and              he hopes explicitly to compute the homology of this spaces.                     Finally, a program has evolved for extending some of his work to                the setting of closed surfaces.                                                      Teichmuller theory is a seventy year-old blend of algebraic                geometry, differential geometry, and topology.  As such, advances               will interest a broad spectrum of mathematicians.  Some also have               a bearing on string theory, so some theoretical physicists have a               stake in this research as well.",
