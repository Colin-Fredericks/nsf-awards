 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a two year cooperative                          research project between Professor Kurt Fausch, Department of                   Fishery and Wildlife Biology, Colorado State University, and                    Dr Hiroya Kawanabe, Department of Zoology, Kyoto University,                    Japan.  This project is aimed at increasing our understanding                   of the roles of biotic interactions and environmental                           factors in shaping longitudinal distributions of salmonid                       guilds in mountain streams.  Ecologists have long sought to                     understand the relative roles of biotic and abiotic factors                     in shaping animal communities by investigating distributions                    of species along altitudinal gradients where environmental                      features and species composition change over short distances.                   A frequent finding is that congeneric species, which are                        assumed to compete strongly, occupy different positions along                   the gradient and overlap little.  Furthermore , the distribu-                   tion of one or both species is usually expanded in locations                    where its congener is absent versus those where it is                           present.  The objective of this research is to experimentally                   test whether interspecific interference competition is an                       important mechanism in determining the relative success of                      two congeners, the Japanese charr and the Dolly Varden charr,                   in the altitudinal zone where they are sympatric, in the                        Hidaka Mountains of Hokkaido, Japan.                                                                                                                            Both Professor Fausch and Dr Kawanabe are leading experts in                    their fields and their strengths are complementary.  The                        project will give Professor Fausch the opportunity to                           undertake research in a relatively undisturbed community, and                   the Japanese methods of 3-dimensional mapping of positions                      should yield a more precise examination of interactions and                     displacements than generally encountered.  The results of                       this research should provide a better understanding of the                      ecology of stream salmonids and animal communities in                           general.  Stream salmonids are an economically important                        species and any increase in knowledge of their ecology should                   permit better management of streams that support them.",
