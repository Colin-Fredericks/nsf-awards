 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to support undergraduate students at                  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for an intensive ten-week long                    summer research experience.  The students are housed on grounds                 and each one is assigned to a permanent Laboratory staff member                 to perform an independent research project in the mentor's field                of expertise.  Each student begins his or her project with the                  advisor's close guidance and is subsequently encouraged to work                 independently.  This allows students to develop to their full                   potential and to sample first hand the excitement of experimental               science.  During the program, the students present two series of                seminars:  one in which the students describe their proposed                    research and a final series in which the results of each project                are summarized.  There is also a series of seminars specifically                for the undergraduates in addition to daily lectures given as                   part of the Laboratory series of post-graduate biology courses.                 This undergraduate research program is very oversubscribed and,                 therefore, focuses on selection of individuals who, with proper                 direction, are likely to make a contribution to science in their                ensuing careers.  Strong emphasis is placed on recruiting                       minorities to encourage them to pursue scientific careers.",
