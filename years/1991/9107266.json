Relatively little research has been                                    performed on organizational and public                                          response to earthquake risk information about                                   a specific likely future event, since few                                       actual earthquake predictions, advisories,                                      forecasts (they go by many names) that are                                      scientifically credible have emerged in the                                     United States.  This research is a study of                                     public and organizational response in the                                       complex, urban, multi-county San Francisco                                      Bay Area to the communication of risk                                           information about that area's next major                                        earthquake.  Qualitative and quantitative                                       research will be performed.  Mail                                               questionnaires will collect relevant data on                                    a statistically representative sample of                                        households.  Interviews will be conducted                                       with key informants from purposefully                                           selected local and non-local businesses,                                        government and other health, safety and                                         welfare organizations.  The opportunity to                                      study public and organizational response to                                     scientifically credible risk information                                        about a future major quake in a complex urban                                   setting is rare.
