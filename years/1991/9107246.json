 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many organisms, siblings compete actively for limited                     parental resources, often with fatal results for some brood                     members.  Sometimes this rivalry is accentuated by  overt                       aggression and the establishment of dominance hierarchies.  The                 evolution of self-promoting behavior that sacrifices close kin is               believed to be constrained by two main factors:  (i) the genetic                relatedness between survivor and victim and (ii) the energetic                  costs associated with vigorous competitive begging and/or                       fighting.  In this study, these energetic costs will be measured                in three-chick broods of cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis), an                      abundant colonial bird that practices siblicide, using \"doubly                  labelled water\" (a mixture of stable isotopes).  The behavior of                chicks injected with small amounts of this compound will be                     monitored closely during all waking hours over a two-day period,                after which analysis of a tiny blood sample will reveal the total               energy spent.  This method will be applied to chicks of various                 activity levels, so that the unit costs of each focal activity                  (begging and fighting) can be determined.                                            This exercise will allow testing and modification of                       current intra-family conflict theory, as it directly addresses                  the premise that begging and fighting are expensive.  It will                   also provide information about the efficiency of parental care,                 by showing how much of parentally supplied food energy is used                  for growth, as opposed to self-protection.  On a more practical                 level, this knowledge, and the approach itself, is likely to be                 applicable to various rare and endangered species (e.g., whooping               cranes, various eagles, brown pelicans) whose nestlings compete                 fatally.",
