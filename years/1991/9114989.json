 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global Change research will require scientists trained in                       multidisciplinary approaches to research and technological                      development over the next decade.  It will also require an                      informed and literate public to make wise resource use choices                  through the utilization of the results of the scientific                        research.  Human resources development, therefore, will need to                 be multidisciplinary and include the human dimensions of global                 change.  Many of the federal agencies are addressing these needs                through development of agency specific educational opportunities                but with no long-term framework or strategy for coordination and                cooperation.  The role of the CEES is to provide the coordinating               mechanism for cooperative program planning and development.  As a               result, the University of Rhode Island, in cooperation with the                 CEES Task Group on Glocal Change Education, is proposing a Global               Change Education Program Coordination Workshop for July, 1991.                                                                                                  The first objective of the workshop is to develop a long-term                   framework and strategy for the CEES Education Task Group.  The                  long-term plan will include educational opportunities and                       alternatives for K-14 (precollege and early college), upper level               college and graduate programs, and informal, public education.                  All of the education and training programs of the Task Group are                intended to complement the science priorities of CEES.                                                                                                          The second objective is to provide a cooperative and coordinated                approach for all federal govenment agency global change education               programs.  Such a cooperative approach would help to avoid                      emphases on one area to the detriment of other important foci.                                                                                                  The workshop planned for the W. Alton Jones Campus of the                       University of Rhode Island on July 14-17, 1991 will result in at                least two tangible products:                                                                                                                                         1)   A long-term educational strategy plan including                                 prioritized options; and                                                   2)   Draft implementation strategies.",
