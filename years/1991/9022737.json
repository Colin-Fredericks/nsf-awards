 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Malcolm Potts of Virginia Polytechnic                   Institute and State University for a research visit to work                     with Dr. Siegfried Scherer of the Institute of Plant                            Biochemistry and Physiology of the University of Konstanz,                      Germany.  They are collaborating in an effort to elucidate                      the molecular mechanisms for desiccation tolerance in                           cyanobacteria.  The specific goals of their current work are                    to characterize the recently isolated 'wsp' gene, to understand                 how transcription of 'wsp' is regulated by water stress, and                    to obtain milligram amounts of the water stress protein (Wsp)                   produced by the 'wsp' gene for future structural analysis.                      Dr. Scherer has excellent facilities for the growth of                          cyanobacteria in culture and for protein purification and                       characterization.  He has made substantial contributions to                     the understanding of photosynthesis, respiration and electron                   transport in cyanobacteria.  Dr. Potts has focused more on                      the physiology, biochemistry and genetics of water stress                       tolerance.  Recently, Dr. Potts has developed the necessary                     techniques to understand aspects of the molecular biology of                    Nostoc commune.                                                                                                                                                 Water availability limits the distribution and the activities                   of all living cells.  It is of particular importance to the                     future of managed agriculture.  Despite the considerable                        biochemical restraints imposed by a cell-water deficit,                         certain cells have the capacity to retain both structural and                   functional integrity after exposure to repeated cycles of                       acute water stress.  Cells of the desiccation-tolerant                          photosynthetic procaryote Nostoc commune, a cyanobacterium,                     accumulate massive amounts of a soluble protein when they are                   exposed to repeated cycles of drying and rewetting.  This                       water stress protein (Wsp) has been isolated, purified, and                     partially characterized at the biochemical level.  Recently,                    the gene responsible for encoding this protein has been                         isolated.  This is the subject of the proposed collaborative                    research.",
