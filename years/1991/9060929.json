 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time recognition of speaker-independent                                    connected  speech has proven to be a difficult                                  problem for electronic systems.  Low-precision                                  highly-parallel analog neural networks have been                                shown to recognize speaker-dependent small-                                     vocabulary connected speech using standard                                      components.  This project will research and                                     develop massively-parallel custom integrated                                    circuits that will perform this task, using                                     integrated delay lines and analog computing                                     networks.  Phase I will include the design and                                  fabrication of test chips to prove the feasibility of                           our development.                                                                                                                                                The approach will utilize standard readily                                      available CMOS Bulk integrated circuit                                          technology so products arising from this research                               can be fabricated reliably and economically by a                                number of vendors.  The P.I. has already                                        demonstrated using this technology to fabricate                                 continuous-time analog computing networks and                                   non-linear decision circuits.  He have also shown                               the feasibility of using floating-nodes to provide                              non-volatile storage of analog voltages.  These                                 voltages can be used to control the operation of                                the chip thus implementing the capability to learn                              or be trained in the field.                                                                                                                                     This proposed research addresses the challenging                                and important problem of real-time speech                                       recognition and may lead directly to inexpensive                                products with wide commercial applicability.",
