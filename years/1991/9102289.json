 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program at Iowa State develops a symbiotic relationship with               other similar programs to enlarge the scope of the effort.  The                 students work with students supported by the Department of                      Education Undergraduate Research Opportunities for Minorities as                well as the NSF Minority Scholars program.  These students work on              continuing and new projects in a) Advanced silicon processing for               devices and integrated circuits, b) High-power and high-frequency               bipolar transistors and other microwave devices, c) III-V compound              quantum nanostructures, d) Non-crystalline silicon structures for               energy conversion, e) Basic semiconductor material studies and f)               ASIC design for high-frequency circuits and systems.  They work on              these projects full time during the summer and, if Iowa State                   University students, part time during the academic year. The                    program cooperates with State University of New York - New Paltz,               Lincoln University, and North Carolina A & T.  A microelectronics               fabrication course is offered each summer with teaching                         responsibilities shared by all four participating faculty.  Non-                ISU students are able to transfer the course credits to their home              institutions.  It is expected that a number of the research-trained             and motivated students will continue into graduate studies at ISU               and elsewhere; consequently there is an active recruitment for                  graduate students interested in microelectronics and photonics from             the program participants.",
