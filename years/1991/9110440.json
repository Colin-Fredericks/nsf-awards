The general need for                   high quality research in human-computer interaction (HCI) is                    becoming more and more evident both in industrial and academic                  settings.  This workshop has a primary purpose to establish an                  agenda for research in this critical area.  The workshop brings                 together almost two dozen of the most prominent HCI researches                  from the disciplines of computer science, engineering,                          information science, psychology and human factors along with NSF                staff members.  The results of the workshop is a report                         identifying critical research issues and potential avenues for                  studying them, along with necessary infrastructure                              recommendations related to educational, professional and facility               problems.  The report will be published in major distribution                   publications.",
