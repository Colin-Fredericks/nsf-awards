 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conference on Separations Technology will be                  held in Hawaii, U.S., October 20-25, 1991.  The conference,                     sponsored by the Engineering Foundation, will bring together                    scientists and engineers drawn about 50% from the United                        States and 50% from the Pacific Rim countries, Europe and the                   rest of the world.  The format of the conferences is eight                      half-day oral sessions, covering five days, along with the                      poster sessions.  About 32 invited papers will be presented                     orally, along with at least as many posters.                                                                                                                    The objectives of this conference are threefold:  1) to                         disseminate the latest research results; 2) to define the                       direction of future separations research; and 3) to promote                     U.S. and other countries dialogues and collaboration in                         various important separation research areas.  The conference                    is of considerable importance to the U.S. for a least two                       reasons.  First, separations are crucial to a number of the                     most pressing needs and opportunities for the U.S., including                   development of alternative sources of energy and chemicals;                     protecting and improving the environment; commercial                            development of biotechnology; reduced dependence upon foreign                   sources of critical minerals and metals; and achieving the                      high degrees of purification needed for electronic materials,                   food, and pharmaceuticals.  Secondly, there is much forefront                   research in Japan, Australia and in Europe on separations, and                  the conference affords, and the conference affords U.S.                         scientists and engineers the opportunity to learn about and                     utilize these developments.",
