 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a core-task element of the JGOFS Equatorial Pacific                          Experiment Programs (EquiPac), Woods Hole Oceanographic                         Institution (WHOI) and Oregon State University (OSU) will                       combine efforts to deploy a matrix of sediment traps to                         understand the variability of particle fluxes in time and space                 in the interior of the Equatorial Pacific along 140o/135o W and                 provide critical samples to all EquiPac laboratories.  The                      P.I.'s propose to form a precisely synchronized matrix from 9o                  N to 12o S through the equator at 7 EquiPac Stations at three                   trap depths:  1,200 m, 2,200 m in depth, and 700 m above the                    floor; an 800 m trap will be added to the array at the equator,                 totaling 22 traps, 0.5 m2 opening each, at five JGOFS stations,                 from the equator to 12o S with a span of 12 degrees, 1,333 km.                  A unit sampling period will be two weeks (14 days), the same as                 the JGOFS N.A. Bloom Experiment.  Samples are pre-poisoned with                 buffered formaldehyde preservative and, except for during the                   collection phase, are positively sealed from ambient sea water                  throughout the period of deployment.  WHOI will be in charge of                 4 arrays with 13 traps to be deployed south of the equator at                   0o, 2o S, 5o S and 12o S, and OSU will take care of the                         remaining northern arrays.                                                      WHOI and OSU laboratories will collaborate to provide JGOFS with                data on the following essential components at the earliest                      opportunity:  total (dry), carbonate, combustible, biogenic                     silicate, and lithogenic fluxes, carbon, nitrogen contents in                   combustible organic matter, and organic/inorganic phosphorus in                 solid and dissolved phase in the sampler cup using three 1/10                   aliquots.  WHOI and OSU will complete intercalibration of the                   analytical procedure and produce coherent data under close                      laboratory collaboration.  A 1/10 aliquot will be archived at                   each of the laboratories.  The rest, 6/10 of the flux sample, an                average of approximately 300 mg per unit sample allowing a large                margin of differences according to station and season, will be                  distributed among the relevant JGOFS programs.                                     //",
