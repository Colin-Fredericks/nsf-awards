 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heat recovery in utility boilers is maximized when a                            particular temperature distribution within the furnace and its                  downstream heat recovery apparatus is maintained.  This design                  temperature distribution provides the optimum balance between                   steam production by radiant heat transfer in the furnace                        section and steam reheating or superheating in the convective                   heat transfer section.  When the temperature distribution                       deviates from its design condition, turbine efficiency                          declines either because:  a) the steam production is too low                    due to insufficient heat absorption in the furnace; or, b) not                  enough sensible heat remains in the exhaust to superheat the                    steam (since too much heat is absorbed in the furnace).  Off-                   design operation can also lead to tube overheating failures,                    ash deposition, and cold-end corrosion.                                                                                                                         This SBIR project continues the development and testing of a                    non-intrusive rapid-response instrument able to monitor ash                     particle temperatures in furnace exhaust gases.  Because the                    particles are thermally equilibrated with the gas, the                          measurement is, in fact, an accurate representation of the                      local gas temperature.  The instrument employs an innovative                    variation of two-color pyrometry to eliminate errors,                           associated with radiation from the primary combustion zone and                  boiler walls, which have confounded previous attempts to                        accurately measure exhaust gas temperatures.  The prototype                     instrument will be coupled to a furnace control system and,                     after verification of proper operation, used to control and                     optimize one aspect of the combustion process.  This will lead                  to increased plant efficiency.  The instrument can also be                      used to control incinerator furnace temperatures, specifically                  to maintain them above 1700oF in order to minimize emission of                  toxic organics such as aromatic hydrocarbon or chlorinated                      dioxin/furans.  Indirect benefits of the device include                         increased plant longevity, reduced pollutant emissions, and                     the extended lifetime of our finite fossil fuel resources.  As                  part of this program, an instrument for calibrating furnace                     exhaust gas spectral signatures is also being built.  This                      instrument will be useful for acquiring data needed to                          commercialize the temperature monitor.",
