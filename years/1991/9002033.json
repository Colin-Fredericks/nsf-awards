 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop new computational methods and software               for determining the conformation states and kinematic behavior of               mobile molecules by means of geometric reasoning.  The resultant                computer programs are expected to be of value to researchers in                 many areas of structural chemistry and biochemistry, including                  spectroscopists who wish to interpret their data in terms of a                  precise molecular model, stereochemists who need to find all the                conformers consistent with a given bonding arrangement, and                     molecular biologists attempting to predict protein and nucleic acid             conformation.  Because a wide variety of information concerning the             structure of molecules can be encoded in terms of constraints on                their interatomic distances, our first goal is to improve our                   understanding of and ability to reason directly with these                      constraints.  The next goal is to devise more efficient and                     reliable methods of finding atomic coordinates compatible with the              constraints, and determining what motions are consistent with them.             The final goal is to develop a user-friendly, window-oriented                   interface that enables one to visually prepare the input, perform               the computations, and analyze their results graphically.",
