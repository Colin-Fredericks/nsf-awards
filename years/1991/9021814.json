 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Alabama for the renovation and repair of Lloyd Hall               which houses the synthetic chemistry, biochemistry, and materials               science research and research training activities of the                        Department of Chemistry.  This building was constructed in 1931                 and last renovated in 1980.  The ARFMP grant of $1,060,000 and                  $1,270,321 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to              modernize these research and research training facilities.  This                project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure in terms of health and safety as well as of                      quantity, quality, and efficiency of the research that can be                   conducted by (a) converting the former chemistry library for use                as research laboratory space; (b) installing additional or                      replacement fume hoods, additional electrical circuits, and                     gaseous nitrogen lines; (c) upgrading the building's heating,                   ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system; and (d)                        providing more safety equipment.                                                                                                                                This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of undergraduate and graduate students.                        Penetration into new research areas made possible by this                       renovation will increase the productivity of the Department of                  Chemistry's graduate students and hence the role that the                       University of Alabama will be able to play in helping to meet the               nation's current and future scientific manpower needs.",
