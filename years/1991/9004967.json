 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Dolichos biflorus plant contains a family of lectin genes, some             of which are differentially expressed, both spatially and                       temporally.  This laboratory has shown that the genes for two of                these lectins, the seed lectin and DB58, are highly homologous and              have limited differences in their flanking regions.  In the                     proposed continuation of this work, the tissue specific regulation              and developmental expression of these two genes will be examined.               Initial studies will focus on transgenic analyses of cis elements               of these genes.  Transgenic studies coupled with site directed                  mutagenesis will also be employed in an effort to identify the                  signals by which these two lectins are targeted to their different              subcellular destinations.                                                                                                                                       Basic information gained in this research should contribute to the              eventual elucidation of the physiological role of plant lectins and             to our understanding of the regulation of expression and                        intracellular targeting of lectins and other plant proteins.",
