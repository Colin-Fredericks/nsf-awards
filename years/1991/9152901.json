The purpose of this purchase is to                   help reinstitute courses successfully taught during the 1970's                  which offered undergraduates the opportunity to collect                         original observations on familiar bird species.  These courses                  taught the fundamental precepts of science as organized                         curiosity of focussing on the student's own perception of the                   birds and on research problems of the students' own devising.                   Students came to understand scientific methods not as arbitrary                 constraints as a way of accomplishing goals of their own                        devising.  Since bird song is the most salient feature of bird                  behavior, these courses will be made much more effective if                     students have access to a simple, convenient device for the                     display and analysis of bird song.  Such a device will enable                   many students, particularly the more inventive and persistent,                  to develop and test hypotheses concerning the relationship of                   bird song to other behaviors that they are observing.",
