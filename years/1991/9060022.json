 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fatty acid (FA) composition of oilseed crops is an economically             important trait amenable to modification by genetic engineering.                For example, it should be possible to engineer a canola (rapeseed)              oil with a lower content of linolenic acid, an undesirable                      component that causes rancidity.  Transposon tagging provides a                 powerful genetic approach to isolate genes encoding enzymes that                are difficult to purify, such as those involved in FA biosynthesis.             The small model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a close relative of               rapeseed.  We propose to isolate the fad3 gene, responsible for the             formation of linolenic acid in Arabidopsis, as a first step towards             the modification of the FA composition in canola.  We will use our              engineered streptomycin resistance assay (SPT) to visually detect               transposition of the maize transposon Activator (Ac) in                         Arabidopsis.  Somatic excision of Ac from an SPT::Ac gene produces              green spots on the white cotyledons of seedlings germinated on                  streptomycin and germinal transposition results in green revertant              seedlings in the same assay.  Therefore, the SPT::Ac system allows              us to select plants that have undergone transposition.  By                      selecting green revertants from plants that carry Ac closely linked             to fad3, and selfing them, we should be able to identify tagged                 fad3 mutations and clone them by homology to Ac.  The analogous                 gene can be cloned from canola by homology to the Arabidopsis gene              and subsequently modified and reintroduced to the oilseed crop.",
