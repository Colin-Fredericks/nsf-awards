 "awd_abstract_narration": "The flowering plants comprise the largest group of plants,                 Angiospermae with approximately 500,000 species.  In addition to                sheer diversity, the angiosperms are of tremendous economic                     importance to humans.  Angiosperms are also major elements of many              or most terrestrial ecosystems, and dominate all non-coniferous                 terrestrial biomes.  Understandably, botanists have been interested             in developing models and inferences concerning the origin and                   radiation of this highly significant group.  Within the past two                decades techniques (molecular systematics and cladistics) have                  become available to permit rigorous scientific inquiry into the                 problem of the origin of the flowering plants and phylogenetic                  models of the group.  Accordingly hypotheses of phylogenetic                    relationships are now available for the base of the angiosperm                  tree.                                                                                The origin and primary radiation of the angiosperms was in the             Cretaceous; however, the fossil records from the Cretaceous are                 relatively poor.  Crane proposes to examine the diversity of fossil             angiosperms in Cretaceous deposits in what is now the eastern                   United States and Portugal.  These samples include flowers, pollen,             fruits, and seed, all of which are of diagnostic utility in                     understanding and classifying flowering plants.  He intends to                  explore relationships among the fossil forms by integrating them                into the current models of relationships and to test those models.              Based on these findings, he proposes to explore the paleoecology                and and pollination of the earliest angiosperms.  New models of                 relationships will be developed as appropriate.  Examination of the             specimens, which are already in collections, will be via electron               and light microscopy.                                                                The described research will have a salutary effect on our                  understanding of the angiosperms and their evolutionary history.                This, in turn, should stimulate additional research using molecular             and cladistic approaches.",
