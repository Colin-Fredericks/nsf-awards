 "awd_abstract_narration": "Onagraceae is one of the most thoroughly studied families                  among the flowering plants.  The family has the potential to serve              as a model for the study of adaptive radiation.  However, a                     rigorous, detailed phylogeny is required to provide a foundation                for additional work on radiation within the family.  Traditional                characters have failed to resolve adequately the evolutionary                   pattern wtihin Onagraceae.  The PI proposes to use cpDNA                        restriction site variation and sequence analyses of nuclear rDNA                to explore phylogeny within the tribe Epilobeae and to sequence                 rbcL from cpDNA to examine intertribal phylogenetic relationships               within the family as a whole.  He will also use these and other                 methods to fix Onagraceae within the larger order Myrtales.                     Finally, the inferred phylogeny will be used to assess character                evolution within the family.  The proposed research should permit               the reexamination of the systematics of the family as well as                   morphological and physiological evolution that will permit                      additional levels of syntheses concerning adaptation and evolution.",
