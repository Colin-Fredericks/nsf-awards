 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project are to examine the role of                   biotic interactions in a Chilean small mammal assemblage.                       Predation, plant-small mammal interactions, and interspecific                   competition are being studied with experimental exclusions of                   predators, and the most abundant small mammal herbivore, the degu               rat, from fenced exclosures.  Small mammal populations will be                  censused monthly, and predator diets and activity monitored by                  scat/pellet collections and analysis, and olfactory lines and                   call playbacks.  Plant community changes are followed with point                intercept sampling each 4 months, and monthly sampling during the               annual growing season; soil samples every 4 months track seed                   densities.  Similar initial conditions were present, and few                    changes in plant species cover, composition or seed densities                   have occurred since experiment initiation in May 1989.  Numbers                 of degus in predator exclusion plots were higher during spring                  (September-November 1989): survival times and rates were                        significantly higher throughout the year.  Responses of other                   small mammal species to predator/degu exclusions have been mixed.               Continued support is requested for three years since changes in                 the small mammal assemblage and plant community are likely to be                long-term.  This large scale project represents the first long-                 term study of biotic interactions in a temperate Neotropical                    vertebrate assemblage.",
