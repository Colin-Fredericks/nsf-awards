 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is intended to carry out several theoretical and                        observational studies related to nonlinear MHD waves and Langmuir               waves in the region of space upstream to the Earth's bowshock.                  It is planned to compare the large amplitude MHD waves, and in                  particular their steepened appearance, to the solutions of                      nonlinear wave equations such as the Derivative Nonlinear                       Schrondinger Equation (DNLS).  Efforts will be made to append                   terms to the DNLS which describe important physical effects such                as resonant particle interactions, realistic particle                           distribution functions, oblique propagation, and two and three                  dimensionality.  An extensive investigation, currently in                       progress, of the various linear and nonlinear wave processes                    which are important in the upstream MHD waves will be completed.                Twenty periods of upstream wave activity have been identified,                  the data acquired, and power spectra and cross correlation                      functions calculated.  New work will address the extent to which                pondermotive nonlinearities, the parametric decay instability,                  and three dimensional wave effects can be discerned in the data.                In the study of Langmuir waves, work will concentrate on further                numerical and analytic studies of the saturated phase of the beam               instability using computer simulations in part.  The goal of                    these studies will be to better understand such phenomena as wave               backscattering, generation of low frequency waves, and the long                 time evolution of the beam-driven waves.",
