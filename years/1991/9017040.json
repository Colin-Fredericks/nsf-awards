The                     trilateral conference is intended to accelerate the                             exchange of information on computer based and statistical                       approaches to the engineering design of quality products                        and processes.  The conference is expected to last 5 days,                      and will consist of mainly invited papers and few                               contributed papers, and will allow for extensive formal and                     informal discussions.  Seven major sessions are planned:                        materials formulation and processsing design; metrology in                      materials development; electro-mechanical design; metrology                     in electro-mechanical design; statistical quality                               engineering techniques for design; total quality control;                       and computer-aided design system requirements.  The Indian                      organizer is Dr. B. K. Pal of the Indian Statistical                            Institute in Bangalore, India.  The conference proceedings                      are expected to be published.                                                                                                                                   Scope: Several organizations in the three countries are                         expected to support the conference including the Indian                         Institute of Technology, Madras, Indian Institute of                            Science, Bangalore, Baharat Heavy Electric Co., Bangalore,                      The National Aeronautical Laboratory and the Bureau of                          Indian Standards in India, the National Institute for                           Standard and Technology (NIST) in the U.S., and the Union                       of Japanese Scientists and Engineers in Japan.  The topic                       of the conference is quite important to the U.S. and to                         India.  The publication of the proceedings will be helpful                      to workers in this field in the U.S. academic and                               industrial organizations, and could lead to collaboration                       with Indian scientists.  The project fits well with the                         objectives of the U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program.",
