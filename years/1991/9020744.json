 "awd_abstract_narration": "Resonant-mass detectors of gravitational radiation have                    been developed that can be reliably operated at liquid helium                   temperature (4.2K) with sensitivities h ~ 10-18.  At this                       sensitivity level we do not expect to detect gravitational                      wave signals from anything but the rarest astrophysical                         events.  However, the technology to build an ultralow                           temperature (40mK) detector with sensitivity of at least h ~                    10-19 and likely 10-20, sufficient to detect gravitational                      radiation from plausible astrophysical events that could occur                  in our galaxy or its immediate vicinity, is in hand.  The                       Stanford research program has the following key elements:                            a) completion of an ultralow temperature (40 mK) detector                  now under construction,                                                              b) operation of this detector in coincidence with other                    gravitational wave and neutrino burst detectors,                                     c) operation of the existing 4 K detector until reliable                   operation of ultralow temperature detector is achieved,                              d) continuing research to advance the state-of-the-art in                  superconductive modulated-inductance transducers,                                    e) upgrade of the existing 4K detector,                                         f) research on advanced detector development including                     low-frequency vibration isolation and investigation of                          alternative antenna material.                                                        This group has pioneered the construction of cryogenic                     gravity wave receivers, and operates one of the three most                      sensitive detectors in the world.  Further improvement of                       their receiver will not only provide leadership in the search                   for gravitational waves, it will provide important                              technological spin-off in precision measurements and vibration                  isolation which will be of use to a wider community.",
