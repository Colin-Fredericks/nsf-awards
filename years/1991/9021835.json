 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to The                 Pennsylvania State University-University Park Campus for the                    renovation and repair of Fenske Laboratory which houses that                    institution's chemical engineering research and research training               activities, including tribology research, materials science of                  surfactants, environmental processes, and catalysis. This building              was constructed in 1958 and was expanded by the addition of a new               wing in 1968, but it has not been renovated since that time.  The               ARFMP grant of $825,000 and $1,133,226 provided by the grantee as               cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve             the current research infrastructure by upgrading heating and air-               conditioning to ensure proper conditions for computers and                      sensitive instruments; installing proper ventilation, lighting, and             electrical circuits to meet health and safety standards; providing              handicapped access; installing the wiring necessary for a computer              network; and refurbishing  laboratory space.                                                                                                                    This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for one of the                 nation's premier research programs, the Tribology Research                      Program, as well as for other fields of The Pennsylvania State                  University's Department of Chemical Engineering.  Students trained              in these laboratories, where high technology instruments are used               and where numerous functional fluids and lubricants have been                   developed, are in demand in both basic and applied research                     fields.",
