 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonmarine molluscs are abundant animal macrofossils of                     uppermost Cretaceous and Paleocene continental strata in western                North America.  Their biochronologic potential, however, has yet                to be realized due primarily to the lack of study focused on                    biostratigraphic ranges of taxa in thick sequences of strata                    temporally controlled by correlation with fossil mammals.  The                  proposed study will construct a biostratigraphic and biochronologic             zonation of Lancian (uppermost Cretaceous), Puercan, Torrejonian,               and Tiffanian (lower, middle, upper Paleocene, respectively) strata             in the northern Great Plains.  The project will consist of the                  following parts:  1) Field work to stratigraphically organize known             Lancian age localities in the Hell Creek Formation of the Williston             Basin (Montana/North Dakota) and the Lance Formation in the Powder              River Basin (Montana/Wyoming), 2) field work to discover Puercan                and Torrejonian age mollusk localities in the lower portion of the              Fort Union Group, which remain relatively uncommon, 3) general                  taxonomic study of the uppermost Cretaceous and Paleocene mollusks              to provide a framework for taxon identification, and 4) detailed                taxonomic study of selected taxa within families that appear to be              particularly useful for purposes of biostratigraphy and                         biochronology in the northern Great Plains.//",
