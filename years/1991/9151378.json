 "awd_abstract_narration": "An electronic device laboratory to teach physics and practical                  operation of semiconductor electronic devices is being                          developed as part of a electronic device course.  This                          undergraduate teaching laboratory demonstrates some of the                      \"difficult to grasp\", but \"easy to see\" notions in                              semiconductor device physics.  Starting with experiments to                     illustrate the concepts of energy band gap and positively                       charged quasi-particles in semiconductors, students progress to                 examine optical processes and electrical conduction in a                        variety of important electronic devices.  These experiments                     each are performed in thirty minutes and incorporate state of                   the art virtual instrumentation techniques to reduce the time                   needed for data acquisition so that the students will have                      enough time to carefully perform the experiment and understand                  the fundamentals behind the phenomena that they are examining;                  a balance is maintained, however, between the ease of use and                   pedagogical considerations.",
