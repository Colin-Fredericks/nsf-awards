This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with                  the R/V LAURENTIAN, a research vessel owned and operated by the                 University.  A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule                during 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.                   The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the                  ship and of the University to support research and engineering                  activities.  The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                      -Side-scan sonar system for mapping details of bottom                            morphology that are useful in studies of sedimentation and                      the distribution of various objects and structures, and                        -Niskin bottles for collecting discrete seawater samples at                      various depths in the water column,                                                                                                                            The instrumentation described above will increase the capability                of the University to support NSF-sponsored research and                         engineering projects.",
