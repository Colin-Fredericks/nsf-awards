 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Washington project will develop recruiting,                   retention and funding programs to substantially increase the number             of underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities             entering graduate study leading to doctoral degrees in engineering.             A special emphasis on disabled students, with strong support from               the University of Washington Disabled Students Office, will improve             our ability to recruit and attract persons with disabilities.  This             project will significantly expand the amount of financial                       assistance available to the targeted groups, while intensifying the             recruiting and retention efforts required to attract, retain and                graduate more PhD students.  An extensive research program will                 serve as one of the key elements of the recruiting and retention                strategies.  The multi-disciplinary efforts will serve as a magnet              in the attraction of outstanding graduate students to our                       nationally recognized research centers and programs.  NSF funding               will provide initial student support, while the College of                      Engineering develops sustaining fellowship and scholarship support              to perpetuate the program on a long-term basis.  Another key                    element of our recruiting and retention strategy is the five-year               grant period, rather than the total of eight PhD students that                  could be funded by NSF funds alone.  This will be accomplished by:              the use of tuition waivers; and aggressive and quick transfer of                candidates from NSF support to institutional support during the                 grant period.",
