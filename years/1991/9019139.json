 "awd_abstract_narration": "When DNA molecules of appropriate structures are injected into the              nuclei of Xenopus laevis oocytes, they are recombined very                      efficiently.  This process is completely dependent on sequence                  homology between the recombining DNAs and on those DNAs being                   linear.  Characterization of this process will be continued with                the goals of achieving a complete description of its molecular                  mechanism and of the activities that catalyze each step in the                  pathway.  The proposed approach has several facets:  construction               of substrates that test predictions of possible recombination                   mechanisms; isolation and characterization of recombination                     intermediates; and injection of putative intermediates to prove                 that they are on the pathway to recombination products.                         Considerable effort will be directed at improving and exploiting                a recently developed cell-free oocyte nuclear extract that                      catalyzes complete recombination events.  Requirements for                      recombination in the extract will be examined as a means of                     determining the underlying biochemical processes.  Components of                the extract will be fractionated in an effort to purify enzymes                 that catalyze individual steps in recombination.",
