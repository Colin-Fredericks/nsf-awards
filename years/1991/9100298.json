 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                           Organometallic Chemistry Prorgam in support of the research of                  Dr. Myron Rosenblum of Brandeis University. The objective of                    the research is the design, synthesis and property                              characterization of a new class of sterically constrained                       metallocenes held in a face-to-face orientation. Such materials                 are expected to have interesting electrical conductivity and                    possibly nonlinear optical properties.                                                                                                                          Triad molecules consisting of three such metallocene units                      either all identical (homonuclear) or different(heteronuclear)                  will be prepared.  The synthesis of homonuclear polymers                        composed of chains of such face-to-face metallocenes will also                  be carried out as well as those in which two different metals                   alternate in the polymer chain. Synthesis of branched-chain                     polymers in which cyclopentadienylmetal clusters containing                     two, three or four cyclopentadienylmetal centers form repeating                 units within the polymer are planned.  Analogous metallocene                    systems derived from 2,2'-bis(metallocenyl)-1,1-binaphthyls                     will be made and studied.  These substances are capable of                      exhibiting electronic interactions either through the                           face-to-face conformation or through the binaphthyl rings, and                  are, in principle, preparable in optically active form.                         Collaborations are in place to characterize the electrical and                  magnetic properties of the polymers.",
