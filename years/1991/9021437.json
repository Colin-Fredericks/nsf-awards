 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Santa Fe Institute (SFI), a non-profit research and                    graduate teaching organization, proposes to continue its programs               of interdisciplinary research and education on the principles                   that determine the dynamic behavior of complex systems.  The                    Institute is founded on the premise that there are common                       principles that determine the behavior of various complex                       systems, especially systems that are sufficiently complex to                    learn and adapt.  Our approach is to understand these principles                by studying specific systems in the context of more general                     themes.  Since 1987 it has operated a center in Santa Fe where                  leading scholars in the physical, computational, life, and social               sciences come together.                                                              The project includes:  a) A program on the basic physics,                  mathematics, information sciences, and computational aspects of                 complexity including work on the shared properties of complex                   systems, and innovative computer modeling.  b) A residential                    research program on adaptive computation employing the techniques               of general algorithms and classifier systems and including work                 on developing computational and visualization tools.  c)  A                     residential research program on economics as a complex, adaptive                system.  d)  A program on life sciences, that includes modeling                 of the immune system, generic data analysis, and models of                      protein folding.  e) A Summer School on the Sciences of                         Complexity in Santa Fe, managed by SFI in collaboration with a                  number of other institutions.",
