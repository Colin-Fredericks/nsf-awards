 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this project is to understand the molecular               events underlying tissue growth and development. Working with                   Drosophila melanogaster, Dr. Blackman is studying the expression                of the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene in the group of cells, called                 imaginal disks, that give rise to much of the adult's epidermis.                The dpp gene is a member of the TGF-beta family of secreted                     growth factors and is required for normal pattern formation in                  the developing disks. Its expression during disk growth is                      controlled by a 30 kb cis-regulatory region lying downstream (3')               of the transcription unit. Distributed throughout this region are               numerous regulatory elements, suggesting that many genes interact               with dpp to control its pattern of expression. During the project               period, Dr. Blackman proposes to: 1) continue his molecular                     analysis of the cis-regulatory sequences controlling dpp                        transcription in the imaginal disks and 2) identify genetically                 those genes responsible for the trans-acting regulatory factors                 which interact with these sequences. The products of the TGF-beta               family are involved in a broad range of growth regulatory events                in mammals, amphibians, and insects. While the vertebrate systems               have provided a wealth of information on the cell biology and                   biochemistry of the factors, Drosophila affords the ideal system                for examining the role of these molecules during development.",
