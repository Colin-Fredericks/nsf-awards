 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project combines work on graph embeddings and parallel             algorithms to study a variety of emulation problems for processor               arrays, i.e., parallel architectures that consist of a communication            network having processing elements at each mode.  The research focuses          on a variey of theoretical problems that relate to the design,                  programming, and implementation of \"real\" processor arrays.  More               specifically, the research problems motivating the research include             attempts to:                                                                                                                                                       o simplify the programming of a parallel architecture, by allowing                the programmer to specify an algorithm for an idealized                         architecture which is then emulated by an actual architecture;                                                                                                o understand the relative communication power of various                          interconnection networks, by determining how efficiently                        arrays based on each of the networks can emulate arrays                         based on the others, on general computations;                                                                                                                 o achieve fault tolerance, by having an array that has been                       crippled by defects emulate a fault-free version of itself.                                                                                                The theoretical results obtained in the course of the proposed                  research should lend insights into the \"real\" analogs of the problems           studied.",
