 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecosystem development and the maintenance of diversity appears to               be a function of the strength of linkages among plants and                      decomposers and the influence that the linkages have on nutrient                availability.  The lodgepole pine forest and adjacent mountain                  meadows near Fox Park, WY, are ecosystems that differ in                        structure and function, yet share a common climate, similar                     topography, and have developed on soils derived from the same                   parent materials.  Recent work at the sites suggests that the                   linkages among plants and decomposers are specialized to the                    substrates, soils and microclimate of their own ecosystem.                                                                                                      Two manipulative field studies and a series of laboratory studies               will be conducted to determine how specific the plant-decomposer                linkages are, and the mechanisms that shape and preserve them.                  The \"Canopy Manipulation Study\" will determine the influences                   that canopy structure, litter quality, and soil properties have                 on decomposer food web structure and nitrogen dynamics of the                   lodgepole pine forest and adjacent meadow.  The \"Decomposer                     Deletion Study\" will test whether competitive exclusion among                   decomposers or habitat alteration are the mechanisms that                       maintain the integrity of each system.  The Laboratory studies                  will investigate the range of substrates that decomposers from                  the meadow and forest utilize, and the soil and climatic                        conditions under which the dominant isolates from each system                   optimally grow and reproduce.",
