 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Jacob Leventhal of the                        University of Missouri at St. Louis in a research collaboration                 with Professors M. Allegrini and E. Arimondo of the University                  of Pisa, Italy.  The purpose of the collaboration is to study                   the interaction of highly excited atoms in order to better                      understand atomic properties at the boundary between classical                  and quantum mechanics.                                                                                                                                          The work, which represents a continuation of collaborative                      work starting in the early 80's, is producing significant                       research in atomic interactions.  The proposed experiments                      will combine the infrared expertise of the Italian group with                   techniques developed in St. Louis for the production of                         highly excited atoms.  Fundamental to the experimental set-up                   is the fact that highly excited atoms, by virtue of their                       sensitivity and exaggerated responses, provide useful                           amplification of atomic properties making it feasible to                        study effects that would otherwise be difficult to observe.",
