 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish a Research Training Group in the                      Analysis of Biological Diversification.  The faculty group                      includes members of the Departments of Molecular and Cellular                   Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Geology.  The                    funds awarded will provide stipends for undergraduate, graduate                 and post-doctoral trainees, and will defray part of the cost of                 trainee's research.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase                specialized research equipment to be used by trainees and to                    bring investigators from other research and academic institutions               to the campus for seminars.  University resources will augment                  the funds provided by NSF in most of these categories.                                                                                                          Molecular, developmental, and population biologists, as well as                 systematists, ecologists and paleontologists, have developed                    distinctive approaches to the study of biological diversity.                    Owing to the way in which students have been trained                            traditionally, the connections among these approaches have not                  been explored in detail.  While their individual research                       interests are as diverse as the list above, the faculty have                    formed this group with the aim of using phylogeny, which can be                 viewed as the history of diversification, as an approach to the                 integration of these disparate perspectives.",
