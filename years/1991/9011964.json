 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Puerto Rico will establish a Research Careers                 Program for Minority Scholars to provide opportunities for                      undergraduate research training in the fields of physical science,              mathematics, and engineering in which Hispanics are notably                     underrepresented.  The program will have a significant impact in                increasing the number of minority students who choose to pursue                 graduate studies and careers in these fields.  The UPR-RCMS Program             will create an academically enriched environment by providing:                  intensive research experiences for students with researchers from               EPSCoR and MRCE Programs, who will work closely with them as mentors            and role models; special seminars and colloquia to expose trainees to           invited minority minority scientists with whom they will discuss their          research projects; participation in local and national scientific               research meetings in which they will be encouraged to make                      presentations; a language skills tutorial for improving the oral and            written presentation of their research; and an orientation program to           assist them in identifying and entering graduate programs, obtaining            financial support for graduate studies, and selecting careers in                science, mathematics, and engineering.  Twenty-four talented students           will participate each year during a five-year period.  As part of               their research training, the eight most outstanding students will               travel to national research laboratories for further training each              year.  Students will be required, as a result of their participation            in the RCMS Program, to prepare a thesis or co-author a publication in          a scientific journal.  Participants will be tracked through graduate            studies to determine the success of the program in preparing competent          minority scientists.",
