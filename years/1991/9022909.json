 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                             Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Balch will                    continue the synthesis of ligands, generally containing some                    phosphine binding sites, that form complexes containing                         clusters of metal ions.  These clusters show promise as sensors                 for a number of toxic pollutants and as catalysts for some                      reactions of commercial importance.                                                                                                                             The following goals will be pursued. (1) The design and                         synthesis of new polyfunctional ligands for constructing                        transition metal complexes.  (2) To develop the coordination                    chemistry of these new ligands so that metal cluster forming                    reactions can be carried out with some degree of predictability                 and control.  (3) The design and synthesis of new metallo-                      macrocycles which contain metal ions as an intrinsic part of                    their cyclic structure, and the exploration of the ability of                   these to bind inorganic and organic substances.  (4) To examine                 the metal-metal bonding in these clusters and their electronic                  spectra and luminescence.  (5) To explore their use as                          catalysts and in organic synthesis.  (6) To initiate                            photochemical experiments including studies of the reactivity                   of excited states of these clusters.  (7)  To explore the                       ability of monophosphines to function as bridging ligands.",
