 "awd_abstract_narration": "At this time, as a result of political and economic changes,                    scientists and engineers in Eastern Europe confront new issues of               scientific freedom and responsibility.  The initiation of East-                 West exchanges to explore these issues promises intellectual and                practical benefits to all parties.  This project is designed as a               planning effort; it will initiate such exchange and lead to                     further exchanges in workshops involving scientists, engineers,                 and other specialists from the U.S. and Eastern Europe.  In this                planning effort, a U.S. delegation composed of project staff and                three Advisory Committee members will travel to Eastern Europe to               meet with counterparts, four of whom have been chosen to be                     members of the Advisory Committee.  The trip will be preceded by                a careful process of preparation to develop a framework and                     agenda for discussion.  This process will generate a background                 paper with review comments by four academic specialists to be                   circulated for feedback from the Advisory Committee members prior               to the trip.  The aim is to ensure not only that cooperative ties               are formed by that knowledge useful for further research and for                policy is generated.  The institutional resources of the American               Association for the Advancement of Science have already been used               to identify and secure the commitment of appropriate key people                 in Eastern Europe.  These are very good institutional resources                 for carrying out this project effectively.  The outcome is to be                a detailed plan for workshops to follow.  From this planning                    effort and the workshops, reports will be produced to reach                     appropriate audiences in the research and policy communities.                                                                                                   The proposal is a modest request for support to enable a well                   selected group to oprepare for an undertake travel to initiate                  East-West exchanges with counterparts in Eastern Europe on issues               of scientific freedom and responsibility.  The principal                        investigators and project associates are well qualified.  The                   Eastern European representatives have been carefully chosen.  The               institutional support is very good.  The project plans are good                 and have been developed with requisites for academic research                   in mind.  Support is highly recommended.",
