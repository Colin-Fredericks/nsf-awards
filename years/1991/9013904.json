 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                 the Chemistry Division, Professor Sibert will carry out a set                   of fully quantum mechanical calculations of rotation-vibration                  states of polyatomic molecules. A knowledge of these states is                  necessary to predict the rates of chemical reactions.                                                                                                           The calculations will encompass a wide range of molecules using                 both variational and perturbative techniques. The goal of the                   calculations is to elucidate the connections between                            Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces and the dynamics and                 spectroscopy, which occurs as a result of motion on these                       surfaces. The systems to be treated will include H2O, SO2, HCN,                 HCCH, NH3, and H2CO. Coordinate and basis set representations                   will be developed which facilitate not only the calculation of                  spectra given a potential energy surface, but also the inverse,                 namely, the calculation of potential energy surfaces given the                  spectra. The representation chosen to describe the                              rotating-vibrating molecules will be specifically designed to                   describe certain large amplitude motions for which Jacobi                       coordinates are inadequate. An understanding of these                           transformations  plays a pivotal role in our ability to                         understand and develop theories of reaction rates, reaction                     dynamics, collisional energy transfer, and mode specific                        effects.",
