 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principle Investigator will determine the importance of             the timing of water stress on changing the susceptibility of                    ponderosa pine \u001aPinus\u001a \u001aponderosa\u001a to an outbreak prone insect                  herbivore, \u001aNeodiprion\u001a \u001agillettei\u001a.  This research will test the               hypothesis that environmental stress predisposes forests to                     insect outbreaks only when stress occurs at a time within the                   seasonal growth of the tree that creates a disequilibrium in the                ecological balance between root and shoot growth.  The specific                 hypothesis to be tested is that stress applied during the shoot                 growth phase will increase the root:shoot ratio and decrease                    susceptibility to insects; while stress applied during the root                 growth phase will decrease the root:shoot ratio and increase                    susceptibility to insects.                                                              The proposed research will test the widely held belief that             stress predisposes forests to insect outbreaks.  This research                  will also examine the fundamental process of seasonal allocation                of carbon between roots and shoots and the response of herbivores               to differences in this allocation pattern.  These processes are                 strongly affected by variations in climate and likely are under                 genetic control.  Better understanding of these processes will                  improve the predictability of the impact of insect herbivores on                ponderosa pine forests under future unknown global climate                      conditions.",
