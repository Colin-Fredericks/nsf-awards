 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) has made                   a conscious decision to be a major producer of minority                         scientists, mathematician, and engineers.  It's successful                      Meyerhoff Scholarship Program, initiated in 1988, is designed                   to facilitate the recruitment of minority scholars into these                   fields.                                                                           NSF support is requested to expand and enhance current                        efforts.  Five groups of twenty- five outstanding                               African-American scholars would be financially and                              academically supported, through the bachelors degree, with the                  understanding that they will continue on to a graduate or                       professional degree.  Each student will receive strong                          academic enrichment and support beginning with a summer                         bridge program prior entrance into the University.  A UMBC                      faculty member will work with the student on a significant                      research project and they will be assigned a practicing                         scientist or engineering professional as a mentor.                                UMBC has received individual and corporate support for this                                                                                                   program and is committed to continuing its efforts.  These                      students will form a cadre of talented professionals who will                   move into leadership roles in their chosen fields.  They will                   also provide an additional group of mentor/role models to                       succeeding classes of Scholars.",
