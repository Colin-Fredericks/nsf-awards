 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is the development of compiler                    optimization techniques for high-level languages.  The primary                  programming languages used today (C, Fortran and Pascal) are not very           high-level.  A large portion of the effort in writing software in               these languages is devoted to hand-tuning the individual application            to the target machine, a process that is both costly and error-prone.           Higher-level languages that abstract away many of the implementation            details have been developed but are not yet in widespread use.  In              spite of the benefits that higher-level languages promise, history              suggests that they will not come into general use until programs                written in them perform as well or better than those in existing low-           level languages.                                                                     Optimization of object-oriented programming languages, one class           of high-level languages, is the major concern of this proposal.                 Object-oriented programming introduces two types of inefficiencies.             First, many more subroutine calls are required than in normal                   programming methodologies.  Second, these subroutines are typically             more general than the code necessary to implement the function in               line.                                                                                Optimization of object-oriented programs primarily involves                tailoring instances of subroutines to the context in which they are             invoked.  Automatic tailoring requires much more powerful analysis and          transformation techniques than are generally available today.                   Developing analysis and transformation techniques to do the tailoring           of these programmer-constructed abstractions is the main focus of this          project.",
