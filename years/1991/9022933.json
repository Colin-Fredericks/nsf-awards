 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the Massachusetts               Institute of Technology supports a broad range of interactive and               interdisciplinary materials research in four primary thrust                     areas.  Research on transition metal oxides addresses                           high-temperature superconducting materials and mechanisms,                      focussing primarily on the magnetic structure and transport                     properties of pure and doped single crystal cuprate                             superconductors.  Researchers in the phases and phase                           transitions group are examining phase transitions in structured                 fluids and the development of statistical mechanical models for                 their theoretical description.  The thrust area on synthesis,                   properties and morphology of novel polymers addresses the                       molecular structure and microscopic morphology of polymers and                  their associated electrical, optical and mechanical properties.                 A new thrust on structure and transport properties of grain                     boundaries and interfaces aims to determine the intrinsic                       structure and properties of high-angle grain boundaries in ionic                compounds and oxide ceramics.                                                        The MIT MRL also supports the development, operation and                   maintenance of major central research facilities including a                    surface science facility operated in conjunction with the Harvard               MRL.  It also provides seed funding for exploratory research and                supports educational activities that include the provision of                   research experience for undergraduates.  The program currently                  involves about 29 faculty members and senior personnel from seven               academic departments, 10 postdoctoral research associates, 41                   graduate students and 20 undergraduates, and supporting                         scientific and clerical staff.  The MIT MRL is directed by                      Professor Bernhardt J. Wuensch.",
