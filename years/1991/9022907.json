 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support continued collaborative research in                     nuclear astrophysics between US and Belgian physicists.  The                    US group is under the direction of Dr. William Rodney,                          Georgetown University. The Belgian collaborator is Dr. J.                       Vervier, Institute for Nuclear Physics, Louvain.  The                           objective of this project is to carry out a program of                          experiments using radioactive beams to measure cross-sections                   important to understanding nucleosynthesis.                                                                                                                     In novae, supernovae, X-ray bursters and possibly in the                        early universe, the temperature and density were such that                      the lifetimes of some radioactive (and isomeric) nuclides                       were comparable to the burning times for their destruction by                   proton or alpha particle induced nuclear reactions.  In                         these instances, these reactions must be taken into account                     in developing models for stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis.                 Thus, the potential for the use of radioactive targets and/or                   beams is receiving increasing attention in the nuclear                          physics community.  In this project, proposed experiments                       represent a major step in the direction of providing the                        needed cross-section information.  The Louvain-la-Neuve                         coupled cyclotron facility will be able to produce the                          required beam intensity to carry out the experiments.  There                    are no existing US facilities capable of such radioactive                       beam measurements.  The research will benefit from Dr.                          Rodney's expertise in nuclear astrophysics and the background                   of his research group in active nuclear experimentation.  The                   results of this research will contribute to our understanding                   of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis in stars.",
