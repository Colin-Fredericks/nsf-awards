 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry will purchase a HE Ne laser for use                 in the undergraduate laboratory.  A laboratory course in laser                  spectroscopy for undergraduate junior and senior science majors                 will be developed.  The goal of this course is to give students                 the opportunity to study a special topic in more detail than is                 possible in their science courses and, at the same time, to                     provide an enjoyable laboratory experience.  The course is                      divided into three sections.  The first section will involve                    the use of a He Ne laser with a collection of optical                           components to study the properties of laser light.  Also, the                   chemical processes of lasing action will be explained.  In the                  second section, students will explore the uses of two types of                  laser spectrometers, a continuous-wave system using an argon                    ion laser source and a pulsed system using a nitrogen-pumped                    dye laser.  In the last section, students, in small groups,                     will be given one or two projects which will make use of the                    above laser systems.  The projects will involve solving a                       stated problem rather than following a cookbook procedure.  The                 object of this approach is to encourage students to think                       creatively and to interact with other students in solving                       problems.",
