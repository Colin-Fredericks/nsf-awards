 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographic research has been extremely dynamic in recent decades,            making the quadrennial congresses sponsored by the International                Geographical Union (IGU) extremely important settings at which                  geographers and scholars in related disciplines meet to exchange the            most recent results of their research and to plan future collaborative          activities.  The 27th Congress of the IGU will be held in Washington,           D.C., in August 1992, providing an excellent opportunity for American           geographers to meet directly with colleagues from other parts of the            world.  This award provides support for the 27th International                  Geographical Congress (IGC) in two ways.  First, it provides financial          assistance from NSF to offset costs of planning and operating the               congress.  Second, it provides a means through which other federal              governmental agencies may provide financial support through interagency         agreements that will fund supplements to the initial award.  This award         is effectively a renewal of NSF Award SES-9000186, but it is made as a          new award because financial responsibility for administration of the            award now will be handled directly by the Organizing Committee of the           27th IGC.                                                                          This award will provide valuable financial assistance for the                planning and operation of the largest and most significant gathering of         geographers from throughout the world.  As has been true with past IGU          activities, enhanced scholarship and increased involvement in                   international collaborative activities by American geographers will             result.  Further positive consequences of this grant will be realized if        NSF can assist in channelling contributions from other federal agencies         to this important activity.",
