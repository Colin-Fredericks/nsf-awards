 "awd_abstract_narration": "For devices with submicrometer dimensions and                                   densely packed integrated circuits, low processing                              temperature is essential.  While most of the                                    fabrication steps can be carried out at low                                     temperature, the only exception is the formation of                             dielectric layer.  To obtain low temperature                                    dielectric materials for different applications, we                             propose using electron cyclotron resonance (ECR)                                source for deposition and growth.  The high                                     efficiency for gas dissociation and excitation                                  provided by ECR source allows the activation                                    energy to be lowered and high density of reactive                               radicals to be generated.  There are two additional                             new thrust for the proposed work.  The effect of                                selective excitation and dissociation will be studied                           by adjusting the gas injection to the two gas inlets:                           one by the ECR cavity and one around the sample                                 stage.  The second focus is on controlling the                                  surface reaction by timing the arrival rate of the                              reactive species.  By providing control of these                                parameters, high quality films, new dielectric                                  materials, and effective step coverage for high                                 aspect ratio features can be obtained.                                          There are three objectives of this proposed project:                            (1) deposition and growth of low temperature gate                               dielectric, the focus is on high electrical quality and                         reasonable deposition rate for single wafer                                     processing; (2) deposit planarized dielectric for                               multilevel interconnections, a major issue is on high                           degree of global planarization and good electrical                              properties; (3) reaction time control for conformal                             step coverage of high aspect ratio features with                                uniform thickness.",
