 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of vertebrate muscle development presents exceptional                 opportunities for the investigation of gene regulation during                   complex ontogenetic processes.  During myogenesis both tissue-                  specific and developmental stage-specific gene switching occur,                 culminating in the formation of the two major types of skeletal                 muscle: fast-twitch and slow-twitch myofibers.  Each of the                     muscle fiber types is characterized by the expression of unique                 combinations is contractile protein isoforms.  The establishment                of muscle fiber type arises from the interplay of factors such as               cell lineage, type of innervation the myofiber receives, and the                level of circulating hormones.  Whereas much progress has been                  made in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for                  muscle-specific gene expression, almost nothing is known about                  differential myofiber-type-specific gene expression.  Dr Wade                   proposes to investigate the mechanisms regulating myofiber-type                 specific gene expression through the study of the human troponin                I gene family.  The adult slow-fiber TnI gene is differentially                 expressed during embryonic muscle fiber formation, and can serve                as a model for the developmental regulation of fiber-type-                      specific gene expression.  He has cloned the human skeletal                     muscle TnI slow gene, and has identified multiple cis-acting                    sequences required for its muscle-specific expression by the use                of in vitro transient expression assays.  These studies have                    identified a muscle specific enhancer which is not trans-                       activated by the myogenic regulatory factor MyoD1.  He will                     further characterize the muscle-specific regulatory elements and                extend these studies to examine muscle fiber-type-specific gene                 activity.  The mechanisms underlying fiber-type-specific gene                   expression will be investigated in vivo by the novel approach of                directly introducing TnI gene constructs into specific fast and                 slow twitch muscles in mice and rats, and by the development of                 transgenic mice carrying hybrid TnI gene constructs.  The in vivo               expression of these TnI gene constructs will be monitored by CAT                activity assays, RNase protection assay,and by in situ                          hybridization of gene specific probes to cross sections of muscle               tissue.  These in vitro and in vivo expression studies will                     assess whether specific cis-acting sequences can confer muscle                  fiber-type-specific gene expression  and evaluate the role of                   trans-acting factors in the process.  The putative trans-acting                 factors regulating fiber-type-specific gene expression will be                  characterized by gel mobility shift assays, and DNA footprinting                techniques.  If such factors are found, he will clone                           representative cDNAs from expression libraries.  These studies                  will be among the first to examine the molecular mechanisms                     regulating muscle fiber type development and maintenance.",
