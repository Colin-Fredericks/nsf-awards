 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an increasing need for low cost electron accelerators which            are compact, efficient and capable of operating at high current and             power levels in the energy range of 10-1000 MeV.  We propose to                 perform research on the new Induction Synchrotron Accelerator (ISA)             concept with the objective of meeting this need.  The ISA operates by           recirculating an electron beam pulse ( 30 ns long) through induction-           type acceleration cells which are driven by a pulse generator at  10            MHz.  The closed-orbit, transport magnet design is similar to that for          conventional synchrotrons, and beam pulses are injected and extracted           using kicker magnets.  An ISA can be recycled at up to  5 kHz to                generate high average beam powers.  The key issue for the ISA concept           is achieving the required pulse repetition rate over many                       recirculations.  We propose to develop a new pulse generator concept            based on the use of high-speed, power-MOSFET switches combined with             magnetic pulse compression techniques.  The following research tasks            will be performed in Phase I to assess the technical feasibility of             the ISA concept:  (1) demonstrate that switches formed using series-            parallel arrays of power-MOSFET devices are suitable for ISA                    applications; (2) perform experiments to characterize and evaluate a            small-scale ISA driver circuit and (3) develop a conceptual design for          a Phase II proof-of-principle ISA experiment.  If successful, this              work will verify the technical feasibility of critical aspects of the           ISA concept.",
