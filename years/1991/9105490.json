 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summitville is a classic example of the acid sulfate type of ore                deposit, but deep drilling shows that there are \"porphyry-type\"                 vein stockworks and alteration at depth beneath.  The deep                      mineralization has not been carefully studied or dated.  This                   project is to describe in detail the veins and alteration of the                deep mineralization and to date them (K-Ar on sericite and                      alunite) and the shallow alunite associated with gold.  It should               be possible to establish the nature of the relationship of the                  \"porphyry-type\" mineralization to the shallow copper-gold and the               relation of both to other occurrences of enargite-covellite lodes               such as those in Butte, Montana.  Another aspect is numerical                   modeling of covellite-enargite-gold precipitation by the newly                  recognized process of boiling with decreasing pH.                               Magmatically-derived waters with admixed meteoric waters will be                used.  It is also planned to model processes of mixing and wall                 rock reaction.  A clear understanding of the processes of ore                   precipitation and wall rock reaction in acid-sulfate-type                       epithermal ore deposits should be established.",
