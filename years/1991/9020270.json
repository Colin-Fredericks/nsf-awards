 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to develop a class of decentralized dynamic                    processes designed to converge to equilibria.  These processes                  may also be regarded as distributed algorithms for computing                    solutions of systems of equations--the equations that                           characterize equilibrium.  Unlike most dynamic processes that                   have been used to study stability of mechanisms, these processes                are not given by differential or difference equations.                          Furthermore, these processes need not be temporally homogeneous.                Some characteristics of this class of dynamic processes are:  i)                There is an agent, personifying an institution such as an                       organized market, or a central computer, who plays the role of                  coordinator; ii) no agent, including the coordinator, knows                     anything about the equilibrium equations of other agents; iii)                  the coordinator selects and announces points of the message space               to the other agents, referred to as private agents.  iv) no                     private agent is required to evaluate his equilibrium function,                 but only to determine its sign at a given point m.  For example,                in the setting of a market, it is easier for an agent to estimate               whether a given allocation gives him more than he wants (positive               excess demand) or less (negative) than to quantify the precise                  amount by which the allocation differs from his demands.  No                    other computations are performed by the private agents.  The                    researchers will explore new processes of this type for both                    linear equations, and nonlinear equations.",
