 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of                 the Chemistry Division involves experimental investigations into                two major areas of chemical dynamics:  1) extending studies of                  intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) in real                  time to reactive systems in the electronically excited state; and               2) developing a new approach for looking at dynamics on ground-                 state potential energy surfaces in real time.  The time scale of                these studies is in the picosecond to femtosecond regime.  The                  mode specificity, time scale and nature, role of rotations and                  collisions, and influence of symmetry on IVR will be targeted.                  The focus of the reactive dynamics will be on state-to-state rates              of elementary reactions, the effect of total energy, mode                       specificity, and the role of angular momentum on reaction rates.                %%%                                                                             Until recently it was not possible to follow molecules in the                   process of exchanging energy or reacting to form products.                      Chemists deduced the forces and energies involved in collisions by              examining the state of the interacting species before and after                 the collisional event.  Professor Zewail has been a pioneer in                  developing time-resolved techniques which allow an unequivocal                  picture of collisions as they happen.  Such studies are important               because they help answer some fundamental questions in chemistry:               how do reactions occur, and how does the released energy of                     reaction dissipate?  The proposed work examines some of these                   questions.",
