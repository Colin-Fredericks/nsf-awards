The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,                  and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise                    and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                             This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research                    visit by Dr. Bruno Nardi of the University of Michigan Ann                      Arbor with Dr. Marie-Lise Chanin at the Service d'A\u001aronomie                     of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.  The                       researchers will build an operational Doppler lidar system                      to measure wind in the 10-60 km altitude range of the middle                    atmosphere.  This new French technique is the only ground-                      based method of obtaining continuous wind measurements in the                   middle atmosphere with very high spatial and temporal                           resolution.  Wind measurements are necessary to understand                      the dynamics of this poorly monitored atmospheric region and                    its dynamic coupling to adjoining atmospheric regions.                          Besides participating in the construction of this instrument,                   Dr. Nardi will help develop and implement analysis techniques,                  and participate in a collaborative American-French effort to                    validate the High Resolution Doppler Interferometer \u0131HRDI!,                     now in the final stages of preparation at the Space Physics                     Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan, to be                        deployed in the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite \u0131UARS!.                                                                                                     The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the                      U.S. home institution.",
