 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the underlying mechanisms by which                    drugs affect the contraction of smooth muscles.  Smooth muscles                 are the type of muscles that line blood vessels, cause the                      movements of the walls of the stomach and intestine, and control                the opening and closing of the pupils of the eye.  These muscles                as important as they are for normal blood pressure, digestion,                  and vision in humans, are nevertheless considered to be more                    \"primitive\" than skeletal or cardiac muscle.  Smooth muscles are                the main type of muscles in lower organisms, such as snails or                  worms, where they can be studied with fewer technical                           difficulties than in vertebrate animals.  Understanding the                     mechanisms by which endogenous substances or drugs control the                  contraction of these muscles may help us better understand                      hypertension, blindness or problems in digestion.  One substance                found in both humans and lower animals is serotonin, which is                   released by blood clots and can contract blood vessel walls and                 amplify the effects or other contractile substances, thereby,                   exacerbating the effect of the clot.                                                                                                                            This research studies the mechanism by which serotonin amplifies                the contraction of smooth muscle in the sea snail, Aplysia.                     Methods have been developed to isolate smooth muscle cells so                   that the contraction and electrical properties of individual                    cells may be studied.  The studies examine the effect of                        serotonin and drugs on these properties.",
