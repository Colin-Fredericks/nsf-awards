 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Parker will                 obtain detailed fundamental knowledge of the factors that                       determine the reactivity of organic radical ions and doubly                     charged ions in solution. His approach utilizes relationships                   developed for isodesmic reactions to obtain thermodynamic data                  for a variety of reactions directly from reversible electrode                   potential measurements. The thermodynamic data thereby obtained                 will permit prediction of bond dissociation energies and can be                 used to suggest new reactions that are based upon knowledge of                  relative bond strengths in radical ions and doubly charged ions.                %%%                                                                             Organic radical ions are reactive species that possess an                       unpaired electron in addition to an electronic charge. Dr.                      Parker has developed a method that will permit bond dissocia-                   tion energies in these species and in doubly charged ions to be                 determined. This, in turn, will provide a data base for                         determining the energetics of a variety of reactions that                       proceed via intermediate radical ions and doubly charged ions.                  The information thereby obtained will provide fundamental new                   knowledge that is likely to lead to improved understanding of                   the chemistry of these reactive intermediates.",
