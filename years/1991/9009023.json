 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to test a new model of how competition for               food and risk of predation interact to affect primate group size                and structure.  Most models that predict primate group size treat               predation risk and within-group food competition as distinct                    factors which can be measured independently from each other.                    In contrast, Janson proposes a mathematical model in which, for a               given habitat, both an individual monkey's food intake and                      predation risk are functions of four socioecological parameters:                group size, spacing between individuals, time spent vigilant, and               time spent foraging.  Because parameter values which decrease                   risk of predation also decrease food intake, the optimal social                 group size in this model is remarkably independent of the                       intensity of predation, while the other socioecological                         parameters covary with group size in well-defined ways.  Data on                brown capuchin monkey social structure will be collected on four                groups in a low-predation environment in a National Park in                     Argentina, and compared with data previously collected by the PI                on the same species in a high-predation environment in Peru.  The               proposed study will be the first in which differences in both                   food availability and predation risk between populations are                    measured and related to specific differences in social structure.",
