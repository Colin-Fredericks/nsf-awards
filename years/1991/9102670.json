 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ocean sciences instrumentation development project will                    design and build fiber optic sensors for continuous sensitive                   measurements of pCO2 in sea water.  CO2 plays a major role in                   the biogeochemical cycle.  Studying these complicated                           processes require precise quantitative measurements of small                    changes in CO2 in order to understand the extent of the                         ocean's contribution to the global CO2 cycle.                                                                                                                   The advent of optical fibers within the past decade is                          producing an impact on chemical sensor technology.  Optical                     sensors consist of reagents attached to the distal tip of an                    optical fiber that change their optical properties upon                         exposure to a specific analyte.  These sensors are small                        (approximately 200 microns), require no direct electrical                       connection between the sample and sensor, and are free from                     electromagnetic interference.  These characteristics make                       optical sensors ideal for measurements at sea.   This project                   aims to develop deployable instrumentation based on optical                     sensors for continuous sensitive pCO2 measurements in                           seawater.                                                                                                                                                       The project is divided into three parts.  1) Sensor/indicator                   development will be conducted at Tufts.  Novel indicating                       schemes with enhanced sensitivity and internal calibration                      capability will be examined.  2) Laboratory-based                               measurements will be conducted using both research and field                    portable instruments to verify the use of these indicating                      schemes for seawater pCO2 measurements.  This aspect of the                     work will be a collaborative project with Tufts and Woods                       Hole Oceanographic Institution.  3) Shipboard measurements of                   sensors for field proofing will be conducted by Woods                           Hole/Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institution personnel.",
