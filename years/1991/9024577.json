 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Teng-fong Wong and a graduate                     student and post-doctoral associate to collaborate in experi-                   mental and theoretical geophysics research with Professors                      Kenneth Hsu and David Olgaard of the Geological Institute of the                ETH, Zurich, Switzerland.  These investigators share an interest                in the fundamental physics and mechanics of the process of                      dehydration embrittlement in gypsum.  They propose to perform a                 systematic study of the dehydration rate, permeability and                      porosity change in gypsum under controlled conditions of                        temperature, pore pressure, stress and strain rate.  They will                  quantitatively characterize the evolution of the decomposition                  reaction and pore structure using x-ray and electron microscopy                 techniques.  Also, they will analyze theoretically the relation                 among the dehydration reaction, the porosity and the permeability.              Ultimately, this experimental and theoretical work will enable                  them to compute numerically the degree of weakening and embrittle-              ment at the bottom of an overthrust formation such as the Jura                  mountains in Switzerland.  The results of such modelling will of                course be compared with actual geological observations in the                   field.  The collaborators bring complementary expertise and                     facilities to this work that guide the division of labor.  The                  high temperature, high pressure deformation experiments and the                 x-ray analysis will be conducted at ETH.  The microstructural                   observations will be done at ETH and SUNY at Stony Brook.  The                  permeability measurements and theoretical analysis will be                      performed at Stony Brook.                                                                                                                                       It has been recognized from field and laboratory observations                   that the deformation and metamorphism of rocks are closely                      linked.  However, most of this work has been done on low porosity               crystalline rocks for which the inelasticity and failure behavior               are sensitively linked to temperature, pressure and strain rate.                These factors are insufficient to explain the behavior of porous                rocks, such as gypsum, or rocks that have undergone metamorphism.               The decomposition or compaction of water-bearing (hydrous) phases               during prograde metamorphism may lead to embrittlement and                      weakening.  There are further differences in behavior as the                    porous rock is dehydrated.  The proposed  research will investigate             these changes in both \"drained\" and \"undrained\" configurations of               gypsum.  The results will contribute substantially to understanding             the tectonics of sedimentary rock formations.",
