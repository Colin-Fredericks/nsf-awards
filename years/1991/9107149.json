 "awd_abstract_narration": "Practically all organisms-from human beings to bean plants-                exhibit \"circadian rhythms,\" rhythmic fluctuations in all kinds                 functions that have a period of about twenty-four hours.  Plants                have such rhythms, too.  Bean plants, for example, hold their                   leaves horizontally during the day (in a position to catch the                  sun), but hold them vertically along the stem at night, and they                will continue this rhythmic movement even if plants are kept in                 constant light, with no clues as to what time of day it is.  No                 one knows whether this rhythmic leaf movement does the plant any                good, but that is partly because no one knows what benefit the                  plant might get from having its leaves folded along the stem,                   whether rhythmically or not.                                                         The investigators will examine the possible benefit to the                 plant of a rhythmic movement, but in a process whose function is                much better understood than leaf movements.  Leaves are connected               to the air by small pores called stomata, and these pores can                   open and close.  It is well known that the stomata open when the                plants can photosynthesize (during the day, for example), and                   that they close when photosynthesis is unlikely to take place (at               night, for example).  In addition to responses like these to                    environmental changes, stomata also open and close according to                 an internal clock with a period of about twenty-four hours:  they               have circadian rhythms.                                                              Until now, no one has tried systematically to understand how               circadian rhythms affect stomata.  This question is important to                basic science for two major reasons.  First, understanding of                   stomatal responses cannot be really complete without an                         understanding of the rhythmic element.  Second, several                         laboratories are concerned with understanding the basic working                 of the clock that drives circadian rhythms in organisms ranging                 from humans to  single-celled plants, and any circadian research                has some promise for shedding light on this extremely important                 and elusive basic question.  There are also potential practical                 benefits, because research on stomata always has potential for                  agricultural applications.  Stomata control the rate at which                   plants use water, and water use is an extremely important                       characteristic of any crop, particularly in an era of global                    change when breeding and selecting of plants that can survive a                 changed environment take on immense importance.  Finally, the                   research will be done at an undergraduate institution and will                  involve undergraduate students extensively, providing a  valuable               opportunity to educate and inspire them for the career in                       science.",
