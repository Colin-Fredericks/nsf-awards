 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen is a key intermediary product during microbial                    degradation of organic matter in anaerobic ecosystems.  The                     recent development of highly sensitive methods for detecting                    hydrogen in anaerobic systems has raised several new questions                  concerning the control of microbial hydrogen metabolism.  It is                 suggested that competition among anaerobic bacteria hydrogen may                involve the maintenance of partial pressures that are so low that               those organisms performing the less energetically favorable                     reactions are excluded.  This research examines physiological                   mechanisms whereby hydrogen-consuming microorganisms may control                the steady-state, hydrogen partial pressures in anaerobic                       ecosystems.  The hydrogen to be tested is that hydrogen partial                 pressures are determined by the physiological properties of the                 hydrogen-consuming microorganisms and that this directly                        determines the results of competition among hydrogen consumers.                 This hypothesis has been derived from the more general hypothesis               that the steady-state concentration of any intermediary product                 is controlled by the physiology of the consuming organisms and                  independent of the producing organisms.  The specific objectives                are to 1) isolate hydrogen-consuming organisms at hydrogen                      partial pressures representative of those found in natural                      environments and compare their hydrogen uptake kinetics, 2)                     measures concentrations of products and reactants in natural                    environments to determine the energetics of hydrogen a production               and consumption under in situ conditions, 3) monitor hydrogen                   metabolism in defined mixed cultures to determine the mechanisms                controlling hydrogen.  The research is designed to elucidate                    connections between thermodynamic, physiological hydrogen uptake                properties of consuming organisms, and the hydrogen partial                     pressures in natural environments.  The results will further test               a model for competition between sulfate reducers and methanogens                for hydrogen that is based on the concept of minimum substrate                  thresholds.",
