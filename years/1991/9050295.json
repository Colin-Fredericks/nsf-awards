 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, entitled Beyond the Industrial Revolution in                      the Middle School, will provide a teacher enhancement program                   for Middle School teachers. It will be offered for three                        summers to 10 \"Core Teachers\" and 20 regular teachers making                    a total of 90 teachers served altogether. The \"Core Teachers\"                   have the additional responsibility for follow-up activities                     with their colleagues as well as course development for the                     summer program. The program is interdisciplinary and follows                    the broad topic: the industrial society as a manufacturing                      and distribution system for material goods. The emphasis and                    focus will be on several subtopics including production                         engineering, transportation,energy and power, industrial                        chemistry, mathematical tools and the underlying social                         system. The summer program will be three weeks in length.                       Follow-up and evaluation activities are included in the                         program.  The goals of the project are: to provide Middle                       School Teachers with new information outside their own                          discipline and to enhance their ability to work across two or                   more disciplines so as to spark enthusiasm and interest in                      science, technology and mathematics in their students; to                       encourage the teaching of science, technology and mathematics                                                                                                   in the broad context of history and contemporary social                                                                                                         issues across the disciplines as well as in the separate                                                                                                        disciplines; and to develop a model for teacher enhancement                                                                                                     in interdisciplinary studies so that this broad contextual                                                                                                      approach can be sustained within the Middle School                                                                                                              curriculum.
