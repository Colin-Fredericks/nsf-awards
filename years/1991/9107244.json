 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research program is to determine the molecular                 mechanism of cooperative oxygenation in human hemoglobin.                       Dr. Ackers is attempting to decipher the rules and energetic                    driving forces whereby the ten molecular forms (each with a                     structurally-unique combination of ligated and unligatd heme                    sites) respond to the interactions with heme-site lignads and                   small regulatory molecules including protons, chloride ions, and                2,3-diphosphoglycerate.                                                                                                                                         A breakthrough was recently achieved in this problem when                       methods were developed that resolve the functional energetics of                hemoglobin tetramers in all ten states of hemesite ligation,                    using non-oxygen ligands.  This has opened the door to obtaining                previously inaccessible knowledge regarding properties of the                   intermediate species and their roles in the cooperative                         mechanism.                                                                                                                                                      In current work studies will be extended to mutant hemoglobins in               order to map the structural pathways of free energy transduction                and to establish the connections with oxygen binding.  This                     research will use a combination of techniques, including                        quantitative low temperature isoelectric focusing, and high                     precision binding of oxygen, protons, and chloride as a function                of temperature and organic phosphates.  The binding measurements                will be correlated with circular dichroic studies of quaternary                 structure.  The results from this research will serve as a model                for studying \"molecular codes\" in other complex regulatory                      protein assemblies.",
