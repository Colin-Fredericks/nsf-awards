 "awd_abstract_narration": "The question of whether dinosaurs lacked effective temperature             control (were heterotherms) or were endothermic homeotherms has                 given rise to much controversy.  Their reptilian character suggests             heterothermy; in contrast, their rise to dominance over early                   mammalian stocks suggests high physiological efficiency -                       homeothermy.  Despite much argument, the criteria considered to                 date do not yield a convincing answer.                                               Such an answer may be obtained from oxygen isotope ratios in               dinosaur bone.  A basic premise, well substantiated, is that the                isotopic composition of bone reflects two variables: the                        composition of the body fluids from which it was deposited, and the             temperature at which deposition occurred.  A second premise, also               well established, is that the isotopic ratios in the body fluids                of an individual are uniform at any one time.  This implies that                any isotopic differences in bone deposited in a given individual                at any time will reflect differences in temperature.                                 Observations to date suggest that in mammals, body                         temperatures vary only slightly between extremities and body core,              whereas notable differences exist in heterothermic reptiles (such               as the Komodo dragon).                                                               Isotopic values will be compared from extremital and body core             bones selected from articulated or partially articulated dinosaur               skeletons.  The results will give the first direct evidence of                  dinosaur thermal physiology.",
