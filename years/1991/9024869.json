 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in systems                       engineering between Dr. Tryphon Georghiou, University of                        Minnesota, and Dr. Malcolm Smith, University of Cambridge,                      England.  The objective of the project is to develop novel                      theoretical tools and techniques for the analysis and                           design of control systems.                                                                                                                                      Specifically, the goal of the research is to develop an                         integrated approach to identification, modeling and control                     for linear dynamical systems.  The approach is based on the                     notion of a graph of dynamical systems.  Uncertainty,                           perturbations and modeling error are measured by the gap                        metric.  The gap metric is a notion of distance between                         systems suitable for use in the context of robust stabiliza-                    tion and control.  This notion of distance is independent of                    any particular representation (e.g. state-space, transfer                       function, or any special system of coordinates) and applies                     equally well to the most general class of infinite-dimensional                  distributed parameter systems (e.g. flexible structures).                       The proposed research will focus on quantitative estimates                      of modeling/identification error/uncertainty measured by the                    gap metric and their effect on stability/performance of                         feedback systems.  The immediate impact of this research is                     expected to be in the development of new control design                         methodologies. The development of the gap metric, as a tool                     for analysis and design of robust control systems, has been                     the main theme of recent work of the two investigators. The                     project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the                    investigators in control theory and their history of past                       successful collaboration.",
