 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbonyl compounds play central roles in the photochemistry                and organic chemistry of the atmosphere, but little is known                    about their concentrations and cycling.  Nearly all past                        measurements of carbonyl compounds in clean air over remote                     regions were restricted to formaldehyde, even though other                      carbonyl compounds were probably present at similar or higher                   concentrations.  The main objectives in this project are to                     elucidate the major sources and sinks of a wide variety of                      carbonyl compounds in the remote troposphere and to quantify                    these roles in tropospheric chemistry.  To achieve these goals,                 the PI plans to perform intensive measurements of background                    concentrations of gas and aqueous phase carbonyl compounds, and                 to study their variations with respect to chemical and                          meteorological conditions.  The work will be carried out as a                   part of the Mauna Loa Observatory Photochemistry Experiment II.                 The simultaneous measurements of key compounds and parameters                   during this program will provide significant new information                    needed for modeling tropospheric chemical processes, which in                   turn will provide new insights into the relative importance of                  carbonyl compounds in tropospheric chemistry.",
