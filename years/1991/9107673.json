 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mounting concerns about accelerating global human and                      environmental change highlight the need for creation of new databases           to analyze processes of change and for greater use of extant databases.         This award provides partial funding to enable a group of roughly 20             social and natural scientists from Pacific Rim nations to meet in               Honolulu in May 1991 to address fundamental issues related to global            change data collection, access, and use.  The conference will have two          general purposes:  (1) to specify data needs and the availability of            databases to address questions relating to human, natural, and physical         dimensions of global change in the Pacific Rim; and (2) to discuss              problems dealing with the scholarly use of these data, with special             attention given to issues of national sensitivities, proprietary                rights, systematic biases, longitudinal extensions, remotely sensed             data, and adaptability of data for use in geographic information                systems.  The primary findings of the conference will be reported in a          special article in a major scientific journal.                                       The conference will further understandings of fundamental data             needs to examine processes of global change by comprehensively                  examining a broad range of data needs and related data-use issues for a         restricted geographic area.  The conference should highlight remaining          problems and provide suggestions for future actions by independent              scholars and institutions, including government agencies.",
