 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the workshop is to consider the current state-                 of-the-art in text analysis, retrieval and understanding, and to                draw a plan for how the field of information retrieval can meet                 the opportunities and challenges of the nineties and beyond.  To                achieve this objective, the workshop will bring together                        designers and users of information retrieval systems from                       academia, industry, and government agencies.  The attendees are                 drawn from the information retrieval, natural language                          processing, and various research communities that represent the                 emerging technologies like hypertext/hypermedia, large text                     databases and dictionaries.  The workshop is expected to identify               the most significant technology pull factors that will serve as                 the driving forces behind the future text processing                            technologies.  Furthermore, basic research that should be                       fostered to fully exploit these technologies will be identified.                The workshop will lead to the preparation of an advisory report                 containing recommendations for the research community, industry,                and funding agencies. It is planned to publish this report in                   widely disseminated journals like SIGIR Forum.  In addition, each               participant will be required to submit a position paper.  The                   position papers will be published as the workshop proceedings.",
