 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical morphology has been becoming an increasingly                    important and often-used technique in image processing and                      machine vision applications during recent decades.  Nevertheless,               the iterations of morphological operations exist a bottleneck in                implementation on a pipelined parallel architecture.  The                       objectives of this project are to propose a set of new                          morphological operators, called back-propagation morphology,                    which is different from the traditionally defined morphology for                solving time-consuming iteration problems, and to develop its                   underlying theorems, algorithms and architectures for various                   vision applications.                                                               First-stage experiments show that the back-propagation                       morphology has the advantages of deriving a root of a signal                    which only requires two scans without numerous iterations and                   being suited for parallel architectures.  It is anticipated that                the proposed research program will lead to fundamental advances                 in the theoretical understanding of the new back-propagation                    morphological operations.  The algorithms and architectures                     developed and the research findings produced by the project will                also have substantial utility for industry in advancing machine                 vision inspection and recognition technologies.",
