 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laminations of gypsum sand and silt, eolian and lacustrine                 clay, and organic-rich material occur on a scale of millimeters in              late Pleistocene/Holocene lake sediments in the Estancia Basin in               central New Mexico.  A feasibility study has established the                    seasonal character of the laminae and their potential for                       reconstructing a high-resolution chronostratigraphy.  The vertical              and lateral continuity of the laminations provides a basis for                  reconstructing a stratigraphic sequence on a decimeter scale and                a time-series with a temporal resolution ranging from decimeter                 decades to centuries.  Changes in the proportion of eolian,                     lacustrine, and biogenic components reflect changes in water depth              and volume, wind intensity, and in the hydrologic balance of the                closed lake system.  Reconstruction of a high-resolution                        stratigraphy will eventually permit the measurement of the                      hydrologic response to climatic forcing and quantitative estimates              of changes in climatic variables.                                                    Methods applied elsewhere to the reconstruction of varve time-             series will be adapted to reconstruct a time-series based on                    accumulated thickness and composition of bedding and laminations.               These parameters will be measured in closely spaced samples,                    indexed to an age model for the reconstructed time-series, and                  expressed as sediment flux.  The radiocarbon chronostratigraphy                 will be refined with additional analyses.  The high-resolution                  stratigraphy in the central area of the basin will be correlated                with shoreline deposits to connect the stratigraphic record to an               improved hydrologic/climatic model for the Estancia Basin.  In                  addition, the investigation will compile a record of eolian influx              and will help develop methodologies for reconstructing high-                    resolution stratigraphic records in other lacustrine basins.",
