That is, it is important for the parser                 to assign reasonable structures to many strings of the language.                Wide coverage has not been achieved in spite of many person-years               of effort.  The grammars of wide coverage of the language gets                  better.  This project will demonstrate that this bottleneck can                 be avoided by an efficient parser that is designed to accept a                  superset of the language.  The problem that such systems have                   encountered in the past comes not from the acceptance of                        ungrammatical strings, but from the detection of spurious                       ambiguity in grammatical strings.  This problem is avoided on the               present approach by using new and more powerful disambiguation                  strategies based on a more systematic representation of semantic                properties and commonsense knowledge than has been available                    before, together with powerful automatic reasoning techniques.                  Phase I will specify the design of this system in detail and use                a careful assessment of prototype performance to establish the                  feasibility of the proposed design for commercial applications.                 In Phase II the specified design will be built and tested in                    target applications.",
