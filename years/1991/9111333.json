Its purpose is to assess the                                           status and trends of Japanese                                                   research and development in selected                                            technologies, thus contributing to                                              enhanced scientific and technological                                           cooperation between the United States                                           and Japan.                                                                         JTEC assessments are performed by                                            panels of U.S. technical experts from                                           industry, academia, and government                                              and are based on analysis of public                                             literature and extensive tours of                                               Japanese laboratories.  The focus of                                            the assessments is on the status and                                            long-term direction of Japanese R&D                                             efforts relative to those in the                                                United States.  Panel findings are                                              disseminated by workshops where                                                 participants critique the preliminary                                           findings, professional journal                                                  articles, conferences, and reports                                              available from the National Technical                                           Information Service (NTIS).                                                        This proposal describes a plan for                                           study of Japanese and European R&D in                                           six more technologies.  The detailed                                            research will be done by six expert                                             panels that will analyze foreign                                                literature, visit foreign                                                       laboratories, and present their                                                 findings in workshops and in                                                    technical reports.",
