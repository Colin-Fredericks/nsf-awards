 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are several components of the scientific process that are                 difficult to convey in the classroom. These include                             experimental design, testing of hypotheses, analysis and                        interpretation of data and the excitement of discovery. The                     department is preparing a model semester-long laboratory                        program in developmental biology which incorporates these                       components and in addition fulfills four specific teaching                      goals. That is, 1) to \"demystify\" science by allowing students                  to use state of the art technologies 2) to provide an                           opportunity for real discovery by addressing an actual research                 question 3) to illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of                       science by using a variety of techniques to answer specific                     questions and 4) to learn to communicate ideas and to think                     critically by organizing results in a final research paper. The                 department is requesting equipment to complete four                             workstations for investigation of cellular structure and                        function in neurons of leech ganglia by dye iontophoresis,                      immunocytochemical localization of neurotransmittors and                        electrophysiological characterization of neurons. Included in                   these workstations are dissecting stereomicroscopes,                            micromanipulators, audio speakers, oscilloscopes and MacLab A/D                 - D/A hardware and software for data collection on Mac SE                       computers. Other pieces of the workstations are presently on                    hand - DC amplifiers, air tables and computers. The pieces of                   equipment also are for use by several other courses in the                      biology curriculum and will enhance the potential experiments                   possible for student independent research projects, honors                      research, and suffer research opportunities which include                       students from other institutions. This proposal will                            significantly enhance the advanced training of more than 100                    young women scientists per year, many of whom can be expected                   to continue study at the graduate level.",
