 "awd_abstract_narration": "The propose is to build an experimental software system to test the             feasibility of mathematically formalizing physically realizable                 microprocessor architectures and to test the feasibility of                     mechanically checking the correctness of system software written                in microprocessor machine language for such microprocessors.                    Although in principle such formalization and checking are possible,             they are widely suspected to be practically infeasible.  However,               a few recent experiments do demonstrate that a new approach of                  directly formalizing a machine architecture as a mathematical                   function in a mechanized logic offers promise.  A substantial                   fraction of a commonly used processor has been formalized and                   several machine code programs have been rigorously checked                      mechanically.  The initial prototype of the system will be used (a)             to test the feasibility of proofs of compiler correctness and (b)               to explore the development of a formalized programming environment              for system software, with focus on such issues as formalizing                   memory management and rigorously demonstrating performance figures.             The experiment will involve formalizing, in a mechanized logic, the             user instruction set of several commonly-used microprocessors, and              will also involve formalizing the semantics of some system traps.               The work will explore new areas in formalization, including cache               consistency, memory protection, and interrupts.  The machine                    architecture issues of proving correct high level language                      compilers. will also be explored.",
