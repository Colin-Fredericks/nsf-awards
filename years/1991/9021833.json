 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award           from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Columbia                  University for the renovation and repair of the William S. Black                Research Building of the College of Physicians & Surgeons, which after          the modernization, will house structural studies, a multi-disciplinary          research and research training program in molecular biophysics.  This           building was constructed in 1965 and has not previously been renovated.         The ARFMP grant of $700,000 and $903,000 provided by the grantee as cost        sharing will be used to modernize these research and research training          facilities.  It will make possible new research capabilities and                collaborative interaction not possible under current conditions.  This          project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure by conversion of research and research training space so         as to permit consolidation of related work in structural biology and by         upgrading the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) so that         it is suitable to meet the demands of x-ray diffraction and of the              computer facilities.                                                                                                                                            This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an         improved environment for the conduct of research and for the training of        quality undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students and for              fostering academic-industrial ties.  Students trained in these                  laboratories will be able to serve as models for the feasibility of the         training of computer-literate molecular biologists.",
