 "awd_abstract_narration": "Few contemporary issues are as threatening of the domestic order                and stability of the United States as that of the race relations.               As a consequence, Political Scientists have invested heavily in                 research on the nature, dynamics and determinants of racial                     attitudes in America.  To date, however, virtually all of this                  research has focussed on the attitudes of white Americans.  Very                little attention has been given to the racial attitudes of blacks.              This research replicates a major 1968 survey of racial attitudes                in the racially diverse Detroit metropolitan area in order to                   develop longitudinal data on the changing racial attitudes of both              white and especially black Americans.                                                                                                                           Specifically, this research will use data on racial attitudes over              the past quarter century to test an enhanced theoretical model of               black racial attitudes, develop a more comprehensive understanding              of black's perceptions of racial discrimination, and examine the                nature, extend, and causes of these attitudes over time.                        Examination of white racial attitudes in the same community will                serve as a valuable point of comparison.                                                                                                                        When completed this ambitious project should greatly increase our               understanding of the nature and direction of race relations in the              United States and provide a better foundation with which to address             any remaining obstacles to the improvement of these relations.",
