 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed planning activity will enable the applicant to prepare             a cDNA library of the Turnip mosaic virus and develop viral mutants             and probes as well as other reagents required for a longer term                 research plan directed toward establishing the gene sequence, the               protein structure and the function of the turnip mosaic virus                   movement protein.                                                                                                                                               Turnip mosaic virus is a member of an agriculturally important and              widespread group of plant viruses.  These viruses occur worldwide               and infect all vegetable and ornamental plants of the mustard and               cress family.  These viruses are transmitted by many species of                 aphid.  When viruses are inoculated onto host plants, either by a               feeding insect or by an abrasion, the initial infection is limited              to a single or few cells of the plant.  In order for the virus to               successfully infect the entire plant, movement from cell to cell                is necessary.  This movement involves the plasmodesmata, which are              membrane-lined pores extending through the cell walls and                       connecting adjacent plant cells.  A virus-encoded factor termed the             \"movement protein\" is also required.  The movement protein of                   another plant virus has been shown to increase the effective size               of the channels between cells, and this is thought to facilitate                movement of virus from cell to cell.  The movement protein of                   turnip mosaic virus probably has a similar function.  The wide-                 ranging turnip mosaic virus and its movement protein are excellent              candidates for genetic manipulation for crop protection, but the                molecular biology of this system also has the potential for                     providing new information on the biology of plant-virus                         interactions, the structure and function of the plasmodesmata and               the molecular biology of plant virus replication.  The goal of the              proposed planning activity is to lay the experimental groundwork                for determining the structure of the gene encoding the turnip                   mosaic virus movement protein and ultimately studying its function.",
