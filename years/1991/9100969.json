 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis                        (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, is an international research                     institution supported by National Member Organizations in 15                    countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union,                       Eastern and Western European nations, Japan, and Canada.  The                   focus of its research is on complex, policy-relevant problems                   that transcend the interests of single countries.  These                        problems include several that have particular significance                      for the United States, including, problems associated with                      the global environment, with demographic change, and with the                   transition of Eastern European countries to market economies.                   In December, 1989 the President determined that IIASA                           continues to do useful scientific work and merits continued                     support by the United States.  As subsequently emphasized by                    the President's Science Advisor, that determination required                    that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the US                          National Member Organization for IIASA, should work with the                    National Science Foundation and other interested Government                     agencies to identify appropriate research areas and funding                     arrangements for IIASA.  In response to the Science Advisor's                   expectations, the American Academy has established a new U.S.                   Committee for IIASA chaired by Dr. Robert White, President of                   the National Academy of Engineering.  The primary purposes of                   that committee are to: (1) increase U.S. scientific partici-                    pation in research at IIASA, and (2) to assure that IIASA's                     research directions and the quality of the research it                          conducts are consistent with the interests of U.S. science and                  the U.S. Government.  This award will support the activities                    of that committee.",
