 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon State University will receive partial funding for                        acquisition of an inductively-coupled plasma mass                               spectrometer(ICP-MS).  This new analytical capability will be                   established within the Dept, of Oceanography for broad use                      within the University.  ICP-MS is a relatively new technology                   that is useful in the analysis of many types of geophysical                     fluid and solid samples and greatly facilitates the detection                   of certain elements such as barium, cobalt, and noble metals.                   Samples are introduced into an argon plasma after vaporiza-                     tion by one of several processes including laser excitation.                    The plasma is then subsampled by the mass spectrometer,                         separated into discrete mass regions, and focused onto an                       electromultiplier detector.  The instrument can detect more                     than 70 elements in the sub-part-per-billion concentration                      range and is able to measure major and trace elements                           simultaneously, thereby reducing analysis time.  ICP-MS                         generates a mass spectrum and its sensitivity and versatility                   lends itself to a wide range of scientific applications                         ranging from geochemistry, to paleooceanography to ceramic                      chemistry.  The new instrument will serve a number of NSF-                      sponsored investigators at OSU.  The University and the U.S.                    Dept. of Energy are providing substantial cost-sharing for                      the establishment of this capability.",
