Six local societies will be studied to answer                       questions about the effects of demographic variables on marriage                choice and the resultant patterns of residence and behavior.  The               project will test the hypothesis that choice of spouses will vary               between communities with local population size and distribution                 as well as age structure, sex ratios and family size.  Previous                 studies of the effects of marriage choices and preferential                     mating rules did not record detailed demographic data, so the                   interaction between demographic processes and marriage rules                    could not be intensively studied.  Methods include participant                  observation, structured interviews, and in-depth interviews with                family heads.                                                                                                                                                   Most demographic research is on large scale societies, yet basic                data from simple societies is important to test theories of human               demographic function and social evolution.  This research will                  also be valuable to decision makers interested in family planning               in the tropic world.",
