 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding printed documents is an intelligent activity.  This               research is about automating one aspect of analyzing a document                 image and deriving a high-level representation of its visual                    content.  Documents contain photographs and accompanying text.                  This effort is concerned with arriving at an integrated                         interpretation of the communicative unit consisting of                          photographs and their captions.  When text describes salient                    aspects of a photograph, it is possible to use the text to direct               a vision system in understanding the photograph.  There are two                 components to this research:  the first deals with language                     issues and the second with development of a vision subsystem.                   Methods of extracting visual information from text, specifically                cues required to identify salient objects, are to be studied;                   such information may be present in a variety of forms, based on                 both syntax and semantics.  The role of textually extracted                     visual cues in performing visual object recognition is also to be               studied.  As a test of the theory, it is proposed to develop a                  system where the result of parsing a caption of a newspaper                     photograph is used to identify human faces in the photograph.                   The face location subsystem will incorporate scale invariant                    techniques, and filters that characterize faces based on the                    presence of distinguishing visual features.                                      //",
