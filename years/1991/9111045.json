 "awd_abstract_narration": "The layered approach to system design has become popular in                     designing correct systems because of the ease of visualizing the                execution as a sequence of processes each resulting from the                    execution of a layer.  This research aims at a lighter-weight                   approach compared to sequentialization of processes.  It defines                a notion of communication speed as it is relevant to distributed                systems, and a hierarchy of communication speeds as an alternative              to sequentialization of processes.  It also defines some                        synchronization abstractions that combine the concept of hierarchy              of communication speeds and some channel primitives.  These                     abstractions result in the same ease as sequentialization of                    processes and are expected to improve the system efficiency in a                layered system.  They are also useful for designing concurrent                  programs.  This research has several objective. 1) Develop a                    framework of thinking based on speeds of communication.  2) Develop             some implementations of these abstractions. 3) Develop a scheme for             decentralized control using hierarchical channel Primitives.  4)                Implement a distributed operating system using hierarchical channel             primitives and evaluate its performance.  5) Develope concurrent                algorithms that use and a concurrent programming environment that               supports hierarchical channel primitives.",
