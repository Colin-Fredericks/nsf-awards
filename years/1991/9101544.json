 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Warren is supported by a grant from the                            Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to use shaped laser                     pulses to orient or align molecules in a molecular beam, to                     generate population inversion in low-temperature crystals, and                  to localize energy in a bond by a photon-locking experiment.                    One of the thrusts of the research program is the development                   of techniques to efficiently populate an electronically excited                 state with a single laser, or to transfer population to highly                  vibrationally excited levels of the ground state with two                       lasers.  The motivation for this work is the study of                           collisional dynamics which require selective excitation to                      monitor velocity changing collisions.  Complete population                      transfer enhances the signal and minimizes interferences.                       Success in transferring large fractions of the thermal                          distribution into high vibrational states will be useful for                    exploring the kinetics of chemical reactions.  One goal is to                   design radiation fields which drive diatomic molecules in their                 ground state to a superposition of rotational states such that                  the diatomic molecule is oriented in the laboratory.  A                         demonstration of the effect of modulating the dissociation rate                 of the IBr molecule  by Stark shifting previously stable levels                 with specific frequency-swept pulse shapes will be the first                    step towards applying this technique to polyatomic molecules.                   %%%                                                                             By preparing specially tailored pulses of light, it is possible                 to produce simple and interpretable states of molecules.  These                 techniques will be used by Prof. Warren  to control their                       alignment in a molecular beam and even their orientation in the                 laboratory, and to modulate the rate at which they break apart                  into fragments.",
