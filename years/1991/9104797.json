 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the proposed multidisciplinary                         research is to determine the basic physiologic signaling                        processes mediating brainstem mechanisms involved in                            coordinating neural, endocrine and behavioral determinants of                   nutrient homeostasis and ingestive behavior.  Specifically,                     the proposed research will focus on brainstem mechanisms                        mediated by the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) - its                       central role as an integrating site in the brainstem for                        coordinating neural and humoral nutrient-related signals with                   the consequent production of appropriate viscerobehavioral                      response patterns.  Our general hypothesis is that the                          integration of nutrient-related information and the                             coordination of appropriate homeostatic response patterns by                    the NTS occurs at both the afferent limb and the efferent                       limb of the neural organizational network mediating feeding                     behavior, nutrient homeostasis and metabolic regulation.  The                   general hypothesis exploits the observation that the NTS is                     not only the principal recipient site in the CNS of first-                      order afferent input from the vast array of visceral sensory                    receptors involved in nutrient homeostasis, but the NTS also                    has extensive direct reciprocal connections with virtually                      all structures at every level of the neural axis involved in                    nutrient homeostasis, metabolic regulation and  feeding                         behavior.  Thus, our specific hypotheses are that the NTS                       subserves the following multiple roles in nutrient                              homeostasis:  (1) a chemosensory role for nutrient-related                      signals in the blood or CSF, likely mediated via its                            association with the area postrema (AP); (2) an integrative                     role for coordinating visceral sensations mediated by both                      neural and humoral signals transmitted to the NTS mainly via                    the vagus nerve; (3) a major role as an autonomic control                       center in the brainstem for the production of \"short-loop\"                      homeostatic response patterns; and (4) an effector role for                     some components of feeding behavior.                                                                                                                            The two Black American and three White American scientists                      who work on this project, will employ a multidisciplinary and                   collaborative research strategy with investigators                              working cooperatively so that NTS-mediated mechanisms of                        nutrient homeostasis can be simultaneously examined at                          multiple levels of analysis - from events occurring at the                      cellular and tissue level to relatively complex appetitive                      responses at the behavioral level.",
