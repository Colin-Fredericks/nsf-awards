 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technology has transformed the world.  Yet technology affects                   society differently in different cultures.  One needs only to                   examine the differences in housing, in heating systems, in                      appliances (even in toilets, as illustrated in the novel \"Fear of               Flying\"), in order to see how society shapes as well as is shaped               by technology.  In order to understand this interaction of                      technology and society, it is critical that we see these forces at              work in a number of different settings.                                                                                                                         In this project, Professor Bray is investigating specific ways in               which technological systems relate to various types of power                    relations and cultural features within a society, taking pre-modern             China as an example. She stresses the role of technology as a                   cohesive force embodying relations of production as well as                     interacting processes of technological processes of technological,              social, and cultural change.  Historians of Western technology have             brought considerable sophistication to such analyses, but these                 methods have not as yet been systematically applied to China.  She              is also applying approaches to technology developed by social and               cultural anthropologists.                                                                                                                                       Under this grant, the principal investigator is examining a                     restricted number of topics grouped around three thematic headings:             divisions of labour (e.g significance of the household as the                   predominant unit of production;  the contributions of women to                  production); culture mental and material (e.g. the implications of              scarcity; how architectural forms reflect cosmological beliefs and              social practice); forms of control and the exercise of power (e.g.              water control; the importance of standardized measures; access to               medical expertise).  Eventually, Professor Bray hopes to develop                this approach into a systematic treatment of technology in Chinese              society and culture.",
