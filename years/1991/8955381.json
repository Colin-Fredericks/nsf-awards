 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has revealed that students typically fail to assimilate         the scientist's framework as a result of instruction, in part because           they come to science class with concepts that are different from the            scientist's.  This project aims to provide both detailed analyses of            student starting conceptions and an understanding of some instructional         conditions that promote conceptual change.                                                                                                                      The investigators seek to understand the difficulties 6th and 7th grade         students have in assimilating the physicist's macroscopic theory of             matter:  a theory in which mass, volume, and density are all distinct           but inter-related properties of matter or material kinds.  They                 hypothesize that students possess an alternative macroscopic theory of          matter of some coherence-one in which student's failure to differentiate        mass and density is supported by alternative conceptions of matter and          material kinds.  They also hypothesize that providing students with             visual conceptual models is a good way to promote reorganization of             their matter theory.  These models provide students with a way of               visually representing concepts which provide students with a way of             visually representing concepts which are themselves not \"seeable\",              building on visual analogies that have the same relational structure as         the abstract physical concepts.                                                                                                                                 The investigators will test their hypotheses through teaching studies           and clinical interviews with junior high students in both suburban and          inner city classrooms.                                                                                                                                          The research will contribute to an understanding of the detailed process        in which visual conceptual models help students' conceptual change.  The        specific problems students have to overcome, the kinds of conceptual            models that are most effective, and the ways students' may facilitate or        impede their ability to benefit from a model based curriculum.//",
