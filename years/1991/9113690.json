 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shape from shading is a central, difficult problem of machine                   vision.  Although its formulation is precise, its solution has                  usually been considered ill-posed, possible only with additional                assumptions.  In recent papers, however, the PIs gave the first                 proof that shape form shading is not only well-posed but solvable               uniquely, for general objects, when the illumination is from the                direction of the camera.  For general illumination direction, it                was shown that the solution is determined effectively up to a                   finite ambiguity.  Thus, regularization the standard technique                  for selecting a single `physically reasonable' surface solution                 by imposing additional requirements such as smoothness is                       generally unnecessary.  The aim of the proposed research is to                  develop and implement algorithms for surface reconstruction                     without regularization, which, unlike previous algorithms, will                 explicitly utilize the strong constraints on the surface                        solutions that make shape from shading well posed.  Through                     exploiting these constraints, the algorithms may be fast and                    robust.  Two of the four algorithms proposed are non-variational                unlike most previous ones, and are based on the novel                           mathematical techniques of the viscosity solution, and dynamical                systems theory.  The long term aim is to combine shape from                     shading algorithms with techniques using other information, such                as sparse depth data, for robust surface reconstruction from                    shaded images.//",
