 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with supported molybdenum sulfide, cobalt-                   promoted molybdenum sulfide, and tungsten sulfide catalysts                     prepared by the decomposition of the respective thiosalts in                    hydrogen or helium.  The activities of such catalysts, as                       determined by suitable test reactions, are compared with those                  of catalysts having the same metal content but prepared by                      conventional methods.  The effects of various pretreatments on                  total area, oxygen chemisorption, and activity are                              investigated.  Pretreatments include the removal of excess                      sulfur by temperature-programmed reduction or by reductive                      sulfiding.  Correlations between oxygen chemisorption and                       catalyst activity are obtained for various sulfur contents as                   well as for catalysts prepared in each of the atmospheres                       (hydrogen or helium) for decomposition of the thiosalts.                                                                                                        Supported sulfide catalysts play a vital role in coal                           liquefaction and in the petrochemical industry.  Active                         sulfide catalysts are conventionally prepared by converting                     the respective oxides to sulfides, but this is often difficult                  and does not proceed in a regular manner.  This work explores                   the utility of catalysts prepared by a different technique                      that may yield more uniform and more active catalysts.",
