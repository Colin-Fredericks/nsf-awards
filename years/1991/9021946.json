 "awd_abstract_narration": "Different primate species are characterized by differing patterns               of dispersal.  It is generally felt that the dispersal pattern is               an adaptation which may increase the selective fitness of                       individuals by increasingly their likelihood of mating and hence                passing their genes on to subsequent generations.                                                                                                               Both chimpanzees and baboons are present in the Gombe Forest of                 Tanzania and each demonstrates a different dispersal pattern.                   Among chimpanzees, about half of the females leave their natal                  group permanently and half leave temporarily.  Among the baboons,               it is the males who emigrate but the age of first dispersal                     varies from 3 to 9 years.  Additionally, some female baboons                    leave their natal range at the time when groups divide.                                                                                                         In order to attempt to understand the costs and benefits of the                 different patterns, the PIs will cooperate with Jane Goodall in                 the use of her detailed field notes; notes which extend back for                as much as 20 years.  In addition, they will extend the studies                 of both species at Gombe for the next three years by direct                     observation.                                                                                                                                                    In cooperation with Tanzanian scientists, they will also test the               relationship of the richness of the habitat to the dispersal                    patterns by initiating new studies on the plant species                         distributions within the ranges of each species.",
