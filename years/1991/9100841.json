 "awd_abstract_narration": "A successful animal (in the evolutionary sense) is one that                     behaves so as to maximize the representation of its genes in                    future generations.  Therefore, an animal can be successful                     either by raising its own offspring, as usually occurs, or by                   helping to raise offspring that are closely related to itself, as               occurs in most \"cooperative breeders.\"  For example, adult                      helpers at the nests of mated pairs of birds are often helping                  their parents raise offspring that are their own full siblings.                                                                                                 In the stripe-backed wren of Venezuela, males and females raised                in a given social group become helpers in the same group when                   they mature.  Since the mortality rate is high and dominant                     females that die are replaced by immigrant females unrelated to                 the group, helpers often help raise juveniles that are their half               siblings.  Thus, the death of a dominant female and her                         replacement by an immigrant is a significant event for a male                   helper.  His mother's death (1) suddenly decreases the genetic                  benefit he enjoys by helping to raise offspring of the dominant                 pair (since the female is no longer his mother) and (2) creates                 an opportunity for him to reproduce non-incestuously by mating                  with the new dominant female.  Recent behavioral research                       revealed that male helpers routinely pursue and attempt to court                dominant females unrelated to them and are only kept from mating                with dominant females by dominant males.  DNA fingerprinting, a                 molecular technique used to assign parentage, has shown that 15%                of all juveniles from groups that contain male helpers unrelated                to the dominant female are offspring of male helpers and dominant               females.  The remaining 85% are offspring of the dominant pair.                                                                                                 Dr. Piper's research project will compare in more detail the                    behavior of male helpers that are sons of the dominant female and               those that are unrelated to her.  Specifically, he will examine                 the tendency of male helpers to associate with dominant females,                the treatment of male helpers by dominant males, and the amount                 of parental care given by male helpers.  This study will increase               our understanding of helping behavior and incest avoidance in                   cooperatively breeding animals and, more generally, will give                   insight into the evolution of helping behavior.",
