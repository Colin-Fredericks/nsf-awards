 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the proposed research is the development               of a thermo-mechanical framework for the analysis of large plastic              deformation and failure modes in layered metallic crystalline                   materials on the physical scale required in the fabrication of                  microelectronic and opto-electronic devices.  Cracks, voids, and                surface flaws have severely limited the synthesis and the                       processing of layered structures needed in the fabrication of                   electronic components.  The proposed thermo-viscoplastic                        theoretical and computational formulation will provide realistic                predictions of damage accumulation and material instabilities in                artificially structured materials.  In the proposed analysis, an                investigation of material failure modes that arise due to non-                  uniform large plastic deformation modes, the growth and the                     coalescence of voids, and the distribution of stresses, plastic                 strains, and temperatures near the interfaces of the layered single             crystals will be undertaken.  Based on the thermo-mechanical                    characterization of failure, methodologies will be suggested for                the damage-free layering of metallic crystalline structures.  A                 successful accomplishment of these proposed objectives would                    provide a more fundamental understanding of the inherent                        crystalline constraints on the layering of artificially structured              materials.",
