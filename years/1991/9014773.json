An international group of botanists, ecologists, conservation                   biologists, and horticulturists will convene for four days of                   papers, round-table discussions, and public lectures on                         aspects of epiphyte biology and conservation.  The meeting                      will foster exchange of information across lines of individual                  disciplines, geographical areas, and plant taxa.  Special                       emphasis will be on conservation of epiphytic plant species                     and their habitats:  speakers will present reports of \"case                     studies\" of conservation activities where these plants are                      native and threatened.                                                                                                                                          Products from this Symposium will include a research                            publication of selected talks, a set of information pamphlets                   for the general public on aspects of epiphyte biology and                       conservation, a set of specific recommendations for the                         conservation of epiphytes and their habitats generated in the                   round-table discussions, a compilation of epiphyte-related                      literature, and a mailing list for future communication among                   those who study, cultivate, and conserve epiphytes.  Particular                 emphasis will be placed on promoting international collabora-                   tion and information exchange with scientists from Latin                        America and other regions of the world with native epiphytes.",
