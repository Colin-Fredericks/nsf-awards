 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators plan to develop HAILFINDER,  a                           knowledge-based system for forecasting severe weather in                        Northeastern Colorado.  Until recently most knowledge-based                     systems have been based on production rules,  frames,  or                       various non-standard logics.  A fourth approach is now                          emerging which uses hierarchical Bayesian inference and other                   related techniques to perform diagnoses,  draw conclusions,                     answer questions,  and produce forecasts.  HAILFINDER will be                   the first such system designed for a natural science domain.                    Its purpose will be to compare the performance of normatively                   designed knowledge-based systems with that of rule-based                        systems and with expert performance.  The National Oceanic                      and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will collect and                          provide extensive weather information and supply the experts                    for a competition among systems for forecasting severe                          weather that it will conduct in the summer of 1992.                                  HAILFINDER's research team is comprised of four                            investigators who embody a variety of skills that are well                      suited to meeting the needs of this task.  The project has                      the potential of using the specific weather application to                      yield results of substantial scientific significance.  Even                     if only partially successful,  it promises to provide a more                    solid footing for the use of probabilistic expert systems as                    practical tools.",
