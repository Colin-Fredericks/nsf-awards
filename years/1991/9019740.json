The project                       involves the negotiation of social identity through the strategic               use of language among Arabs and Jews in Haifa, Israel.  The                     project will investigate how social groups form and transform                   their identities in everyday interaction through the strategic                  manipulation of language.  Objectives include collection of a                   representative sample of speech recorded in natural settings;                   eliciting the pragmatic meaning associated with variation in such               speech; and analyzing the power relations being negotiated in                   such interactions.  Results will contribute to social and                       linguistic theory and will address practical issues of achieving                harmonious social relations in Israel.",
