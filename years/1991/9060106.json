 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR project examines a new and innovative                                 method of implementing a receiver that has superior                             performance over that of conventional receivers in                              rejecting interference.  The improved interference                              rejection allows the transmitter to use less power to                           achieve the required bit-error rate performance, and                            hence reduces the probability that the transmitter will                         interfere with other users of the spectrum.  The new                            receiver, called the optimal time-dependent receiver                            (OTDR), is developed by considering a receiver as a                             time-varying filtering process.  The OTDR is an                                 adaptive time-varying filter that is optimized to handle                        changing signal conditions and nonstationary                                    interference.  The superior performance of the OTDR                             is obtained by exploiting the cyclostationary nature of                         the interference.  The OTDR is capable of performing                            down conversion, equalization, multipath rejection,                             interference rejection, baud sampling, synchronization,                         and symbol conversion all within the same operation.                            The OTDR can be configured to handle a variety of                               modulation types, all using little or no additional                             hardware, and thus is capable of numerous and varied                            modes.  The OTDR is implemented using digital signal                            processing techniques and the hardware can be made                              small, reliable, and maintenance free.                                                                                                                          The objective of this SBIR project is to determine the                          theoretical and experimental performance of the                                 OTDR in several realistic commercial situations.  The                           evaluation will include determining the trade-off in the                        OTDR system design.",
