 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in ecology                       between Dr. Robert Antibus, Clarkson University and Dr.                         John Dighton, Merlewood Research Station, Institute of                          Terrestrial Ecology, Cumbria, England.  The objective of                        the project is to investigate  hydrolytic enzyme production                     by ectomycorrhizae collected in different age forest stands.                                                                                                    Mycorrhizae are mutualistic associations formed between                         roots of higher plants and fungi.  Most commercially                            important temperate zone trees form ectomycorrhizae.                            Numerous species of fungi are capable of forming ectomycor-                     rhizae with a particular tree species.  However, little is                      known about factors that affect fungal distribution and how                     different fungi influence tree growth. The concept of                           ectomycorrhizal fungal succession has recently been studied                     by researchers in England.  They have shown that as trees                       age, the species of ectomycorrhizal fungi fruiting in a stand                   change. The proposed studies will be conducted in different                     age class stands of Sitka spruce in England.  Dr. Dighton                       at the Merlewood Research Station has collected background                      data on these stands for several years.  During this                            project, Dr. Antibus will spend two field seasons at                            Merlewood. The proposed work will bring together Dr.                            Antibus' expertise in ectomycorrhizal enzyme research with                      Dr. Dighton's work on fungal succession and phosphorus                          uptake in relation to tree nutrition.  Valuable information                     will be gained from this study relative to the function of                      ectomycorrhizae in forest nutrient cycles.  The information                     obtained and methods applied will be important to forest                        ecologists and managers in many parts of the world.",
