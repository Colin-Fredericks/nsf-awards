Lavine and other members of the Chemistry                    Department at Clarkson University are being supported to                        conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in                 Chemistry.  During the summer of 1991, eight undergraduate                      students will spend eight weeks actively engaged in a variety                   of research projects.  Many of the projects are concerned with                  colloid chemistry, such as investigation of the stability of                    lyophobic colloids or plasma modification of fine particles,                    but projects are also available in chromatography,                              spectroscopy, and other areas.  During the first week of the                    program, students will be introduced to research techniques and                 instrumentation.  Students will prepare a progress report and a                 final report on their research and will give an oral                            presentation on their results.",
