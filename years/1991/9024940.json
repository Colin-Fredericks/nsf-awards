 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rosensteil School of Marine Science at the University of                    Miami will acquire several items of oceanographic                               instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use                            equipment.  This equipment is maintained for use on or in                       association with the two research vessels operated by the                       university.  A substantial part of the ships' operating                         schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research                    projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the                           capabilities of the ship and of the University to support                       research and engineering activities.  The instrumentation                       includes:                                                                                                                                                       -Newly developed Rosette water sampler to improve the                            collection of discrete seawater samples at specific water                       depths,                                                                        -Water sampler bottles for the new Rosette system, -                            Microcomputer system upgrade and other peripheral equipment                      for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing capabilities,                   -precision temperature sensors for the CTD,                                     -Precision acoustic altimeter for use in determining the                         precise position of a scientific instrument package relative                    to the seafloor, and                                                           -Terminal server for enhancing scientific data transfer and                      communications amongst scientific users of the ship,                           -Salinity bottles for storing seawater samples,                                 -A precision salinometer for determining the salinity of                         seawater,                                                                      -Electronic reversing thermometers for calibrating deep sea                      temperature measurements,                                                      -Electronic analytical balance, and                                             -Piston corer barrels for collecting profiles of seafloor                        sediments.                                                                                                                                                     The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored                           research and engineering projects.",
