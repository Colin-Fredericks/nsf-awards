 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mu is a fascinating bacteriophage whose genome replicates as a DNA              transposon.  Mu has been extensively studied and now serves as a                model system for transposable elements and viruses.  Mu has also                became a valuable genetic tool for many biological applications                 including insertion mutagenesis, gene transduction and                          translocation, chromosome marking and mapping,  DNA cloning, DNA                sequencing, and gene fusing for studies of gene expression and                  regulation.  These genetic applications also serve as models for                applications of other transposons and viruses in different                      biological systems.  Further studies and applications of Mu and                 related phage are proposed, with extensions to other bacterial                  species.  Specifically, 1) the targeting of Mu transposition will               be studied with fusions of the Mu B gene to the DNA binding protein             gene lacI, 2) the rfa host receptor genes for the Mu and related                phage will be studied in Escherichia coli and Salmonella                        typhimurium to understand their surface requirements for the                    lipopolysaccharide receptors and 3) the knowledge of their receptor             specificities will be used to extend the host range of these phage              and their applications to other Enterobacteriaceae.",
