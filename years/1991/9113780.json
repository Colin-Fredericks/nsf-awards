 "awd_abstract_narration": "Competitiveness in the manufacture of computers and computer               chips depends on many capabilities including the ability to design,             analyze and manufacture the uniquely structured thin films that                 make up electronic devices.  Transport phenomenon such as heat and              mass transfer and ion diffusion and scattering are critical in the              control of chip quality and cost.  This research will enhance                   industry-university collaboration on the modeling and solution                  methods of transport mechanisms for discretely inhomogeneous,                   multi-dimensional media (electronic thin-film devices).                              A unique modeling and analysis approach called discrete                    element analysis will be developed with the potential to enhance                present efforts to integrate geometry, analysis, design and                     manufacturing to improve engineering efficiency and effectiveness.              The important role played by transport processes in manufacturing               will be highlighted throughout with active knowledge transfer                   mechanisms between the university and industrial collaborators.",
