 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the roles theoretical computer science is to develop an                  algorithmic theory for various application domains.  This                       research is motivated by some practical problems in computer                    vision and molecular biology.  The main motivating problem in                   computer vision is that of searching aerial or satellite                        photographs.  In this investigation, the problem is abstracted to               several \"pure\" subproblems  - local errors, scaling, and                        rotations - and efficient solutions are sought.  The research                   then attempts to synthesize the subproblem solutions and obtain a               general algorithm.  The tools for the solution involve techniques               that give rise to more general algorithmic and data structure                   problems.  This research also addresses problems stemming from                  molecular biology.  Recently, several researchers presented                     efficient dynamic programming methods for determining the RNA                   secondary structure.  New information shows that the secondary                  structure is more involved than originally thought.  The                        researchers are investigating whether the problem is now NP-                    hard.  The answer to that question will determine if efficient                  algorithms or efficient approximations to its solution will be                  sought.",
