 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to define the mechanisms                      involved in regulation of transcription of bacteriophage Mu. Mu                 early transcription is carried out by host function; middle                     transcription requires Mu functions and replication; late                       transcription requires the middle operon product C.  This project               will involve (1) isolation and analysis of phage containing                     middle operon mutations, (2) definition of the role of a                        transactivator protein Tam in activation of the middle promoter                 Pm by cloning of the tam gene, overproduction and purification of               Tam protein, and characterization of its mechanism of action in                 an in vitro transcription system and (3) determination of the                   role of DNA replication, overlapping transcription termination,                 and specific DNA binding proteins (Mu repressors, transposase,                  and host IHF) on Pm activation by S1 nuclease and Pm-lacZ fusion                analysis under differing  levels of replication, termination and                binding proteins. The results should provide a detailed                         understanding of the mechanisms of transcriptional control                      exhibited by this novel bacteriophage, and thus should enhance                  our knowledge regarding this important target for cellular                      regulation.",
