 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the history of technology, nothing is more mysterious yet more               central that the act of invention.  Technological historians,                   however, have yet to develop a precise interpretation of how an                 inventor identifies an opportunity, develops a new idea, and                    manifests it in a physical device.  In response to this conceptual              lacuna, Drs. Carlson and Gorman are comparing how Alexander Graham              Bell, Thomas A. Edison, and Elisha Gray developed the telephone                 from 1870 to 1880.  They have chosen to focus on these inventors                because their work is well documented by notebooks, sketches, and               artifacts and because their efforts to perfect this invention have              received limited scholarly attention.  To analyze and compare the               works of these inventors, they are drawing on recent work in                    cognitive science.  In particular, they are considering three                   elements of the cognitive process of invention:  how an inventor                conceptualizes an invention (mental model);  the strategies he or               she uses to develop an invention (heuristics); and the specific                 technical devices he or she uses to construct an invention                      (mechanical representations).  Through this research, they expect               to enrich the history of technology with a new conceptual framework             and a detailed study of a major invention, suggest to cognitive                 scientists how technological creativity may be effectively studied,             and help interested laymen see inventors not as mysterious geniuses             but as individuals with specific talents and skills.",
