 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrically conducting organic polymers are a new class                        of low-cost lightweight conducting materials that have a                        large number of important practical applications.  These                        polymers are of particular interest as a means of                               fabricating enzyme-based electrochemical biosensors that                        have unique capabilities.  However, several aspects of the                      electrochemical methods presently used for the formation                        of these polymers as thin films at electrode surfaces                           impose severe restrictions for their use in enzyme                              electrodes.                                                                                                                                                     A radically new method for forming conducting polymers,                         such as polypyrrole, has been developed.   This method is                       highly suited to the fabrication of enzyme electrodes.  New                     methods for transducing the reaction of an oxidoreductase                       enzyme into an electrical signal will arise from this                           approach.  A feasibility study will be performed using                          xanthine oxidase and L-amino acid oxidase to determine if                       it can be immobilized into conducting polymer films formed                      by the non-electrical process.  The activity of the enzymes                     toward their substrates will be examined.  This new method                      will form the basis for the formation of enzyme electrodes                      using a flexible photodeposition technique, and can be used                     for the production of conducting polymers on a large scale.",
