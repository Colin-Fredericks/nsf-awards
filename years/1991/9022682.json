 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a graduate student in cultural anthropology               who is studying the changes in women's roles and status in an                   agrarian region of Colombia.  Using structured community surveys,               intensive life history interviews, and participant observation in               two communities, the student will investigate the hypothesis that               women are increasing in control of valued resources, which will                 affect their roles and status within the household.                                                                                                             This research is important because economic development often                   leads to a decrease in the status of women, as men control more                 resources which yield money incomes.  By studying a regional                    economy where women may be increasing their economic status, the                case will contribute to our knowledge of how women's status may                 be maintained and improved while maintaining economic                           development.",
