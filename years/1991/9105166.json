This ongoing work has been the                    result of collaborations with undergraduate and graduate                        students.  It has been applied in the proposer's research on the                geometry of piecewise circular curves and on highly symmetric                   combinatorial structures on the complex projective plane.                       Preliminary versions of this research program have been used to                 provide the illustrations for proposer's Scientific American                    Library book and several articles, as well as the images used for               Mathematics Awareness Week.                                                                                                                                     The P.I. and his assistants intend to continue the development of               this system, and to apply it to extensions of the problems, as                  well as other problems in the geometry of submanifolds.  The work               of the P.I. has interest to the mathematical Sciences community                 at large, as well as to mathematics educators.",
