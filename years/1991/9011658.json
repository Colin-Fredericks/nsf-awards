 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a third phase of the University of                      Colorado Long-Term Ecological Research program.  It builds upon                 research in alpine processes and patterns related to disturbance                conducted during Phase I and Phase II of the program.  Field                    studies will be continued at Niwot Ridge and in the Green Lakes                 Valley with selected studies in the wider region of the Colorado                Front Range.  The goal of this research is to understand the                    influence of snowpack and summer precipitation on ecosystem                     processes and landscape patterns and to use this understanding to               predict responses to climate change.  The central hypothesis is                 that alternation of snowpack or rainfall regimes will cause                     changes in alpine ecosystem processes and patterns at site and                  regional scale.  The alpine tundra is often thought to be                       sensitive to climate change and is known to have responded to                   such changes in the 12,000 years since deglaciation.  The reasons               for this sensitivity are its low productivity and tight nutrient                cycling and its situation at an extreme for many plant processes.                                                                                               In Phase III of this project emphasis will be place on further                  experimental studies of ecosystem processes and patterns and                    their modeling as a means of predicting the effects of altered                  showpack and summer precipitation patterns.  In particular, scale               considerations will be emphasized hierarchical approach.  Remote                sensing will be used to examine regional primary productivity                   along elevational and climatic gradients in the Front Range and                 to facilitate extrapolation from the primary study site at Niwot                Ridge to other alpine areas.  This theme derives from that of                   Phase I, which was based on the premise that present alpine                     ecosystems reflect past climatic conditions and Phase II, which                 focuses on the resilience and resistance of tundra systems.  Many               of the databases derived from this earlier work will be crucial                 to our Phase III research and will be maintained for the next six               years.",
