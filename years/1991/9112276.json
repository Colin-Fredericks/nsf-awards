 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analytical equipment for phase equilibrium research on three                    specific projects will be acquired.  The first project has to                   do with the thermodynamic properties needed to make                             intelligent choices for industrial water pollution reduction,                   water remediation, and for estimating the fate, transport and                   bioaccumulation of chemicals.  The second project concerns the                  reduction of automobile air pollution emissions by the                          reformulation of gasolines, i.e., the production of \"clean\"                     gasoline.  The key blending components in such gasolines may                    be oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as methyl tertiary butyl                       ether (MTBE) as these compounds have been found to increase                     octane numbers of gasolines while reducing polluting emissions                  of the oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide.  Research                        currently underway, for which some equipment is needed, is on                   the phase behavior of the oxygenate + hydrocarbon systems.                                                                                                      The third project is aimed at developing a predictive design                    model for the purification of biomaterials using aqueous two-                   phase two-polymer systems.  The experimental portion of this                    research deals with dependence of the liquid-liquid phase                       splitting and the biomolecule partitioning on variables such                    as polymer molecular weight and molecular weight dispersion,                    temperature, pH, ionic strength buffer salts used, etc.",
