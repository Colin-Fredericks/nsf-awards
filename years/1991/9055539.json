 "awd_abstract_narration": "EINSTEIN is a series of three prime time television                        programs to be shown nationally on the Public Broadcasting                      Service (PBS).  The series will present a scientific biography                  of Albert Einstein.  The series will treat the life of Albert                   Einstein on several levels.  The central narative thread will                   trace the development and impact of Einstein's work in physics.                 The three programs will examine Einstein's impact beyond                        physics -- as a muse for the arts; a dissident voice in                         politics; a moral sensibility; ultimately as the greatest                       public symbol of scientific accomplishment.  With original                      texts (including newly identified documents from the Einstein                   archives), historical footage, interviews, documentary                          sequences, the most sophisticated computer animation available,                 and other techniques as appropriate, EINSTEIN will present to                   its audience a unique picture of the role of Albert Einstein in                 the making of the modern world.  Beyond its broadcast in 1992,                  the series also will receive wide educational distribution in                   secondary schools and colleges and a large foreign audience.",
