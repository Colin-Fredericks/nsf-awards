 "awd_abstract_narration": "Saline and dilute groundwaters of distinct origin converge and                  mix in two juxtaposed Paleozoic aquifers in Missouri and Kansas.                Research is proposed that will investigate the processes that                   control the flow history and geochemical evolution of                           groundwaters in this large-scale flow system.  Processes to be                  examined include gravity-driven flow, fluid mixing and water-rock               interaction.  This examination will be accomplished through the                 analysis of the waters for a range of chemical and isotopic                     systems, including major and trace element concentrations, H, O,                Sr, Nd, B, U, Th, Pb and Ra isotope compositions, and rare earth                element concentrations.  Models for the evolution of the                        groundwaters will be evaluated using quantitative models that                   simulate chemical and isotopic exchange during the migration of                 subsurface fluids.  The models developed for this flow system are               expected to have significant implications for a variety of                      geologic and environmental issues, such as the origin of basinal                brines and Pb-Zn ore deposits, the transport of radionuclides,                  trace metals and hydrocarbons in the Earth's crust, the                         diagenesis of sediments and the management of water resources.",
