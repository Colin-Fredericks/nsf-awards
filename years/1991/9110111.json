 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software quality assessment, although acknowledged to be of the            first importance, is today an art rather than a science.  Program               testing is the best defined and least subjective component of quality           assurance, but even its methods are poorly related to measurable                quality.  Program testing has two purposes:  (1) to expose software             failures for repair, and (2) to establish confidence that future                failures are unlikely.  The foundational theory must be probabilistic,          because any test is no more than a sample of program behavior.  For             any program P and test method M, (1) What is the probability that M             will uncover a failure in P? (2) After M has been used without                  failure, what is the probability that in fact P cannot fail?  The               purpose of this project is to improve on previous theoretical answers           to these questions.  Prior theoretical work can be characterized first          as being imprecise, in that characteristics of M and P do not enter             the theory in a useful way; and second, as being overly pessimistic,            in that under the best of circumstances the probabilities are very              low.  New theoretical work will be guided by experiments on existing            and new test methods, using novel support tools.",
