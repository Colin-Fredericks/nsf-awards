 "awd_abstract_narration": "BBN Systems and Technologies will conduct a three-and-one-                      half-year program to develop and assess a comprehensive                         teacher enhancement program to foster the strategies, art,                      and practice of mathematical inquiry teaching in middle                         school mathematics classrooms.  The program employs                             interactive computer software and video technology as key                       instructional tools for fostering inquiry learning and                          teaching skills.  The program will comprise four graduate-                      level courses, two of which, Reasoning About Data and                           Mathematical Exploration and Experiment, were developed in                      a recently completed teacher enhancement grant.  The two                        new courses, Animated Geometry and Interactive Algebra,                         will draw extensively on computer activities for supporting                     inquiry teaching.  The courses will be field-tested at the                      University of Massachusetts, Boston; Lesley College,                            Cambridge; and the Educational Collaborative.  Careful                          documentation of the extent to which teachers change as a                       result of these courses will be undertaken.  The courses                        will be endorsed by the Massachusetts Department of                             Education and disseminated statewide by the Massachusetts                       Corporation for Educational Telecommunications.  National                       dissemination will be instantiated through pre-conference                       workshops of relevant organizational meetings such as NCTM                      or AERA.   Over 240 middle school teachers will be involved                     in the development and piloting of these courses.                                                                                                               Logo Computer Systems, Key Curriculum Press, EDCO, MCET and                     BBN cost-sharing accounts for 7% of the NSF budget.                                                                                                             Developing teacher enhancement materials which creatively                       make use of the latest technology is indeed desirable.  BBN                     produces products that are at the cutting edge of                               technology.  And the Massachusetts Corporation for                              Educational Telecommunications provides and excellent                           avenue for dissemination of the course materials so                             developed.",
