 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three dimensional structure of the proteins involved                        in the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase                            system (PTS) will be determined by x-ray crystallography.                       This complex multi-enzyme system is one of the few                              transport systems whose components, including some of the                       membrane bound ones, have been purified.  The                                   crystallography will complement the molecular biology and                       biochemical aspects of a collaborative effect to study                          the mechanism by which bacteria employ a protein                                phosphoryl transfer chain to regulate sugar transport                           across the membrane.  The structure determination of the                        various proteins will facilitate the analysis of the                            nature of regulation by protein phosphorylation, and the                        conformational transition that accompanies such                                 processes.  Since the PTS is unique to bacteria, the                            information obtained may pertain to our ability to take                         advantage of the PTS therapeutically.  At this state, the                       focus is on the soluble proteins.  Similar approaches                           will be used to obtain information about the                                    phosphorylated structures of the other PTS proteins.                            Structure determination will be done either by the                              Multiple Isomorphous Replacement or by the Molecular                            Replacement methods, depending on the problem.  For                             better accuracy, the determined structures will be                              refined to the highest resolution possible.  Once                               structures become available, mutants that probe the                             protein-protein and protein-substrate interactions will                         be designed and analyzed biochemically, and selected                            interesting mutants will be crystallized and their                              structure determined.",
