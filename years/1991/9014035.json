 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support cooperative research in comparative                     physiology between Dr. August Epple, Thomas Jefferson Medical                   College, and Dr. Sepp Porta, University of Graz, Austria.  The                  objective of this project is to improve understanding of the                    function of circulating catecholamine conjugates, and provide                   insights into the completely unknown ontogeny and evolution                     of these conjugates.                                                                                                                                            Recently it has become clear that the cardiovascular chromaffin                 cells of many, and perhaps all, vertebrates produce a complex                   secretory \"cocktail\", whose messenger substances include, in                    addition to catecholamines, peptides and true opiates                           (codeine and morphine).  The interactions between these                         secretions are largely unknown, and they are the subject of                     ongoing research in Dr. Epple's laboratory in the US.  The                      complexity of these interactions is further enhanced by                         circulating catecholamine glucuronides and sulfates, substances                 that have been studied for a number of years by Dr. Porta's                     laboratory in Austria.  Traditionally, these conjugates have                    been considered metabolites destined for excretion.  However,                   it now appears that at least some fraction of the conjugates                    1) are released by the adrenal medulla, and 2) function as                      messenger substances.  The proposed project will apply a                        phylogenetic/ontogenetic approach and will investigate three                    species, whose chromaffin cell systems represent three levels                   in the evolution of the adrenal medulla (lamprey, eel and                       rat), as well as the chicken embryo, whose chromaffin cell                      system resembles that of the lamprey.  The investigations                       will combine the experience of Dr. Epple's lab with lower                       vertebrates and the chicken embryo, and the technical                           expertise of Dr. Porta's lab in the analysis of the conjugated                  catecholamines.  The expected data should provide new basic                     insights into the ontogeny, evolution and function of                           conjugated plasma catecholamines as physiological regulators.",
