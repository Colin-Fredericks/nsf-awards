 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the development of new methods for                       directing the powerful carbon-carbon bond-forming chemistry of                  Fischer carbene complexes for the purposes of organic                           synthesis. It will focus on the cyclopropanation of alkenes                     and several addition/insertion reactions of alkynes. The key                    intermediates are heterobimetallic Fischer carbene complexes,                   in which an electron-deficient metal center is attached to the                  heteroatom of a metallocarbenoxy moiety. By virtue of their                     electron-deficient nature and rapid ligand substitution                         chemistry, Lewis acidic metal substituents will play a fourfold                 role in the chemistry of these bimetallic systems: (1) as a                     template on which to attach substrate molecules bearing a                       ligand \"handle\" to achieve new and useful diastereoselectivity;                 (2) as a site for attachment of chiral auxiliaries to achieve                   asymmetric induction; (3) as a source of intramolecular                         nucleophilic reactivity, allowing stabilized Fischer carbenes                   to be activated by heteroatom displacement: and (4) as a means                  to regenerate the carbene moiety under mild conditions,                         allowing the target reactions to be performed under catalytic                   conditions.                                                                     %%%                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                  Division will support the research of Dr. M. G. Finn of the                     Department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia. The                      research is in the area of syntheic methodology and will                        develop new methods for directing carbon-carbon bond formation,                 one of the most important classes of reactions in organic                       chemistry. The key intermediates in the process are                             heterobimetallic Fischer carbene complexes, which are molecules                 containing two different metal atoms.  These intermediates will                 enable shape-selective control of the reactions.",
