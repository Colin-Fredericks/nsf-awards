 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this grant in the Computational and Theoretical Chemistry                  Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Skodje will study                  the classical nonlinear dynamics of bi-molecular and                            uni-molecular reactions. The work is at a fundamental level                     with its goal being  to understand basic dynamical effects of                   importance in predicting the rates of chemical reactions.                                                                                                       The role of classical phase space structure will be emphasized                  and the nature of reactive transport in phase space will be                     investigated using a new theory for complex decay rates, which                  is based on recent advances in the theory of strange attractors                 and repellers, and gives a systematically improvable method to                  calculate rates. The theory will be especially useful in the                    study of transient species which have extremely short life                      times, roughly comparable to the intra-molecular relaxation                     times. A quantum phase space hydrodynamic model will be applied                 to the problem of multi-dimensional reactive tunneling. The                     multi-dimensional tunneling path will be found directly by                      following the fluid orbits. Also, the notion will be explored                   that quantum chaos can be regarded as turbulence in the quantum                 fluid dynamics. Finally, the role of localization in                            intra-molecular vibrational redistribution and in reaction                      dynamics will be explored by means of quantum maps. Quantum                     maps for reactive problems will be used to determine whether                    localization will suppress (or sometimes promote) chemical                      reaction.",
