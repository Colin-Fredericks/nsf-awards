This is the final research project                                    under the TCCMAR program which will enable                                      the limit state masonry design guideline and                                    analytical model verification to be                                             completed.  The research building under                                         testing consists of a 5-story coupled shear                                     wall structure which will allow a ductile                                       system behavior while providing a complex                                       test bed for so far unanswered analytical and                                   design model verification in areas such as                                      effective width of flanged walls and floor                                      diaphragms, coupling effects of floors, as                                      well as higher mode effects on design shear                                     forces.  The experiments will be conducted in                                   the Charles Lee Powell Structural Laboratory                                    at the University of California, San Diego                                      using the pseudo-dynamic testing facilities.                                                                                                                    The basic objectives of the research are to                                     test the TCCMAR design philosophy and                                           recommendation for seismic reinforced masonry                                   structures and provide a viable experimental                                    verification of the analytical procedures                                       developed.                                                                                                                                                      The research will also provide insight into                                     the higher mode effects as they are                                             encountered in some of the current design                                       practice.  It is also expected to contribute                                    to the development of repair, retrofit and                                      strengthening measures for existing masonry                                     structures.                                                                                                                                                     This project is the capstone of the TCCMAR                                      Program which will be drawn into a successful                                   completion with this project and the                                            concurrent effort in developing the limit                                       state design standards underway through a                                       separate companion project.",
