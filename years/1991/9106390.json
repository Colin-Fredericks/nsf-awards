Research will concentrate on sensitivity of                                     risk to uncertainty in structural resistance,                                   in particular the contribution of                                               nonstructural components; appraisal of                                          current code procedures; and development of                                     alternative procedures for more risk                                            consistent design.  Additional building                                         types, i.e., eccentric braced frame and dual                                    frame systems, will be studied.  Based on the                                   results of the risk study, the Rw factors for                                   different building types will be carefully                                      examined and if needed alternative values of                                    Rw will be commended which are more                                             consistent with safety required for different                                   building types.  Also, design procedures will                                   be developed which provide a given amount of                                    damage control through drift limitation.                                                                                                                        Knowledge to be gained in the seismic                                           behavior or representative building types,                                      cladding, and nonstructural elements to be                                      studied will be most positive.  Results are                                     anticipated to have an important impact on                                      building code development.",
