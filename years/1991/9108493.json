 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most control system design problems involve making                              tradeoffs among competing objectives.                                           In this research we consider a synthesis problem that                           arises when the goal is to find a controller such that                          several design specifications are jointly feasible.  The                        focus is on linear plants and controllers.  We consider                         design specifications that may be quantified by norms                           on the closed loop maps.  The aim is to develop a                               complete state-space theory for solving several multiple                        objective control problems, resulting from combining                            performance measures and robustness requirements of                             practical significance.                                                         Our formulation of the synthesis problem is significant                         because design specifications such as good disturbance                          rejection and tracking, guaranteed stability in the face                        of plant uncertainty, etc., can be taken into account                           simultaneously.  Since a comprehensive theory for                               these problems does not exist, the potential yields of                          this research will enhance the current theoretical                              understanding of some fundamental tradeoffs in the                              design of control systems.  Further, since the synthesis                        methodologies we may obtain capture better aspects of                           the design problem than existing methods (i.e. LQG,                             H-infinity, etc.), their use will result in a significant                       reduction of the time invested by the control engineer                          to get an acceptable controller design.                                         The methods we plan to use are based on linear                                  algebra and finite-dimensional convex optimization.                             We are motivated by the possibility of obtaining                                efficient numerical algorithms for controller synthesis,                        implementable in most computer systems.",
