 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award enables a broad-based, multiple-investigator survey of               insect and arachnid biodiversity in southern South America.  The                arthropod fauna of Chile and Argentina requires this immediate and              detailed attention for at least three reasons.  First, just as with             the rain forests of much of the New World tropics, south temperate              forests are currently being destroyed at an alarming rate, and the              fauna must be sampled, rapidly and exhaustively, while such studies             are still possible.  Second, the fauna includes many taxa of                    special phylogenetic significance; the most primitive members of                many taxa are already known to be endemic to the area.  And third,              the fauna is of special significance to biogeographers, for whom                the interrelationships of south temperate biotas in general have                constituted a major focus of interest and effort for over a                     century.  The survey will allow accurate identification of the                  smallest areas of endemism within Chile and Argentina, and thereby              help separate those forests which need to be maintained in as                   pristine a state as possible from those which can best be used as               sustainable resources without endangering unique elements of the                biota.  The award will fund one graduate student and two                        postdoctoral fellows as well about 118 person-weeks of field work.",
