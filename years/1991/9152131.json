 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a curriculum innovation that promises to                  increase student understanding, productivity, and participation                 in the classroom and shift the focus of the class to more open-                 ended and design-oriented problems.  The equipment requested                    are 30 powerful workstations running Mathematica.  This                         classroom/laboratory is used to teach a year long, Sophomore                    level, Electrical Engineering, Circuits & Systems class                         sequence.Recent NSF-funded projects (both on our campus and                     others) have shown that students learning calculus and                          differential equations in computer algebra equipped classrooms                  have increased productivity, understanding, and participation.                  Installing workstations in an engineering classroom allows                      students to participate actively in the lectures.  The powerful                 plotting routines allows them to visualize the relationships                    between voltages, currents, etc in a circuit.  The computer                     algebra system's ability to manipulate symbolic equations both                  increases the student's productivity and requires less time in                  the lecture for re-teaching manipulative mathematics skills.                    This extra lecture time is used to address design-oriented                      topics such as worst-case studies and sensitivity analysis.                     Finally, student retention in engineering is expected to                        increase since those students who have weaker manipulative                      mathematical skills will be at less of a disadvantage, and                      therefore less likely to drop out.",
