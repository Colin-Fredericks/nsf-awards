Carlton Pryor and Theodore Williams at Rutgers University will             carry out a set of observations to study processes in globular                  clusters of stars.  They will determine the mass functions of stars             and the frequency of binary stars in specifically chosen clusters               for comparison to a more average population of clusters.  The mass              functions will be studied by measuring mass-to-light ratios, and                binaries will be discovered through surveys for stars with variable             radial velocities.                                                                                                                                              The stars in globular clusters represent one of our best samples                of the early generations of stars in our Galaxy.  We study them to              better understand more distant old stellar populations and because              they are among our few clues to conditions during the formation of              the Galaxy.  Globular clusters are also an excellent laboratory for             studying stellar dynamics.  Significant dynamical evolution in the              cluster has already taken place.  This research will address three              questions about globular clusters.  What is the frequency and                   spatial distribution of primordial binary stars?  Has dynamical                 evolution modified the mass function in low-concentration clusters?             How common are steep increases of the velocity dispersion in the                cusps of clusters?",
