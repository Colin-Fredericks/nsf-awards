 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to integrate speech science                      laboratory experiences with basic speech science course-work to                 promote active learning of the physiological processes of                       speech production and their relation to the acoustic speech                     signal.  Laboratory activities have been designed to encourage                  investigation of speech processes and to involve undergraduate                  students in the method of scientific inquiry.  A computerized                   speech lab is requested to enable students to examine the                       acoustic speech signal.  Additional scientific equipment is                     requested to afford students the opportunity to objectively                     measure and quantify the various speech processes including                     respiration, phonation, and articulation.  Through the proposed                 speech laboratory investigations, students will be able to                      enhance their understanding of the intricate relationships                      between speech physiological processes, to develop their skills                 in scientific methodology, and to increase their level of                       preparation for future graduate study.",
