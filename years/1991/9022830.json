 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project conducts an experimental investigation of the                      effects of program trading in stock indices on the volatility of                stock prices and on the informational efficiency of stock                       markets.  In addition, it determines how these effects vary with                the rules which govern trade in the markets.  The research is                   conducted in a sequence of experimental markets.  The initial                   studies examine volatility and efficiency in a market with                      multiple stocks but without any derivative securities.  The                     project then introduces stock index futures.  Finally, program                  traders are introduced.  These studies are conducted in both the                standard double auction market and also in an open outcry market.                                                                                               Experimental analysis of program trading is important and timely.               Currently, at least four major exchanges (including the New York                Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board of Options Exchange) are                   investigating the role of program trading.  The issues of concern               seem ideally suited to an experimental analysis.  The controlled                conditions allow precise measurement of the way program trading                 affects the price volatility and informational efficiency of                    experimental markets.  The research should also enhance our                     understanding of the role of trading rules in the effects of                    program trading.",
