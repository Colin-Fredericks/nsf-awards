 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, chlorocompound/ice and nitrocompound/ice reactions               have been proposed as key heterogeneous steps in the process                    leading to destruction of Antarctic stratospheric ozone.  In order              to understand the role of the ice during the process, there is a                need for new laboratory techniques that (1) yield accurate                      molecular-level data on ice surfaces and associated adspecies and               (2) allow in situ on-surface monitoring of chemistry on ice                     crystals.  Whereas most surface science techniques are not suitable             for high vapor pressure insulating substrates, the new surface                  sensitive laser technique, second harmonic generation (SHG), has                great potential for probing chemistry of this kind.  SHG signals                produced by a tunable, sub-picosecond laser directly yield highly               accurate data such as sticking coefficients electronic spectra and              orientations of molecules comprising a single monolayer on an                   insulating surface.                                                                  SHG will be utilized for the first time on ice surfaces, to                isolate and examine key steps in the stratospheric ozone depletion              chemistry:  adsorption, reaction and desorption processes of                    compounds such as CIONO2 and N2O5.  In order to simulate                        stratospheric ice, a single crystal ice sample is housed in a                   temperature and pressure controlled chamber.  An important aspect               of the study is a novel method for studying the effects of ice                  composition (HCl and HNO3 content) on the reactions.                                 The objectives are to (1) accurately quantify reaction                     parameters at various temperatures from data taken directly at the              ice surface and (2) understand the mechanisms of the surface                    reactions.",
