The proposed experiments will further basic                             understanding of the fundamental properties of liquid                           crystals, which are important in the development of optical                     devices.  Dr. Pines has developed new NMR techniques related                    to liquid crystal research  and Dr. Luzar is expert in                          ferroelectric liquid crystal materials.                                                                                                                         This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through                  a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the                      U.S. and Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is                        provided annually by the Department of State.  No NSF funds                     are involved.  The award, except for funds for U.S. scientist                   travel, is made to the Yugoslav institution.",
