 "awd_abstract_narration": "Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds that crystallize as                        conglomerate mixtures may be optically resolved using the                       technique of direct preferential crystallization.  The method                   is based on the selective deposition of enantiomers from                        supersaturated solution onto optically pure seed crystals                       provided for this purpose.  The technique has inherent                          advantages in its avoidance of the chiral auxiliaries and                       additional process chemistry that are characteristic of other                   methods for producing optically pure drugs.  While                              preferential crystallization has been applied successfully to                   produce several important chiral compounds, it would                            undoubtedly be more widely used were it not for the fact that                   selective crystallization can be a difficult process to                         control on the large scale.                                                                                                                                     It is proposed to examine the feasibility and potential                         benefits of membrane-stabilized preferential crystallization                    for stereoisomer separations.  In the novel process, selective                  membranes are used to confine individual enantiomers and seed                   in such away as to enhance the stability of crystallization                     and thereby to improve process reliability and efficiency.",
