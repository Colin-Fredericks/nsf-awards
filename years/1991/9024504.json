 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is a theoretical investigation into                           the optical wave properties and potential novel                                 utilization of crystals having holographically recorded                         patterns.  These aspects will be considered from the                            perspective of applications requiring large                                     information capacities, such as optical interconnects                           and switches, optical data processing and computing                             elements, neural nets, and other.  In particular, the                           electromagnetic field interactions that take place                              inside such crystals will be explored in order to:  (a)                         characterize and evaluate the actual scattered fields                           produced by predetermined patterns, (b) investigate                             various effects that distort the desired form of such                           scattered fields, (c) assess the intrinsic limitations of                       the scattering mechanism, and (d) formulate optimal                             conditions for achieving optical processes of specific                          interest.                                                                                                                                                       For this purpose, the projected study will employ                               suitable canonic models of crystals containing patterns                         in the form of superposed gratings.  These will be                              examined by a recently developed technique, which                               views the pertinent multiple scattering problem in                              terms of Feynman diagrams that were modified and                                expressed as flow graphs.  By further extending and                             then applying this approach, accurate information on                            the complexity of the diffracted field will be derived.                         In turn, this information will be used to obtain                                qualitative and quantitative data on practical effects                          such as crosstalk interference, signal degradation due                          to crystal imperfections, realizable dynamic range of                           operation, deleterious effects due to interface                                 boundaries, and other performance facets of relevant                            optical applications.",
