 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor John Mullet of Texas A & M                    University in a research collaboration with Dr. Alejandra                       Covarrubias of the Plant Biotechnolgy Center in Cuernavaca,                     Mexico.  The purpose of the research is to identify genes in                    plants that contribute to drought tolerance, drought avoidance                  and water use efficiency.  Identification of these genes will                   allow new approaches to improve drought tolerance in crop                       species.                                                                                                                                                        The researchers will collaborate in the identification of                       genes induced in response to water deficit in Sorghum and                       Phaseolus.  Sorghum will be studied because it is a drought                     tolerant cereal; Phaseolus varieties also share desiccation                     tolerance and the plant is an important source of food in                       Mexico.  The analysis will focus on specific genes and study                    the role of abscisic acid in induced desiccation tolerance.                     In addition, the researchers will map the location of abscisic                  acid modulated genes on the RFLP map of Sorghum to help                         establish relationships between specific genes and drought                      tolerance under field conditions.  The proposed collaboration                   will be of benefit to the U.S. side in extending their                          collection of genes to genes induced in response to more                        severe water deficits and genes responsive to abscisic acid,                    while the Mexican side will benefit from access to the U.S.                     researcher's gene collection and related information.",
