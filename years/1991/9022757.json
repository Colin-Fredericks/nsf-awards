 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent large-scale accidents such as the Chernobyl nuclear plant                radiation release and the Valdez oil spill have underscored the                 importance of studying how we do and should deal with the                       prospect of catastrophes in conditions of scientific uncertainty.               In that light, contingency planning and prevention measures                     require investigation.  This research project focuses on                        contingency planning in organizations. It seeks to understand                   decision making processes of organizations facing the prospect of               technological catastrophes for which there are no control                       measures.  A guiding insight is that as organizations attempt to                rationalize uncertainties and plan for the unknown, they channel                and define societal values.  The investigator will proceed by                   examining two cases, contingency plans for major oil spills and                 evacuation plans for civilian nuclear power plants, through                     intensive interviews and archival investigation.  Building upon                 previous work from several disciplines, the research should shed                light on how some values are promoted and some are suppressed in                the decision making, how expertise is constituted in the process,               and consequences for society of organizational planning.                        Yielding a fuller understanding of decision procedures regarding                extremely difficult problems, the research should be useful to                  policy makers and experts who must plan for low probability, high               consequence events in conditions of great uncertainty.  The book                and articles to be produced by the project should interest these                audiences, as well as scholars in relevant fields.                                                                                                              The principal investigator is highly qualified; the institutional               resources are very good; the issues are important and timely;                   results will be appropriately disseminated.  The project is                     meritorious and recommended for award.",
