 "awd_abstract_narration": "The assembly of continental crust into large continental cratons                typically involves several continent-continent collisions.                      Relatively shallow level parts of such collisions can be addressed              in active or young system such as the Himalaya, however, deep                   portions are only exposed in ancient orogens.  This project, a                  collaboration between Syracuse University and University of                     California, Santa Cruz, will investigate the crustal evolution of               the Archaean Rae-Hearne platform and the bounding Snowbird Tectonic             zone in northeastern Saskatchewan to document Archean and early                 Proterozoic crustal growth and to evaluate the effect of terminal               collision within the orogen at 1.8 Ga.  Because approximately 20                km of crust has bee removed by uplift and erosion, a view of mid-               crustal levels of orogeny will be directly studied.  Results are                expected to help understand not only Archean events in the Trans-               Hudson orogen but also deeper parts of compressional tectonic                   settings generally.",
