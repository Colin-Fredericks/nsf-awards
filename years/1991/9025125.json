The                                        responders are periodically trained through                                     response exercises which provide realistic                                      simulations of possible disasters.  The                                         exercises prepare participants to make                                          decisions, coordinate with others and face                                      extreme situations under extraordinary                                          pressure.  However, after the emergency                                         responders have gone back to normal                                             operations, the tasks of rebuilding are just                                    beginning.  A new set of players faces                                          extreme and unanticipated circumstances which                                   can dominate work for years to come.  This                                      project is designed to help planners across                                     the country who someday may be faced with the                                   immense challenge of guiding the rebuilding                                     of a community damaged by an earthquake.                                                                                                                        The proposed project is to draw upon and                                        expand past work of the principal                                               investigators and others to develop a model                                     timeline of rebuilding after earthquakes.                                       This model timeline will be synthesized from                                    actual timelines of rebuilding constructed                                      for 15 to 18 communities damaged by                                             earthquakes.  It will show the sequence and                                     relationships of key rebuilding actions and                                     decisions pertaining to clearance, repairing                                    infrastructure, rehousing, business recovery,                                   restoration of public facilities, and                                           reconstruction planning.  The model timeline                                    will then be used as the basis for creating a                                   simulation exercise telescoping 10 to 20                                        years of rebuilding activity into a two-day,                                    realistic, interactive learning experience                                      for local planners.  The simulation exercise                                    will be tested with a group of planners                                         invited from around the country, revised, and                                   then described in a report for use by local                                     planning departments.",
