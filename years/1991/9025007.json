 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manufacturing systems are comprised of a complex                                interaction of many entities.  There are several                                service centers, each consisting of several machines,                           and several part-types with possibly different routes.                          The machines may incur set-up times whenever they                               switch between part-types.  The yield of an operation                           may be random, and moreover machines fail from                                  time to time.  Nevertheless it is important to run the                          entire system in such a way as to satisfy prescribed                            production levels for all the part types, and to meet                           the due-dates for all parts as closely as possible, while                       simultaneously keeping work-in-process small and                                cycle times short.  To achieve these goals, the PI will                         need to schedule the entire system, i.e., decide the                            numbers of various parts to be released into the                                system, as well as their release times, and to                                  determine the times of all operations by machines on                            parts already in the system.                                                                                                                                    How does the PI incorporate these myriad details                                coherently in such a way that he will be able to design                         good scheduling policies?  In this proposal the PI will                         detail the beginnings of an integrated system                                   theoretic approach which views manufacturing                                    systems as inherently dynamic entities for which the                            objectives of control are stability and performance.                            He will design and analyze scheduling algorithms                                which can be implemented in real-time.  The ultimate                            objective is to also have an impact on scheduling                               practice, with special attention given to the problem                           of developing good scheduling algorithms for                                    semiconductor manufacturing systems.                                                                                                                            In the final analysis, what the PI seeks is the                                 beginning of the development of a useful and                                    coherent system theory and practice for                                         manufacturing systems.",
