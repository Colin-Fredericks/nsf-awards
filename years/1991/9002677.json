 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to investigate enhancements of real-time                             Gas Electron Diffraction (GED) leading to                                       application of this structure-analytic technique to the                         detection of effluents from Open Tubular Capillary                              Gas Chromatography (OTC-GC) columns.  Our                                       group was the first to successfully detect diffracted                           electrons by a phosphor screen coupled to a                                     photodiode array.  Our procedures are unique in the                             use of multichannel detection to obtain direct real-                            time structural information on molecules in the vapor                           phase.  Later, we identified improvements in design                             that extend serviceability of GED to the study of                               analytes leaving the column of a gas chromatograph.                             GED affords a universal detector with relatively                                uniform sensitivity for diverse molecular species.  The                         most singular feature is that it yields information on                          the structural makeup of those species.  By combining                           the two techniques, GC and GED, we have pioneered                               a new area of structural chromatography.  We now                                propose detector enhancements aimed at extending                                the applicability of this new method from the current                           nanoliter requirement of sample size to the picoliter                           domain, which would enable investigations with OTC-                             GC.  This tool may find considerable importance,                                potentially as a standard instrument for analytical                             applications.  In addition, the detector enhancements                           will pay secondary benefits in other ongoing                                    experiments:  in determining the structures of                                  transient species and in kinetic studies with time                              resolution in the nanosecond regime using real-time                             electron diffraction with pulsed electron beams.",
