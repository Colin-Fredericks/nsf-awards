 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental problems in distributed and parallel computation will          be investigated from both a theoretical and practical standpoint.  A            focal point of the research will be the study of the sequence                   transmission problem.  The sequence transmission problem is the                 problem of transmitting an arbitrarily long sequence of messages from           one party to another over a channel which both reorder and lose                 packets.  This problem is an abstraction of the classic problem of              designing an end-to-end transport layer protocol in the OSI model of a          computer network.  There is a series of new theoretical results, both           upper and lower bounds, which raise the possibility of a new class of           efficient protocols for this problem.  This project will investigate            this new class of protocols by analytically and experimentally                  exploring which variations have the best chance of practical                    implementations.  Those with the most promise will be implemented               under Unix using IP in a controlled experimental environment.                   Experiments will be undertaken on the INTERNET, but only after the              protocols have been thoroughly verified.  In addition to the sequence           transmission problem, several other distributed and parallel computing          problems will be studied.",
