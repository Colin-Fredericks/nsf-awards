 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigations of cell recognition in free-living protozoa have,                in the past, been limited mainly to mating type recognition in                  ciliates.  One other example that has been partially investigated               is the predator-prey relationship between suctorians and their                  prey.  Prey are selected by recognition of surface antigens                     displayed on the prey's cilia.  During proveious work, monoclonal               antibodies specific for ciliary antigens of the prey, Tetrahymena,              were generated and localized on the prey.  The proposed work will               utilize these monoclonal antibodies and identify which antigens are             responsible for recognition.  Inhibition of recognition (and                    therefore feeding) will be assayed by selectively masking the                   prey's surface antigens with monoclonal antibodies.  In order to                characterize the predator's surface receptor that selects prey,                 monoclonal antibodies directed against the suctorian will be used               to block receptors in a set of assays of feeding inhibition that                are complementary to the assays mentioned above.  Binding of all                monoclonal antibodies that are important in recognition/receptor                function will be localized at the light and electron microscope                 levels with labeled secondary antibody.  The ciliated larva of the              suctorian, which is not recognized as prey, also will be probed                 with monoclonal antibodies and lectins to determine its similarity              to the adult suctorian and to prey.                                                                                                                             Suctorians are tentacle-bearing protozoa that feed upon other free-             living, ciliated protozoa.  Some microorganisms that swim against               the tentacles of the suctorian are not captured and remain                      unharmed, while other ciliated protozoa are immediately captured,               immobilized, and ingested.  A variety of evidence suggests that                 receptors for prey are located on the tentacle and that these                   receptors recognize only certain components of the ciliary membrane             of the prey.  The goals of the proposed research are to understand              the specificity of the receptors on the suctorian tentacle involved             in recognizing prey vs non-prey, and to identify the proteins of                the prey's ciliary membrane that are recognized. The results of                 this research will contribute to a new understanding of recognition             phenomena in protozoa.",
