A wide-scale biogeographic                     pattern has been documented which a sexual house gecko,                         Hermidactylus frenatus, (Hf) upon introduction to islands in the                                                                                                                                                                                Pacific, replaces at least three other species as the common                    urban gecko.  Two of the three species (H. garnotti (g) and                     Lepidodactylus lugubris (L1) reproduce parthenogenetically.  In                                                                                                 addition, the coral atoll of Takapoto (in the Tuomotus) is an                   ideal study site for a competitive displacement of  undescribed                                                                                                 sexual Lepidodactylus species by the parthenogen L. lugubris.                   Experimental results to date verify the competitive displacement                                                                                                                                                                                of LI by Hf and suggest possible mechanisms involved.
