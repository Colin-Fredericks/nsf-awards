 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research effort is focused on a computer system for                   automatic generation of feedrates for improving the efficiency of               Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machining.  Reliability is                also improved by in-process adjustment of the feedrates to handle               material property and cutter geometry changes.  The goals are to                be accomplished through:  (1) integration of geometric and                      mechanistic end milling models for volume calculations and                      automatic selection of feedrate for milling sculptured surfaces;                (2) in-process adjustment of the programmed feedrate by comparing               the actual cutting force (power) to the predicted force (power).                A program to automatically select the feedrates for complex                     sculptured end milling cuts is to be developed from experimentally              verified mechanistic and geometric models of the end milling                    process.  The program will be experimentally tested using                       Numerically Controlled (NC) programs supplied to the research team              by an industrial partner.  The programs are used for machining                  stamping dies for complex sculptured surfaces.  The results in                  terms of cutting time, tolerances, and surface finish will be                   compared to industry results, where feeds and speeds are set                    manually.  On-line adjustment capability of the programed feedrates             will be added to the University of New Hampshire CNC machine to                 provide a method to adapt the feedrates to different workpiece                  materials and cutter wear.                                                           This project should lead to four advances in the state-of-the-             art: (1) an improved mechanistic model of the end milling process;              (2) integration of mechanistic and geometric models into one                    system; (3) method to calculate the necessary end milling cutting               feedrates based on geometric tolerance information; (4) an                      experimentally proven on-line feedrate adjustment method.",
