Rozhdestvensky All-Union                                  Optical Society of the USSR, the 1991 International                             Conference on Education in Optics in Leningrad,                                 USSR, 28 September - 1 October 1991.                                                                                                                            The purpose of this conference is to bring optics                               educators from around the world together in the                                 Soviet Union to share education and training                                    methods in modern optics.  The conference intends                               to establish an on-going forum for the sharing of                               international and inter-cultural teaching and learning                          mechanics and philosophies.  The project is proposed                            over a 16-month period beginning November 1990                                  with its organization and public promotion to its end                           in February 1992 at the publication and distribution                            of the conference Proceedings approximately 5                                   months after the conference.  The technical program                             is organized by academic representatives of                                     international university optics programs and is                                 structured around 19 invited talks by highly respected                          optics educators.  Contributed papers are presently                             being solicited to supplement the invited program.                              An exhibit of IBM- and Macintosh-compatible                                     software and displays by university optics programs                             will complement the technical agenda.  The intent of                            this conference is to further serve the optics                                  community to which SPIE, the OSA, and the ICO are                               dedicated.  The recent changes in world politics                                present a unique opportunity on all sides to exchange                           information, to teach and learn, and to further the                             cause of this branch of science to the benefit of all                           nations.",
