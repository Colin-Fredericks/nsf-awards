 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to investigate the basic                        hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics of black hole systems.                   The research approach is numerical; the black hole physics is                   modeled using large-scale, multidimensional finite-                             differencing.  A three-dimensional, general relativistic code                   will be used to investigate the nonlinear behavior of                           nonaxisymmetric disk instabilities in pressure-supported                        accretion tori.  This research will be extended to studies of                   three-dimensional accretion flows, to the transport of angular                  momentum through disks by nonaxisymmetric hydrodynamic waves,                   and to effects due to frame dragging by Kerr holes.  Black                      hole accretion systems also produce outflows in the form of                     highly collimated jets.  Magnetohydrodynamic jet collimation                    processes will be studied with a two-dimensional Newtonian                      code.  The jet systems SS433 and Sc0 X-1 will be modeled with                   this code to determine whether magnetic forces can account for                  the observed jet focusing.  In addition, work will continue on                  a fully-relativistic computer program, which will be applied                    to increasingly complex problems involving jet collimation,                     focusing, and generation, as well as to the extraction of                       energy from rotating black holes.",
