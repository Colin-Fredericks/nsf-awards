 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in cellular                      biochemistry between Dr. Lawrence Winship, Hampshire                            College and Dr. Kerstin Huss-Danell, Department of Plant                        Physiology, University of Umea, Sweden.  The objective of                       the proposed research is to examine hydrogen evolution by                       actinorhizal root nodules.                                                                                                                                      Nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) by actinorhizal                         root nodules is sensitive to changes in temperature, oxygen                     concentration and photosynthate supply. Each of these                           parameters alters the balance between oxygen diffusion into                     and consumption by nodules.  A mechanism to protect                             nitrogenase from inactivation by excess oxygen as the                           environment changes must exist, so that the supply of fixed                     nitrogen to the plant can continue.  Adaptive mechanisms                        include a variable nodule diffusion barrier and conforma-                       tional protection of nitrogenase.  The investigators will                       use a unique HUP- alder symbiosis and a continuous-flow,                        open gas exchange system to follow in vivo nitrogenase                          activity and respiration. The environmental variables to be                     tested include oxygen concentration and temperature;                            measurements will include estimations of nodule gas diffusion                   properties, assays of nitrogenase in vitro, and immunoassays                    of the levels of the protein components of the nitrogenase                      systems. The project will benefit from the mutual expertise                     of the two investigators:  Dr. Winship has extensive                            experience in conducting measurements of environmental                          effects on nitrogenase activity in intact plants, while Dr.                     Huss-Danell is well known for her studies on the physio-                        logical factors that affect reduction in root nodules. The                      results of this research will contribute to the understanding                   of the physiology of nitrogen-fixing actinorhizal plants.",
