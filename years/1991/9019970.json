 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to understand the details of the way solar energy is                   transferred to and within the earth's atmosphere it is essential                to have a good understanding of the fundamental properties of the               various states of the atoms and molecules that exist at each                    level of the atmosphere. It is also important to develop means                  to accurately calibrate the instruments that measure the                        energetics directly in the atmosphere. This program combines                    laboratory measurements with advanced models of atomic and                      molecular species to provide basic data to advance research in                  upper atmospheric processes.  Detailed models will be used to                   simulate the excited night or day upper atmosphere, with                        particular attention paid to the energy budget. Concurrently,                   laboratory measurements of the light emitted in a crossed beam                  collision processes will provide calibrated  spectra over a large               wavelength region to provide a primary reference data set for the               simulations. Electron impact studies of the species N2, 02, NI,                 OI, HI, NO and ArI will be performed, and energy dependent                      collision strengths will be obtained through model analysis to                  allow the construction of collision models capable of producing                 results for a broad range of relevant conditions.  H2 emission                  will be studied because it can provide accurate calibration of                  spaceflight and laboratory instrumentation. Also included will                  be the determination of dissociation and predissociation yields,                absolute transition probability tables, and high resolution                     absorption properties for selected species.",
