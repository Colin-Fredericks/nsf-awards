 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, the University of New                 Mexico's Maxwell Museum will purchase an ARGUS computer system                  and use it to manage their large and valuable anthropological                   collections.  The ARGUS system includes a relational data base                  which will allow artifacts to be catalogued, described and                      retrieved in different combinations according to required                       criteria.  It will also be used to record registration and loan                 data.  The result will be improved management of the collections                and increased ease of use for researchers.                                                                                                                      The collections of the Maxwell Museum consist of approximately                  15,000 individually catalogued and 7,500 cubic feet of box stored               archaeological materials, 30,000 individually catalogued                        ethnological objects as well as large numbers of photos, slides,                paintings and other materials.  Not surprisingly, they focus on                 the Southwestern United States.  The archaeological materials                   span the period from Paleoindian through contact times  and are                 particularly strong in documenting late Puebloan and contact                    period occupation from about 1250-1700 A.D.  The ethnographic                   materials include extensive series of kachinas as well as sand                  paintings and constitute a particularly valuable resource for                   students of native American cultures.  The Maxwell Museum was one               of the first in the United States to automate its collection                    management and the original SELGEM system is both inadequate and                out of date.  As a result, it is difficult to find and track                    materials and to meet researchers' specific needs.  Installation                of ARGUS will remedy this situation.                                                                                                                            This project is important because it will help the Maxwell Museum               curate its large and irreplaceable collections.  It will increase               access not only to scientists but to the general public.",
