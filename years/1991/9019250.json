 "awd_abstract_narration": "A specific DNA structure, the Holliday junction, is an                          intermediate in all recombination and may repair processes in                   the cell.  Experimental evidence has been accumulating which                    indicates that the structure of the Holliday junction is                        sensitive to the DNA sequence at the branch points and that                     this has important biological consequences.  In this project                    Dr. Chazin proposes to examine the physical structure and                       biological properties of synthetic immobile Holliday junctions                  by using an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach involving                   molecular biology, time resolved fluorescence and NMR                           spectroscopy, and molecular modeling/computer graphics.  Time                   resolved fluorescence will be used to gain information on the                   global structure of the junctions, using fluorescence energy                    transfer experiments to determine the relative distances                        between the four arms of the junctions.  NMR spectroscopy will                  provide detailed information on the local structure.  A                         comparative analysis of the internal dynamics of these                          junctions will be made by fluorescence depolarization and NMR                   measurements.  These data taken together will be used to solve                  the three-dimensional structures in solution of a series of                     related Holliday junctions and thereby determine how the                        sequence determines the geometry of the junction.  These                        systematic studies will provide critical insights into                          formation of Holliday junctions, their propagation along the                    DNA duplexes, and the subsequent steps of junction recognition                  and resolution.",
