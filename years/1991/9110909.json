 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interdisciplinary research program in the area of intelligent                materials systems and adaptive structures will be developed, with               the primary focus being the development of the fundamental science              base necessary for the implementation of this technology in U.S.                applications.  During the initial program period,                               electrorheological (ER) materials and their usage in applications               will be studied.  Theoretical efforts in the areas of ER material               rheology, ER material pre-yield adaptive structures, and ER                     material post-yield adaptive devices will be performed.  All                    initial efforts will be extensions of research by the present                   investigator while the previously employed at Lord Corporation.                 Further development of a microscopic model of ER material behavior              will be completed, and the rheological response of state-of-the-art             ER formulations will be simulated.  Knowledge of pre-yield behavior             will be utilized in a study of ER material adaptive structures,                 during which a structural response theory will be further                       developed.  Rheological information related to post-yield response              will be coupled to the development of an improved theory for ER                 material controllable device performance.  The overall impact of                the investigation will be possible, the improvement of the                      fundamental theoretical understanding of ER materials and their                 usage in applications.",
