 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a twelve month long-term visit by                       Professor Larry J. Miller, Department of Biology, Gannon                        University, Erie, Pennsylvania, to Japan for a cooperative                      research project with Professors Tsuneo Moriya and Yoko                         Miyashita, Department of Biology, Sapporo Medical College.                      The researchers plan to undertake immunocytochemical                            investigations of AVT and CRF immunoreactive perikarya and                      fibers in the brain of juvenile salmon and to correlate                         changes in AVAT and CRF immunoreactivity with physiological                     markers indicative of seawater readiness.  The research will                    be carried out on the Chum salmon which is an important                         commercial species in Japan.  Professors Moriya and Miyashita                   have an established research program using Chum salmon.  The                    researchers will be looking at the timing of the salmon's                       migratory phase, the environmental and hormonal control of                      migration and the control of certain accompanying physiological                 changes such as effects on skin pigmentation.                                                                                                                   The research results should provide answers to important                        biological questions fundamental to an understanding of                         salmonid physiology which are of real significance to                           salmonid aquaculture.  The Sapporo Medical Laboratory is well                   equipped for the experiments.  They stock salmon in both                        fresh and salt water and have also devised a circular tank to                   create simulating current flow.  Because Chum salomn are                        unique in that they mature to smolt phase within three months                   of hatching it allows enough time for all the planned                           experiments to be completed during Professor Miller's visit                     to the Sapporo Laboratory.  All of the researchers are                          anxiously looking forward to this project and it is believed                    that this is the beginning of a collaboration that will                         continue past this formal agreement.",
