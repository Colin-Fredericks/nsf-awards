 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research award will support the linguistic and                ethnographic research of a cultural anthropologist on the Navajo                Indian reservation.  The project will investigate the                           significance of a linguistic term denoting the abstract creation                principle of \"non-constancy\" as well as \"Navajo mythological                    figures\", and \"berdache\" (meaning Native Americans who adopt the                behavior, dress, and/or sexual preferences of the opposite sex).                Methods will include linguistic and ethnographic interviews with                medicine people as well as people identified by the term                        (\"nadleeh\"), and archival research.                                                                                                                             This research will add to our knowledge of \"berdache\", and                      important element of Native American culture that has been                      clearly understood.  In addition knowledge of the community                     understanding and values on these issues can help regional health               specialists to understand Native American sexual behavior, which                can help develop culturally relevant AIDS prevention strategies.",
