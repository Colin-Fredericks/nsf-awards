 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports a program of airborne Doppler-radar                    measurements to study the atmospheric sensible heat and momentum                budgets in the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Program's Coupled               Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE).  The primary                 objective of the research is to obtain better estimates of the                  magnitudes and vertical profiles of all the terms in the                        atmospheric sensible heat budget in convectively disturbed                      regions over the western Pacific warm pool.  To achieve this                    objective, the PIs will take advantage of the fact that the two                 NOAA P3 aircraft and the NCAR Electra aircraft will be                          instrumented to obtain dual-doppler radar measurements by means                 of dual-beam antennas.  The aircraft will also be equipped with                 boundary-layer instruments, cloud microphysical sensors, and                    radiometers.  The PI will use the three aircraft, in conjunction                with a ship/island network of sounding systems and surface-based                radars, to obtain key information for calculating the terms in                  the heat and momentum budgets.  Terms associated with the                       synopticscale flow can be estimated from the sounding-system                    data. Radiation measurements aboard the aircraft will be used to                estimate the terms associated with radiative transfer in and out                of cloud.  Precipitation and boundary-layer measurements made                   both by the aircraft and by the surface network will provide                    important constraints and boundary conditions for the                           calculations.  The airborne dual-Doppler radar data will provide                key information for calculating the terms in the budgets                        associated with in-cloud air motions.                                                This research is important because it has the potential to                 increase understanding of how convection and clouds influence                   climate on interannual time scales.  This project is part of the                interagency TOGA COARE program.",
