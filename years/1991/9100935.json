Nowak of the Physics Institute of                         the Polish Academy of Sciences is to study the tautomerism                      process in nucleic acid bases and their derivatives that                        occur spontaneously or are invoked by UV radiation.  The                        researchers intend to continue developing ab-initio                             quantum chemical techniques for more accurate calculations                      of electronic structures and of excited electronic                              states.  Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and                               coupled-cluster methods will be extended to study                               electron excitation processes and develop optimization                          techniques for correlation orbitals based on the                                Hylleraas functional.  The results are expected to                              develop theoretical methodologies that will be combined                         with experimental approaches of matrix isolation                                spectroscopy and extend understanding of the IR spectra                         of a group of molecules in the gas-phase, as well as to                         describe the mechanism of the interaction and chemical                          transformation of these molecules upon UV radiation.                                                                                                            This project in theoretical chemistry fulfills the                              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                          enabling leading experts in the United States and                               Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                        research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                           and competence.",
