 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV),                  was established in 1970 by the International Union of                           Microbiological Societies (IUMS), to provide a unified taxonomic                scheme for the confusing virus classification and nomenclature                  situation existing among the subdisciplines of virology. The Code               and Data Subcommittee of ICTV has made substantial progress                     towards the development of a universal code for the description                 of virus characters but, because of some disparity among                        subgroups of virologists and changing technology, this work                     requires major revision and updating.  The absence of a widely                  recognized set of standardized terms for characterizing all types               of viruses has resulted in duplication of effort by groups                      outside the ICTV. These efforts to classify characteristics of                  plant, insect, microbial, and vertebrate viruses show striking                  similarity in content, although the precise terminology is far                  from standard. The Code and Data Subcommittee has taken the first               steps toward unification of these various schemes through a                     survey of existing virus databases and by attendance at a                       National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored \"Workshop on                        Standardized Terminology of Virus Characteristics.\"  It was the                 consensus of participants at this Workshop that the availability                of standard descriptors would provide a \"software independent\"                  tool to facilitate database development and data exchange among                 virologists.  This proposal to the NSF requests funding for                     generation and dissemination of this standardized terminology                   under the direction of the ICTV Code and Data Subcommittee.  It                 is anticipated that this data set will be the foundation of a                   World Virus Database, the purpose of which would be to provide a                standard international reference tool for editors, publishers,                  database developers, and the research community.",
