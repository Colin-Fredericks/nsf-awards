 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, scholars have begun to explore how notions about               gender have shaped the priorities, methods, and subject matter of               science.  While historians of science have studied many aspects of              gender influences on science, there remains large areas that need               to be explored if we are to understand the pervasiveness of these               influences.  Dr. Schiebinger is examining gender influences on what             might be called the very skeleton of biological sciences--that is,              its classification system.  The studies of species, their                       relationships to each other and their evolution are dependent upon              and reflected in the classification system.  Dr. Schiebinger is                 examining how gender influenced the formative stages of natural                 historical classification.  She argues that notions of gender lay               at the heart of 18th century revolutions in views of nature.  This              interdisciplinary and historical study divides into three parts,                dealing separately with the vegetable, animal and mineral kingdoms.             Topics to be explored include:  the social and political                        circumstances surrounding the sexualization of plants (a key event              in the revolution in 18th century botanical taxonomy); the question             of why (considering the alternatives) mammals are called mammals-               -a term which in the 1750's supplanted the term quadruped that had              been used since Aristotle; an analysis of the first scientific                  representations of primates; and a study of attempts to classify                humans by race and by sex, a topic only recently of interest to                 historians of science.  These developments are being considered in              a context of broader social trends affecting the development of                 science.",
