 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-week summer workshop at the University of New Hampshire              targets undergraduate mathematics faculty who teach linear algebra              or differential equations, but have minimal experience with                     computer-aided instruction (CAI) in their courses.  These faculty               seek to enhance their teaching by creating CAI materials, e.g. in-              class demonstrations, problem sets, syllabi, and operational                    procedures, that effectively integrate computer technology into                 their instructional plans.  Morning sessions survey and reinforce               specific mathematical concepts, address the development of                      pedagogical strategies, and examine the design of curriculum                    materials.  Each afternoon, participants work in teams to                       formulate, produce, and evaluate CAI materials appropriate to their             individual courses.  Guest visitors supplement these regular                    activities with talks and discussions on applications and broad                 pedagogical issues raised by CAI.  The major impact of the program              is the enhancement of the teaching of differential equations and                linear algebra.  Effective use of CAI in these subjects can                     increase the mathematical maturity of students without sacrificing              course content.  This objective is also with curricular goals in                engineering and the physical science.",
