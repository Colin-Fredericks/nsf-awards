 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although Doppler weather radar systems have been used as research               tools for many years, they are just moving into operational use with            the multi-agency federal program called NEXRAD (Next Generation                 Weather Radar).  Each of the 175 radars in the NEXRAD network will be           collecting data at the rate of several megabytes per minute.  Such              large amounts of complex atmospheric data cannot be assimilated                 without computerized analysis to reduce the data and make it more               comprehensible to the meteorologist.                                                                                                                            This project will utilize visualization techniques to enhance the               meteorologist's comprehension of the BVP kinematic analysis and its             relationship to the three-dimensional reflectivity structure.  A                system will be built by combining scientific visualization techniques           and single Doppler kinematic analysis procedures for banded                     precipitation structures.  The ultimate goal of the project is to               produce a model visualization environment to serve as a powerful tool           for atmospheric scientists studying the physics and dynamics of                 precipitation systems.",
