 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to describe a new vision of programming, as                  part of an effort to define and refine the idea of technological                fluency as a source of learning power.  Our Constructionist                     theory leads us to view technological knowledge as \"reflexive,\"                 valuable not only in its own right, but also capable of enhancing               the learning of many other things.  In the past, th focus has                   been on programming as the most accessible form of such                         reflexive knowledge.  Now new ideas and new advanced computers                  make possible a dramatic extension of this role of technological                fluency.  Programming continues to provide a natural entry route,               but in this new context a new sense of what programming                         means.                                                                                                                                                          As a means of developing and studying this extended notion of                   programming, three complementary activities are in proposed.  In                the \"Pogramming Paradigms\" activity, the focus is on transferring               new computational frameworks, most notably multiprocessing, into                education.  In the Robotics activity, the classical construction                kit to include new computational elements.  In the \"Software                    Design\" activity, the learning that takes place when                            children develop complete, multimedia software \"products,\"                      designed for use by others will be explored.  Each of these three               activities involves technology development.  But in each case,                  the main focus is on conceptual development and new educational                 issues and strategies.  In  each activity, the appropriability of               its technologies and its ideas in close interaction with schools                and particularly with communities that have traditionally been                  undeserved or intellectually disenfranchised will be studied.",
