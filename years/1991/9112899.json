The                  technical sessions will include the  following topics: Fracture                 Mechanics; Fatigue and Fracture of Steel; Fatigue  and Fracture                 of Concrete; Crack Growth; Fatigue Behavior   and Testing of                    Joints; Fatigue Behavior and Testing of                                         Structural Members; Condition Monitoring and Damage                             Assessment; Life Prediction; Design; and Reliability.  The                      organizing secretary is Dr. A.G. Madhava Rao of the                             Structural Engineering Research Centre (SERC), in Madras,                       India.  Proceedings including the presented papers and                          poster papers is expected to be published.                                                                                                                      Scope:  This is the first international meeting in the area   of                fatigue and fracture in steel and concrete structures to   be                   held in India, and is attracting wide response from many                        countries.  There are over 110 papers already submitted for                     presentation.  The SERC is India's best known research                          institute in the field.  It has excellent facilities for                        research and for the meeting arrangement.  The proposed                         U.S. participants are  eminent scholars in the field.  They                     are likely to contribute well to the symposium and to gain                      from their participation.  It is also likely that future   joint                projects will be identified.  This project fits the   objectives                of the US-India Program.",
