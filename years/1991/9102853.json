 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the components of a numerical program that have the greatest              influence on accuracy are what can be called numerical control                  structures: convergence tests, stopping criteria, deflation criteria,           and identification of problem instances that require special                    treatment.  In order to guarantee high accuracy in computations with            large matrices these control structures must be algebraically sound             and perform well in finite precision arithmetic.                                                                                                                This project will exploit the structure and geometry of a problem for           the purpose of designing numerical control structures.  The structure           of the singular value decomposition will be used to determine the               directions of errors and develop a perturbation theory; and the                 geometry of subspaces and angles between them will be used to design            numerical control structures.                                                                                                                                   The resulting perturbation theory and control structures are expected           to lead to highly accurate implementations for the computation of               eigenvectors of symmetric matrices and singular vectors by inverse              iteration, for the computation of singular values by the (extended)             Golub-Reinsch algorithm, and for the computation of eigenvalues by the          QL algorithm.                                                                                                                                                   By design, the numerical control structures of the (extended) Golub-            Reinsch algorithm are invariant under column scaling.  Since recent             error bounds for linear system solution, singular value                         decompositions, and eigendecompositions exhibit the same invariance,            the numerical control structures will be employed to explain the                significance and particular form of these error bounds.  The goal is            to produce more realistic assessments of problem conditioning and               algorithm stability, which is especially important for highly accurate          solution of large problems.",
