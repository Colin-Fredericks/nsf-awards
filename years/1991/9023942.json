 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the project is to provide the first rigorous                     empirical analysis of the impact of unionization on firm                        bankruptcy, liquidation and unemployment due to plant closings. A               consistent empirical finding is that unions raise wages above those             found in nonunion firms and that in a competitive product market                one would expect to find that  unionized firms would go out of                  business more than nonunion firms. However, if unions engage in                 economic rent sharing then during periods of economic hardship                  unionized firms may be able to remain solvent by giving back some               of these rents.                                                                                                                                                 These potential outcomes will be empirically analyzed by first                  examining the extent to which unionized firms become insolvent                  relative to nonunion firms. Second,  the extent to which firms drop             unionized lines of business relative to nonunionized ones will be               determined. Finally, the extent to which unionized plants close and             workers become unemployed relative to nonunionized ones will be                 investigated. Data from COMPUSTAT, Census of Manufactures data on               plant closings, the Current Population Survey, as well as new                   survey data developed from these companies will be used.                                                                                                        The project will make an important contribution in two areas of                 economics - labor economics and industrial organization. The                    results will improve our understanding of firm shutdowns, the role              of unions on firm performance and how these are related to varying              levels of profit, employment and industrial structure.",
