 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research projects to be undertaken are in the following                two areas of algebraic topology: the stable homotopy groups of                  spheres, and the homotopy limit problem.  In the first problem,                 the investigator will study certain third-order periodic                        phenomena in the stable homotopy groups of spheres.  This is a                  continuation of a general program for studying the global                       behavior of stable homotopy groups of spheres, as formulated by                 Miller, Revenel and Wilson.  Results obtained from this research                will enhance our understanding of the underlying periodicity of                 stable homotopy.  In the second problem, the author will study                  the so called \"homotopy limit problem.\"  The importance of this                 problem lies in the fact that various well-known conjectures and                theorems can be formulated as particular homotopy limit problems.               One of the goals is to extend known affirmative solutions to the                homotopy limit problem to include other important spaces from                   algebraic K-theory.  The result can them be applied to the study                of important homotopy theoretic questions.                                           Bascially, homotopy theory is a tool for investigating the                 topology of spheres in all dimensions and other such natural                    geometric objects.  It is an algebraic tool, useful because                     algebra permits computation.",
