 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Connecticut State Department of Education will                         carry out a project, funded through a SGER grant, which                         will research the feasibility and validity of using                             interactive video as a means of assessing new teachers'                         knowledge of laboratory safety.  The number of demands and                      requirements placed on teachers regarding safe laboratory                       practice has increased greatly in the last few years.  In                       response to these increased regulations, beginning teachers                     often avoid hands-on laboratory activities due to liability                     concerns and their lack of confidence in their ability to                       carry out the activities safely.  The goal of the project                       is to develop an instrument which can assess whether a                          teacher can recognize unsafe laboratory practice in a real                      laboratory environment and to strengthen areas in which the                     teacher is weak.  The project would be part of a new                            program of assessment of teacher competency for                                 certification which is under development in Connecticut.                                                                                                             The project will carry out research to determine                           whether this interactive mode of assessment provides more                       authentic, valid, and reliable data on teacher competency                       in lab safety than traditional pencil-and-paper                                 instruments.  The interactive video format can capture the                      ambiance of a real laboratory situation with its                                distractions, disturbances, confusion, and multiple                             activities, and the interactive video will be able to                           measure how well the teacher can cope with this environment                     in real time.  The results of this assessment will indicate                     the areas in which a teacher needs additional work, and                         support will be provided so that the teacher will                               ultimately feel knowledgeable, competent, and confident in                      carrying out hands-on laboratory experiences.  A group of                       experienced teachers has participated in identifying the                        most common and significant types of safety violations                          which should be included in the interactive video                               materials.  Teachers will continue to be involved in the                        project in reviewing and field-testing the materials and in                     a mentorship program to support beginning teachers in                           following effective laboratory practices.                                                                                                                            The State of Connecticut's cost-sharing is 2.7 times                       greater than NSF's contribution.",
