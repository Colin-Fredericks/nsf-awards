 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed program consists of two research efforts:  An                      investigation of luminosity changes and magnetic activity in                    solar-type stars; and an investigation of the systematic                        effects of spots in chromospherically active stars.  As                         participants in the former project, an astronomer and an                        engineer and several minority students at Tennessee State                       University will construct and operate a 0.8-m robotic                           telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory near Pasadena,                            California.  The objective is to gain insight into the short                    and long-term behavior of solar activity, especially how the                    magnetism and luminosity of the Sun change over intervals of                    decades to centuries, by studying an ensemble of solar-type                     stars over a much shorter time interval of a few years.                         Additional insight into the evolution of magnetic activity                      and luminosity over the Sun's entire main-sequence lifetime                     may be gained by studying other lower main-sequence stars                       with a variety of masses and ages.  This detailed study of                      magnetic and luminosity variations of stars will have far-                      reaching consequences for an understanding of the physical                      principles of the solar-stellar connection and for assessing                    the uncertainties and true importance of the Sun's potential                    influence in mean global temperature change models, which                       have so far based their predictions of global warming on the                    assumption of a constant Sun.                                                                                                                                   By combining spectra with the photometry, the structure of                      spots (namely whether they consist of a single large dark                       area, as suspected, or several smaller dark areas close                         together) will be determined by another group of astronomers                    and minority students at the university.                                                                                                                        This is made possible by the fact that information about dark                   spots on chromospherically active solar-type stars is poised                    to undergo a revolution as the result of the extensive                          observations now piling up from automatic telescopes.  These                    data will allow many individual spots to be identified and                      studied from their emergence to their demise.  As a result of                   the project and related ones, scientists will finally be able                   to know just how properties of these spots compare with those                   of sunspots, to find how chromospherically active stars                         respond to having 10-30% of their surfaces blocked by dark                      areas, to assess just what effect-if any-magnetic faculae                       have on these stars' luminosities, and to determine whether                     such very active stars really do have cycles of activity like                   the solar cycle.",
