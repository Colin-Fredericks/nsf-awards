 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Guam for the renovation and repair of the                         University of Guam Marine Laboratory which houses marine                        sciences research and research training activities and is the                   only U.S. marine laboratory facility in the region.  This                       building was constructed in 1970 and last renovated in 1975.  The               ARFMP grant of $130,795 will be used to modernize these research                and research training facilities which are located in a harsh and               corrosive tropical marine natural environment that necessitates                 an unusually large amount of maintenance and repair of                          facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                  current research infrastructure by adding and replacing                         laboratory counters, providing a laboratory space for                           photomicrography and microbiology and a capacity for boat                       storage, and eliminating the problems of fluctuations in water                  temperature and salinity and algal fouling of the outside water                 table and aquarium area.                                                                                                                                        This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of undergraduate and master's degree students.                 The Guam Marine Laboratory plays a unique role in the nation's                  scientific base due to its geographical location and the specific               research expertise that it represents.  It provides research                    opportunities for native Pacific Islanders living on the U.S.-                  affiliated islands of Micronesia, and indeed, outside of Hawaii,                which is many thousands of miles away, it is the only facility                  where local people can obtain undergraduate and graduate degree                 experience and conduct research involving the local marine                      environments.",
