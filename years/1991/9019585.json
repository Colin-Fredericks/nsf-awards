 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research planned is to analyze specific representative enzymes              in the daunomycin biosynthetic pathway to determine their substrate             specificity, kinetics, and regulation as part of an assessment of               possible differential regulation of the first one-half of the                   pathway in relation to the second one-half; such differential                   regulation may account for the failure of biosynthetic                          intermediates to be converted to the end-product antibiotic and,                instead, to accumulate in cells.  Molecular biological and genetic              approaches will be employed to determine transcriptional and                    translational regulation of each enzyme in the pathway that has                 been purified, kinetics, etc., determined, so as to enlarge our                 understanding of the physiological and molecular genetic aspects                of the regulation of the synthesis of this antibiotic, a product                of secondary metabolite syntheses.                                                                                                                              Antibiotic synthesis and excretion is a characteristic of many                  bacteria and fungi and is a product of their \"secondary                         metabolism\"; the regulation of this type of metabolism is even less             well understood than is central metabolism, and this project is                 directed at elucidating regulatory aspects of the secondary                     metabolism of a bacterium producing the antibiotic, daunomycin;                 this antibiotic's precursors accumulate in the producing cells                  rather than being converted entirely into the antibiotic;                       understanding what is responsible for this inefficiency may permit              developments to improve the conversion and increase effectiveness               of antibiotic production.",
