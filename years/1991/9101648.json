 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to develop both experimental and analytical               methods to determine internal stresses induced in laminated                     composite structures during processing.  Through these internal                 stress characterizations, a methodology will be developed that                  can provide a basic understanding for controlled processing and                 performance of composites.  Both thermosetting and thermoplastic                polymer matrices reinforced with continuous fibers, that are                    potential candidates for structural materials in the electric                   power industry, will be examined using well established as well                 as novel lamination processes.  As an integral part of this                     study, several process monitoring techniques will be evaluated;                 these techniques could also be used for on-line, long term                      durability monitoring.  Internal stress analysis will be studied                on macroscopic as well as microscopic (micro-mechanical) scale                  considering both time dependent (kinetic) and time independent                  (thermodynamic) effects.  Through the experimental and analytical               approach, an attempt will be made to characterize composite                     system molecular and morphological structural features that are                 influenced and/or give rise to the internal stresses developed                  during processing, leading to full property characterization.                        It is anticipated that the results derived from this study,                in conjunction with previous developments, will provide a basic                 methodology for process analysis of laminated composites that may               also provide fundamental information in screening new materials                 and processes for load bearing structural application of                        composites in real manufacturing operations focused on the needs                of the electric power industry.",
