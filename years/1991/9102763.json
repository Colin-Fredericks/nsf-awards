 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted to investigate mixed mode fracture                   mechanisms of a unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite material                  using the modified Iosipescu test technique.  Intralaminar fracture             mechanisms in the composite will be analyzed numerically and                    experimentally.  The research will use finite element methods                   extensively to study the mixed mode stress intensity factors and                the energy release rates associated with intralaminar cracks in the             composite Iosipescu specimens tested under biaxial stress                       conditions.  In addition, adhesively bonded composite systems will              be tested under mixed mode loading conditions using the newly                   designed Iosipescu fixture.  Linear and non-linear finite element               calculations of the adhesive joints in the Iosipescu specimens will             be performed.                                                                                                                                                   The fundamental significance of this research is that it will                   contribute to the understanding of intralaminar fracture mechanisms             in carbon fibre/epoxy composites caused by biaxial stress                       conditions.  Moreover, the study will provide new insights into the             complex failure phenomena of advanced adhesive joint systems.  The              practical significance is that after comprehensive numerical and                experimental investigations of the newly designed biaxial test                  technique, the test will have great potential to become standard                for mixed mode failure and fracture analysis of many advanced                   composite systems.",
