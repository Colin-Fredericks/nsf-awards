 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Reed                College for the replacement of the Chemistry Building which houses              the research and research training activities of the Chemistry                  Department.  This building was constructed during World War II and              has not been renovated since that time.  Its replacement is fully               justified and cost-effective.  The ARFMP grant of $816,000 and                  $1,149,525 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to              modernize these research and research training facilities.  This                project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure by providing support for that portion of the                     construction of an upgraded space which represents replacement of               the old facility, complete with the installation of adequate                    electrical and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)                systems and fume hoods.                                                                                                                                         This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate students in a liberal                 arts college well known for the high percentage of its graduates                who go on to receive doctoral degrees in the sciences.",
