 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is collaborative with J. George Shanthikumar of               University of California at Berkeley.  The principal investigator's             developed the notions of strong stochastic convexity and                        directional convexity, which are sample- path based structural                  properties essential to the analysis and optimal design of                      stochastic discrete event systems in general and queueing networks              in particular.  This project focuses on properties relating to                  structural and policy changes in queueing networks.  To model and               understand these changes, notions of monotonicity and convexity do              not apply directly.  New concepts and new machineries along the                 lines of stochastic rearrangement and stochastic majorization will              be developed.  These notions provide mathematical support for                   \"pairwise interchange\" arguments that are widely used in                        scheduling, control, and resource allocation.  Preliminary studies              have demonstrated their usefulness and effectiveness in dealing                 with structural and policy changes.  Furthermore, these properties              are natural extensions of stochastic convexity.                                      A new, unified hierarchy of (sample-path based) second-order               properties in queueing networks appears to be now emerging.                     Together, these properties will support the (static) parametric                 design of queueing networks, and dynamic scheduling and control.",
