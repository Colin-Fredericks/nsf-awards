 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long term goal is to develop a quantitative understanding                of mechanical-to-electrical transduction in the somatosensory                   system.  The model system proposed for this research proposal is                the receptor Pacinian corpuscle, mainly because it is the most                  extensively studied skin receptor.  The Pacinian corpuscle is an                encapsulated nerve ending in the skin and other tissues.  In a                  previous study a capsule model for the transmission of strain to                the receptor membrane was developed.  The aims of the proposed                  research are to:  (i) extend the capsule model to make it more                  anatomically realistic; (ii) develop a receptor membrane model                  involving a transduction current model of a strain-sensitive                    conductance, which accounts for the known cytoplasmic extensions,               and which is coupled to the capsule model through a strain                      variable;  (iii) initiate development of a model for the skin                   with receptors;  (iv) examine solution behavior analytically of                 the generalized cable model developed for the receptor's                        membrane.  The research is in collaboration with M.H. Holmes, an                expert in biomechanical modeling, and S. Bolanowski, Jr., a                     leading experimentalist in Pacinian corpuscles.  Aspects of the                 research should be useful in analyzing other mechanoreceptors.                       The sense-of-touch, or tactile, system is not well                         understood in comparison to the vision and auditory systems, and                that lack of knowledge hinders the development of artificial                    sense-of-touch systems that can be immensely useful in developing               prosthetic devises for the old and handicapped young, as well as                more obvious uses in robotics.  A meaningful part of this is to                 understand how various skin receptors work.  Information                        extracted out of studies of receptors will be used in an                        integrated model of the tactile system to be developed in future                studies.  Another goal in developing quantitative models of                     various aspects of the sense-of-touch system is to test various                 hypotheses about tactile processing that cannot be obtained                     experimentally.  The modeling approach should suggest new                       physiological experiments to try.",
