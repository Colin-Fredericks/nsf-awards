 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is the development of new miniature                    radio frequency coils that will extend the application of NMR                   microscopy to smaller fields of view than have previously been                  studied.  We propose to develop new coils with diameters as small               as 10 um, which would be two orders of magnitude smaller than                   those presently used.  At these dimensions, traditional circuit                 models used to characterize the interaction between the coil and                the sample are inadequate.  Therefore, we propose to conduct a                  more complete theoretical analysis and experimental validation of               coil performance.  This evaluation will include 1) design and                   fabrication of new coil configurations, 2) electrical                           characterization of coil parameters (resistance, inductance,                    quality factor), and 3) verification of coil performance (signal-               to-noise, image resolution) at 300 MHz.  The results of this                    study will be new microdomain coils with enhanced sensitivity for               small imaging volumes and improved signal-to-noise.",
