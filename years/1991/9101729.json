 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to develop a new method for the fabrication               of plastic optical fibers that is applicable to various polymers                including the ones which cannot be made into optical fibers by                  the conventional methods despite their excellent optical                        properties.  The new method is, in a sense, a modified                          coextrusion process in which a thermoplastic material is spun                   into a hollow fiber forming a cladding while another material is                fed into the core at the same time.  In this process only the                   cladding material has to be thermoplastic and the core material                 can be any class of materials; a liquid, an elastomeric gel, or a               thermoplastic.  After the spinning, the core material may be                    polymerized or cross-linked to enhance the mechanical strength of               the optical fiber.  To assess the effectiveness and the                         applicability of the technique, a liquid monomer and a cross-                   linkable elastomer are used as the core of the optical fibers.                  The core materials are polymerized/cross-linked after the                       spinning process, and the quality of the optical fibers are                     evaluated.                                                                           The most significant feature of the new technique is its                   broad applicability to numerous materials, thus opening the way                 to explore a variety of core material options for plastic optical               fibers which could not be considered before by the conventional                 methods.",
