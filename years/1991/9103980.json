 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much attention has been given to human activities in                       tropical regions during the past half century.  Tropical dry                    forests occupy a roughly equivalent proportion of the earth's                   surface as do tropical rain forests, and like the tropical rain                 forests, they are decreasing dramatically in area.  Shifting                    cultivation, the principal subsistence agricultural activity in                 tropical forests, has been less well studied in tropical dry                    forests than it has been in the tropical rain forests.  This                    doctoral dissertation project will investigate the shifting                     cultivation system as it operates in diverse environmental                      settings within the tropical dry forests of Guerrero, Mexico.                   Specific attention will be given to cultigen diversity, fallow                  characteristics, environmental impacts, and the sustainability of               the production strategies.  Field research will include                         observation of cultivation activities and biophysical conditions                and processes.  Quantitative assessment of changes in the                       cultivation system in recent decades also will be used provide a                basis for testing hypotheses about the form, timing, and location               of shifting cultivation.                                                                                                                                             This project will generate valuable information about                      tropical dry forest ecosystems that have been affected by the                   practice of agriculture.  The information will contribute to                    fundamental understanding of the relationships between                          environmental, cultural, and economic conditions.  The project                  will provide information relevant to addressing some of the major               problems associated with agriculture encountered by developing                  countries.  It also will provide an excellent opportunity for a                 promising young scholar to continue to develop independent                      research skills.",
