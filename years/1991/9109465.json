 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore the basis for the subjective                         experiences associated with memory, question answering, and                     evaluation.  The research is guided by a model in which such                    experiences depend on an inference about the ease with which                    ideas come to mind.                                                                                                                                             One set of experiments will investigate whether the experience of               remembering is based on the ease with which ideas come to mind                  during recall attempts.  The particular ideas that come to mind                 during recall will be manipulated independently of the actual to-               be-remembered events, thereby creating memory illusions.  Other                 experiments will investigate whether the experience of confidence               in answers to world knowledge questions and the evaluation of the               difficulty of questions is based on the ease with which answers                 come to mind.  Prior exposure to the right or wrong answers will                make those answers come to mind readily in response to the                      questions, thereby creating illusions of knowing and                            underestimations of question difficulty.  The research will add                 to our understanding of the factors that create errors of memory                and judgment in a variety of domains, including education,                      eyewitness testimony, and clinical memory disorders.",
