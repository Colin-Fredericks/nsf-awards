 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to measure concentrations of metabolic gases, such as               CO2 CH4, O2, H2 and others, can provide insights into                           biogeochemical processes associated with soils or sediments.                    Measurement of these metabolic gases with high resolution is                    limited both by the difficulty of sampling porewaters from                      sediments and by disturbances caused by porewater sampling.  This               research project will measure volatile gases in situ using a                    battery-operated portable mass spectrometer and a small semi-                   permeable probe. The basic portable mass spectrometer has already               been developed.  The present research will focus on development                 of a suitable probe that can be directly inserted into sediments,               as well as augmentation of the mass spectrometer itself.  The                   system will be tested in peatland sediments where distributions                 and gradients of methane, oxygen, carbon dioxide are important                  for understanding the mechanisms of trace gas exchange with the                 atmosphere.  The proposed system, because it is based on a mass                 spectrometer, also has the potential to support in  situ stable                 isotope enrichment studies.",
