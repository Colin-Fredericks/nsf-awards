 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enhancers can be located thousands of base pairs from a gene                    promoter and still stimulate transcription.  Although there is no               definitive data on how enhancers act over such long distances,                  enhancers are widely believed to serve as the binding sites for                 transcription factors which migrate to gene promoters via a looping             out of the intervening DNA.  In contrast to this conventional view,             we have obtained evidence suggesting that the c-fos and polyoma                 enhancers act by inducing a greater accessibility of the DNA                    template as detected by increased DNase I sensitivity.  A major                 goal of this proposal is to test the model that enhancers act at                a distance by increasing the genetic accessibility of chromatin.                To address this objective, enhancers or enhancer deletions will be              inserted into the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT)                gene of male human diploid cells by site-directed homologous                    recombination (gene targeting).  Nuclei from recombinant or wild                type cells resulting from the DNA inserts.  Relative rates of DNase             I sensitivity will be determined by a novel PCR assay that reliably             measures DNA accessibility at any genetic loci in chromatin.                                                                                                    These experiments will determine definitively whether enhancers can             elevate DNase I sensitivity at a locus characterized by low native              DNase I sensitivity.***//",
