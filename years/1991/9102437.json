This award will support a 12-month visit by Dr. Robert                          Miner of the University of Maryland, College Park, with                         Professor H.M. Reimann, Universit\u001at Bern, Switzerland.                          Dr. Miner will investigate quasiconformal equivalence                           classes of spherical CR manifolds based on his earlier                          classification of CR manifolds with amenable holonomy.                          Up to finite cover, such a manifold is either S.n-1, a                          nilmanifold, or the Heisenberg analog of a Hopf manifold,                       a manifold homeomorphic to S1 X S.n.  There is a natural                        notion of a quasiconformal homeomorphism between manifolds                      with CR structures, which he hopes to refine up to                              quasiconformal equivalence.  In his dissertation, Dr.                           Miner showed homeomorphic nilmanifolds arising as covers                        of spherical CR manifolds with amenable holonomy are                            actually quasiconformal.  In dimension three, the                               mappings can be explicitly described.  With Heisenberg                          Hopf manifolds, the question is more difficult.  Dr. Miner                      will explore techniques for analyzing this case, and for                        investigating related questions about quasiconformal                            equivalence of domains of the Heisenberg group.  Eliashberg                     has described invariants of the symplectic manifold                             canonically associated to a CR manifold and has shown that                      certain tori are not quasiconformally equivalent, and these                     invariants may be more widely applicable.  Given a pair of                      domains, one can define an associated pseudoconformal                           capacity, which transforms nicely under quasiconformal                          mappings.  From this, Reimann, Pansu, and others have been                      able to deduce global distortion properties which may be                        useful in analyzing quasiconformal equivalence.  Kor\u001anyi                        and Reimann have developed a theory of deformations of                          quasiconformal mappings on the Heisenberg group.  In some                       cases Goldman and Miner have produced quasiconformal                            mappings by applying this theory, and there is hope it                          can be extended to a wider class of examples.                                                                                                                   The award provides funds for international travel and a                         flat administrative allowance of $250 for his home                              institution.",
