 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use field studies to determine the spatial and                temporal distribution of Pliocene to Recent basic volcanic rocks                in the east-central MVB.  Selected samples will be analyzed for                 major elements, trace elements, Sr, Nd, Pb, and O isotopic                      ratios, in addition to electron microprobe analyses of minerals.                Some of the older rocks will be dated K-Ar methods.  This data                  will be combined with existing data on basic volcanic rocks in                  the MVB to develop and/or test models for the origin of basic                   magmas in the MVB by placing constraints on the composition of                  materials contributing to the source of these basic magmas.  The                project will determine any correlation that exist between the                   distribution of the various types of basic volcanic rocks with                  crustal structure, age of and depth to the subducted lithosphere,               and age of the rocks.  It will also document the occurrence of                  various types of basic volcanic rocks that have only recently                   been recognized to occur in subduction-related volcanic arcs, and               will provide a basis upon which the more common, more                           fractionated, and/or more contaminated calc-alkaline rocks can be               understood.",
