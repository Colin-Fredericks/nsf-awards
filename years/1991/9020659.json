The elimination of UNIDATA support for the VMS operating                 system, in conjunction with other factors, has led to the need to               reconfigure existing equipment and to acquire new equipment.  A                 graphics workstation will be purchased for instruction, image                   analysis, research model development, and data ingest.  The                     workstation will be equipped with a large capacity disk drive,                  backup tape and CD-ROM reader.  The new workstation will allow                  students to have improved access to real-time and archived                      weather data in undergraduate and graduate level classes.  The                  workstation will also provide a means to develop research models                that are impractical using the existing workstations in the                     Department.",
