 "awd_abstract_narration": "All respiring cells must solve the problem of oxidative                       stress, since respiration results in potentially toxic level                    of reactive oxygen species.  Therefore, respiring cells contain                 the enzyme, superoxide dismutase, to catalyze the conversion                    of superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen.                  Manganous superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is found in the                          mitochondria of all multi-cellular eukaryotes, and is present                   in the yeast S. cerevisiae.  The gene encoding MnSOD in yeast                   is called SOD1.  Since the structural gene encoding MnSOD is                    well conserved and MnSOD enzymatic activity is essential for                    respiring cells, some features of SOD1 regulation in yeast are                  likely to be similar or identical to MnSOD gene regulation in                   more complex eukaryotes.  Understanding SOD1 regulation,                        therefore, will contribute valuable information to the field                    of oxidative stress response.  The investigator's objectives                    are to lay the ground work for understanding oxidative stress                   in yeast first, by finding mutants which specifically do not                    transcribe the SOD1 gene using an SOD1-lacZ fusion gene to                      identify these mutants, and standard genetic techniques to                      characterize them.  The second objective is to complete a                       deletion analysis of the SOD1 promoter region of the SOD1-lacZ                  fusion gene by standard techniques.  Included in the                            characterization of both the mutant strains and the promoter                    deletion will be a comparison of the expression of SOD1-lacZ                    in cells grown under anaerobic conditions, normal and higher                    than normal O2 conditions.                                                        This effort concerning the regulation of yeast manganous                      superoxide dismutase by oxygen and heme will broaden the                        knowledge of DNA binding proteins and their regulation and                      function.  The project also furthers VPW program objectives to                  provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     science or engineering through research, and to encourage other                 women to pursue careers in these areas through the                              investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the host                   campuses.  In this project, the proposed activities which                       contribute to the second objective include:  teaching a                         graduate level course entitled, Stress Responses in Eukaryotic                  Cells; organizing a workshop called, Getting There from Here                    about careers in biological science; and teaching a seminar                     course for undergraduate women in biological sciences entitled,                 Finding a Way:  Women, Careers and Modern Biology.",
