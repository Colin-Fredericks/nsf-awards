 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will apply classical test theory to address a                     human performance measurement problem:  Screening workers for                   performance impairment may aid in removing drugs from the                       workplace and improve productivity.  The most straightforward way               to measure performance would seem to be under actual working                    conditions.  In  cases where this has been attempted, however,                  job performance measures were found to be generally insensitive                 to all but the most powerful effects.  A central problem is the                 lack of reliability of on-the-job measures.  However, tests which               possess robust psychometric properties (stability, reliability,                 etc.) have been shown to be sensitive to alcohol, sleep loss,                   hypoxia, halon, and other chemical agents.  Therefore, this                     research will index human performance decrements on a battery of                perceptual, cognitive and motor tests to alcohol dosage (for                    which federally mandated standards already exist for some                       occupations).  Then calibration algorithms would be derived for                 comparing performance changes in blood alcohol concentration                    units to losses from other agents, treatments and stressors for                 which there may be a concern in the work place.  A fully up-and-                running, special purpose test station will be produced.  The                    prototype will contain these algorithms so that they can be set                 to predetermined levels.  In Phase II, additional experimental                  work will be conducted to refine the algorithms, add other                      treatments, and improve the design of the test station by                       conducting test and evaluation at laboratory and work sites.                                                                                                    The availability in an occupational setting of a test station                   which could index performance loss from any cause to a standard                 such as alcohol would have immediate application in industry in                 screening for fitness for duty.  Additionally, monitoring by                    agencies, laboratories, or oneself can be useful in the study of                toxic elements (e.g., asbestos, fluorocarbons), environmental                   agents (motion, radiation), illness (AIDS, dementia), work                      conditions (shift work, exercise), and personal states (aging,                  fatigue, emotional stress).",
