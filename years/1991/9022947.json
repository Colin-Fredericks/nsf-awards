 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the link between the                 volatility in national output and productive efficiency.  The                   first part of the project will focus on developing a theoretical                general-equilibrium-model in which output volatility leads to                   lower economic growth.  It has already been established that in a               static setting that if firms must commit to technology, then                    higher variability in the economy can lead to lower output.  This               important result will be extended to a growth situation by                      formulating a model of endogenous growth with learning-by-doing.                Support for the theoretical results will be provided by expanding               on the preliminary empirical work which shows a strong negative                 relationship between the average and variance of real GNP growth.                                                                                               The second part of the project involves an empirical                            investigation of the theoretical models developed in part one,                  which will focus on a detailed study of plant-level data in the                 U.S. automobile industry.  The data set, which has already been                 collected, contains detailed weekly plant-level data for                        approximately fifty assembly plants for the period 1972 to 1983.                These data will be used to estimate the form of the cost function               in order to understand the effect of output volatility on                       productive efficiency.                                                                                                                                          This research is important because understanding the relationship               between the characteristics of technology and output volatility                 remains central to the study of economic fluctuations.  It is not               clear for example whether firms dampen underlying volatility or                 magnify it.  Also, it is very unclear as to what aspects of                     technology lead to such behavior and how output volatility                      affects productivity of the firm.",
