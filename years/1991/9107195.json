 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research constitutes the first comprehensive study of                 interactions between neotropical red mangroves, Rhizophora                      mangle, and epibionts that live on its aerial roots.  Mangroves                 cover>75% of sheltered tropical coastlines.  studies of these                   ubiquitous communities will expand our understanding of the                     structure and maintenance of these coastal systems, and clarify                 how such process may be altered by the organisms themselves.                    This research also should elucidate hitherto unappreciated direct               and indirect interactions between trees and benthic                             invertebrates.  This project specially seeks to foster                          undergraduate training and participation in tropical research.                       The research program will expand upon four years of work in                the extensive mangal of Belize, Central America.  Epibionts will                be selectivity removed and added to roots of seedlings, sapling,                and mature trees.  Effects of these treatments on surviorship,                  stem and root growth, leaf production, and rootlet proliferation                will be monitored.  The project will investigate mechanisms by                  which epibionts influence tree growth, and will determine whether               sponges are involved in nitrogen fixation for mangroves.  The                   research will further assess if epibionts alter the rate of                     sediment accretion under saplings and matures trees, thereby                    influencing mangal ontogeny.  Knowledge of processes that                       structure and maintain mangal will inform the wise use and                      conservation of these widespread communities.",
