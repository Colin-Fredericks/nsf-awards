First the resign of such a                    problem will be undertaken by a consortium that consists of                     faculty from a research university, members from a national                     laboratory, and members of an institute for research on                         learning together with middle school teachers.  The research                    will address how does working on such problems link up with                     the practice of symbolic skills; connect to mathematical                        idealizations, e.g. how should the students understanding of                    linear functions be introduced and emphasized; require                          additional understanding in subject matter and pedagogy for                     the teacher.  Also the questions of assessment of students                      will be studied.  A project report of the research findings                     will be made available for other developers of this type of                     materials.",
