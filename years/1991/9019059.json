 "awd_abstract_narration": "The influence of human activities on Antarctic ecosystems is an                 important issue in this pristine and fragile environment.  In                   particular, the release of untreated sewage from McMurdo Station                has drawn considerable attention from envirnomental groups.  At the             same time, very little is known about the persistence of enteric                indicator and pathogenic bacteria in the Antarctic marine                       environment.  McFeters proposes to address key questions that                   relate to the potential public health and environmental impact of               releasing untreated sewage into Antarctic sea water.  Moreover, it              is hypothesized that the sewage plume does not extend to the area               of the potable water intake for McMurdo Station.  This hypothesis               remains untested in view of the extended  persistence of enteric                bacteria and currents in McMurdo Sound.  McFeters will describe the             extent of the sewage plume under maximal occupancy circumstances                at McMurdo Station and the potential health as well as                          environmental consequences of the present sewage disposal                       practices.  Such information will be applicable to other polar                  regions where increasing human activity poses a threat to the local             ecosystem.",
