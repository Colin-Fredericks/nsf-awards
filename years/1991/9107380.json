 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past ten years, mathematical models of infectious                 disease have elucidated the impact of natural selection upon                    pathogen virulence.  Specifically, whether natural selection will               lead to higher or lower virulence is thought to depend upon the                 effect of virulence upon disease transmissibility.  The                         investigators propose to test this hypothesis by using two clones               of the nuclear polythedrosis virus of gypsy moth, Lymantria                     dispar; these clones are of very different virulence and can be                 identified from field samples on the basis of restriction                       endonuclease maps.  A combination of laboratory measurements and                small-scale field experiments will be used to estimate different                aspects of the transmissibility of the two clones.  These                       estimates will be used to predict which clone will predominate in               the field.  This prediction will be tested by seeding 1 hectare                 plots with disinfected gypsy moth eggs, and simultaneously                      introducing both clones of the virus.  Competitive superiority                  will be indicated by which clone infects more larvae over the                   course of an epizootic.                                                              Assumptions about the evolution of pathogen virulence have                 influenced research on disease ecology for decades, but have been               largely untested.  The work that is proposed here will greatly                  reduce the gap between theory and reality in the study of the                   evolutionary ecology of disease.",
