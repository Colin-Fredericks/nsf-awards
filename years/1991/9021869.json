 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Duke                University for the renovation and repair of the Biological                      Sciences Building which houses that institution's Departments of                Botany and Zoology and the School of Forestry and Environmental                 Studies and thus its systematics, ecology, physiology, genetics,                cell, molecular, and other biological research and research                     training activities.  This building was constructed in 1961, and                there has been no renovation of the building's basic systems since              its construction.  The ARFMP grant of $1,900,000 and $2,939,335                 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize               these research and research training facilities.  This project will             address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by              providing conditions compatible with new techniques and                         methodologies of biology which require accurate environmental                   control, stable and sufficient electrical power, pure water supply,             and ready access to local and international computer networks.  The             renovation will also assure a flexible infrastructure enabling the              support of developing and currently unforeseen areas of biological              investigation that could not otherwise be pursued.                                                                                                              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.                Students trained in these laboratories will have access to a                    stable, reliable environment which is necessary for the                         preservation of collections, for long-term experimentation and                  research, and for the operation of computers and sophisticated                  scientific equipment.",
