Specific objectives of this initial phase                           includes determination of the characteristics of an                             electron-beam sustained-discharge that must operate in                          contaminated air mixtures, theoretical studies to identify                                                                                                      the primary chemical mechanisms that must be known for                          efficient operation of the process and design of the                            approach by which the commercial feasibility of this                            concept will be determined.                                                                                                                                     This is a Phase I award made in accord with Program                             Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business Innovation Research                                                                                                      (SBIR).  The project addresses a significant problem in                         dealing with treatment of combustion gases prior to their                       emission to the atmosphere to reduce emissions of air                           pollutants. It may find applicability to treatment of                           emissions from oil, gas and coal-fired power plants, trash                                                                                                      incinerators and from industrial processes for production                       of chemicals and application of coatings.                                                                                                                       Award of an SBIR Phase I is recommended as proposed.",
