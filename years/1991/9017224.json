 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phytoplankton, as dominant primary producers of the world's                     oceans, are important components in the biogeochemical cycling                  of many elements. There is a lack of information, however, as to                the role of phytoplankton in the biogeochemical cycling of iodine               specifically in terms of fluxes, metabolism and reservoir size.                 This project seeks to address this deficiency by using important                marine phytoplankton (diatoms, dinoflagellates,                                 coccolithophores, cyanobacteria) in experiments to determine: 1)                iodide and iodate uptake rates (using radioactive 125I); 2) the                 concentration and chemical speciation of cellular iodine  by                    using iodide selective electrodes, extraction techniques, and                   125I labeled cultures; 3) release rates of both volatile                        (primarily methyl iodide, using gas chromatography with an                      electron capture detector) and non-volatile cellular iodocarbons                (125I labeled cultures), and 4) the presence of haloperoxidases                 in phytoplankton (spectrophotometric and radioisotopic methods).                The data obtained from these investigations will allow for the                  unambiguous assessment of the degree in which phytoplankton are                 involved in the chemical speciation of iodine in surface waters                 and their participation in the transport of iodine from the                     surface waters to the atmosphere and to deeper waters. This                     research has application to the marine and atmospheric iodine                   cycles, which takes on added importance based on past and                       potential releases of anthropogenic radionuclides of iodine.",
