 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators continue studies of the effect                           that symmetry has on the solutions of differential equations.                   Three particular topics are the stability of heteroclinic                       cycles (which is related to the existence of intermittency and                  bursting phenomena), the symmetry of chaotic attractors (which                  may be related to some of the distinctive patterns observed in                  turbulent fluid flow), and the coupling of gauge and spatial                    symmetries (such as occurs in the Ginzburg-Landau model for                     superconductivity).  They will also attempt to relate their                     results to specific experiments.  They believe that both the                    bursting phenomena associated with heteroclinic cycles and the                  symmetry-increasing bifurcations of chaotic attractors have                     been observed in the Couette-Taylor experiment; part of their                   work will be to make these connections more precise.                                 Many models of physical phenomena including topics as                      diverse as the transition from conduction to convection in fluid                dynamics and the ways in which animals walk contain symmetries in               their formulation.  These symmetries are known to influence the                 kinds of solutions that are found in such models.  Most previous                work has focused on the kinds of equilibria and periodic                        solutions that appear.  This project undertakes to broaden the                  class of solutions that are studied to include such topics as                   chaos and intermittency in symmetric systems.  Recent research                  and experiments indicate that this is both reasonable and                       tractable.",
