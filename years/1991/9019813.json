 "awd_abstract_narration": "The influence of preferential diffusion of reactant species on                  the propagation of a flame through a turbulent gaseous                          fuel/oxidizer mixture is to be studied by a series of                           experiments in a constant volume, fan-stirred combustion                        chamber.  The velocity field and turbulence quantities will be                  measured using two-point laser velocimetry and particle-image                   velocimetry, and laser flame tomography will be used to                         determine the instantaneous flame surface.                                      Hydrogen/oxygen/nitrogen mixtures producing preferential                        diffusion with a stabilizing influence on the flame structure                   will be chosen to cover a wide range of laminar flame speeds,                   and the turbulence intensity and integral scale of the                          reactants will be  controlled independently.  The test range                    will involve the thin laminar flamelet regime for turbulent                     Reynolds numbers up to 10,000.  The flame propagation process                   will be simulated theoretically using statistical time-series                   techniques as a way to interpret the measurements, and as a                     way to initiate the development of a computationally tractable                  predictive tool which includes a rational treatment of the                      flow physics.                                                                                                                                                   Understanding the interaction between turbulence and the speed                  with which a flame propagates into a combustible mixture is a                   fundamental issue in combustion science.  The results of this                   research will provide insight into one aspect of this complex                   phenomena, with applications possible to internal combustion                    engines and turbulent premixed combustion processes in                          general.",
