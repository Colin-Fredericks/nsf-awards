 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mariculture operations must extend farther out to sea to                        achieve greater water circulation volumes to dilute fish                        farm washes.  In  realizing such developments, one faces                        substantial engineering challenges.  Prominent among these                      challenges are achieving the seaworthiness of the                               infrastructure, i.e., the containment system for the                            cultivars (pens, cages, and so forth), the improvement of                       construction materials in off-shore installations,                              primarily for the reduction of fouling; and the adaptation                      of containment or retention methods to the biological                           exigencies of the cultivars.                                                                                                                                    This engineering workshop focuses on the research needs to                      solve these problems and will invite internationally-known                      engineers and marine scientists from the following                              countries:  Japan, France, Canada, and Norway.  These                           countries have extensive federal and private sector off-                        shore mariculture research and development programs.                            Exchange of information on engineering approaches to off-                       shore mariculture promises a clearer definition of where                        engineering problems lie and how research activities                            should be formulated and organized to overcome these                            problems.",
