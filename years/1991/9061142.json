 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of a simple, efficient, nonchemistry-specific                   effluent treatment system would be of tremendous benefit to                     the semiconductor process industry.  The scrubber proposed in                   this SBIR project would remove reaction by-products from the                    process exhaust by condensation onto cryogenically cooled                       surfaces.  Once condensed as liquid or solid, the waste would                   be separated mechanically, nonhazardous material would be                       released, toxic material would be incinerated, and the ash                      collected for hazardous waste disposal.                                                                                                                         A secondary objective of the research is to examine the                         feasibility of using the (liquid) nitrogen as the working                       fluid of a heat engine, to extract waste heat as work from the                  gas stream.  The final goal of the research will be a                           commercial system which will liquefy air, separate out the                      oxygen from the nitrogen, condense and then incinerate the                      waste from industrial effluent, condense the waste from the                     incineration, and use the energy thus collected to liquefy                      more air.  Such a system may well be able to generate excess                    energy, as well as decrease toxic waste emissions.",
