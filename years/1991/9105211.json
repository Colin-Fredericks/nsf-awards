 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photoionization cross sections and photoelectric angular                   distribution asymmetry parameters will be calculated for                        excited states of atoms and ions over a broad range of hv, n, 1,                nuclear charge and stage of ionization, employing Hartree Slater                wave functions.  Oscillator strengths and discrete to discrete                  transitions will also be studied.  The investigation will focus                 on understanding the systematics of variation of the Cross                      sections and angular distributions over the periodic system.                    Hartree Fock calculations will be done for any of                               these transactions, as may be warranted, for greater accuracy.                  Isoelectronic sequences will be investigated to study the                       gradual change in behavior towards hydrogenic.  Changes in                      photoionization pattern over isonuclear and iso-ionic                           sequences will also be looked into.                                                  To fully understand the interaction of photons with                        matter, radiative recombination cross sections.  Consequently                   every system investigated for photoionization will also be                      investigated for radiative recombination.                                            The method at present employed is a little restrictive in                  the sense that a study of the very highly excited states                        becomes impossible due to a numerical problem of convergence,  To               overcome this computational limitation, an attempt will be made                 at formulating a new methodology based on the quantum                           defect theory.",
