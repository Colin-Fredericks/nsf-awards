 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with ultrasonic Lamb                                 waves, which are elastic waves that propagate in                                plates of finite thickness.  Our interest in these waves                        has been stimulated by the developments of the last                             2-3 years during which Lamb wave devices have been                              successfully fabricated on plates that are thinner than                         1 um.  Waves propagating in such thin structures                                possess a number of attractive features for use in                              physical, chemical, and biological sensors.  Lamb                               waves also provide a convenient tool for measuring                              the elastic properties of self-supporting thin films and                        microminiature mechanical structures.                                                                                                                           The aim of this project is to carry out theoretical and                         experimental investigation of the generation and                                detection of Lamb waves.  Four different device                                 configurations will be considered.  These are:  (1)                             piezoelectric plate excited by surface electrodes, (2)                          composite membrane consisting of piezoelectric film                             deposited on a nonpiezoelectric plate, (3)                                      electrostrictive excitation in a nonpiezoelectric plate,                        and (4) excitation of Lamb waves in a                                           nonpiezoelectric plate using surface stress sources.                            Results obtained from theoretical analysis will be                              experimentally verified.  Besides enabling us to                                completely characterize a given transducer, the                                 proposed research will also lead to the design of                               more efficient Lamb wave transducers.",
