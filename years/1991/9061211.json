 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the proposed research we will develop methodologies and                      products for mapping very large pieces of DNA by determining                    the overlapping relationships between clones derived from a                     partial digest of the DNA.  The method will create the                          possibility of ordering end-to-end a large number of partial-                   digest cosmid clones derived from segments of DNA as large as                   an entire human chromosome.  The proposed method involves                       crosshybridization of the inserts from a large number of                        cosmid clones to each other independently in all combinations                   by applying cloned DNA or probes generated from the clones to                   short pieces of thread.  These threads are subsequently woven                   in order into cloth.  The intersection points of the threads                    crossing each other in the cloth allows for discrete                            hybridization of all cloned DNAs separately and independently                   to all probes generated from the same set of clones and,                        therefore, allows for simultaneous determination of the                         overlap between all clones in the set.  The proposed method,                    if implemented, would be very powerful for its intended                         purpose and would reduce the clone ordering task into a                         simplified, standardized, and easily repeatable protocol.  In                   phase I work, we propose to try the method on the E.coli                        genome so that the procedure can be verified and optimized                      before attempting an entire human chromosome overlapping                        clone determination from a preexisting flow-sorted,                             chromosome-specific library.",
