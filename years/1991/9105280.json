 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nifA gene product (NIFA protein) is required to activate                    transcription of the nitrogen fixation (nif) operons in a wide                  variety of gram-negative bacteria belonging to the phylum \"Purple               bacteria and their relatives\".  To activate, NIFA binds to sites                100 bp upstream of nif promoters and allows RNA polymerase sigma                (54 holoenzyme form) to denature the DNA strands around the                     transcription startsite- that is, to isomerize from closed to open              complexes.  We succeeded in demonstrating activity of the NIFA                  protein from Klebsiella pneumonia in vitro by developing an assay               that allowed us to detect activity in crude preparations.  We found             that NIFA is assisted in activating transcription by the                        integration host factor (IHF), a small protein that bends the DNA               between upstream NIFA sites and nif promoters to increase contracts             between the activator and polymerase.  During the next grant                    period, we will attempt to purify active NIFA and study its                     properties-its DNA-binding and its presumed ATPase activity, which              is rare for transcriptional activators.  In addition, we will use               electron microscopy to characterize specialized nucleoprotein                   structures (SNUPS) that form at nif promoters in the presence of                activator, polymerase, and IHF.  In the presence of the NIFL                    protein, Klebsiella NIFA is inactivated by molecular oxygen or                  combined nitrogen.  We will attempt to demonstrate this                         inactivation convincingly in crude preparations and, using it as                an assay, to purify and characterize NIFL.",
