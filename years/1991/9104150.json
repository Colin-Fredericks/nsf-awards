 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geminiviruses constitute a family of plant viruses with single-                 stranded DNA genomes that replicate via double-stranded DNA                     intermediates in the nuclei of infected cells.  They encode a                   single protein for their replication and can recruit the remainder              of the replication machinery from their host.  These                            characteristics suggest that geminiviruses are excellent models for             studying plant nuclear DNA replication.  The overall goal of our                research is to understand the molecular events that mediate                     geminivirus DNA replication using tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV)             as our prototype.  We will identify the TGMV replication origin by              deletion analysis and by assaying viral DNA fragments for their                 ability to support replication of nonviral DNA in plant                         protoplasts.  The sequence and structural requirements of the TGMV              origin will be characterized by analyzing replications containing               site-specific mutations.  Our initial studies of trans-acting                   factors involved in replication will focus on the single TGMV-                  encoded protein, AL1, required for replication.  Two important                  questions we will ask are does AL1 bind specifically to the TGMV                replication origin and what is its catalytic role in replication.               We plan to purify AL1, study its catalytic properties, and                      determine if it requires host proteins for activity.                                                                                                            The long term goal of our research is to identify and characterize              the plant proteins involved in TGMV replication and to determine                their roles in normal cellular processes.***//",
