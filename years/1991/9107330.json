 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although great progress in understanding the variation in plant                 mating systems has been made in the past century, most studies have             focused on the role of the negative effects of inbreeding.                      Recently, a different approach has been developed, one that is                  based on a general analysis of plant reproduction and pollination               biology.  It assumes that rates of self-fertilization are                       determined, at least in part, by the relative amount of self and                outcross pollen on stigmas--an assumption called the mass-action                assumption.  Preliminary work suggests that models incorporating                the mass-action assumption may be able to explain the full range                of observed plant mating systems, even without considering the                  effects of inbreeding.  This preliminary work will be extended in               two ways.  First, the mathematical models will be extended to                   include (1) a more realistic representation of the spatial                      structure of plant populations and (2) inbreeding depression.                   Second, experimental tests of the model predictions will be made                by taking advantage of a well studied mating system polymorphism                in Senecio vulgaris (1) to make direct estimates of the key                     features of the model in natural and experimental populations and               (2) to investigate the role of frequency-dependent pollen export                in maintenance of the variations in mating system.",
