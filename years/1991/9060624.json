 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovative materials are needed to encourage women to consider                  careers in science.  A comprehensive, multimedia database with                  text, graphics, photographs and audio could highlight women's                   achievements in science and provide an exciting tool for student                research and a source of entertaining, interactive presentations.               While CD-ROM (Compact Disc - Read-Only Memory) technology can                   theoretically deliver multimedia databases, almost no research has              been conducted to date on how to design such programs.                                                                                                          Phase I will examine the feasibility of an interactive multimedia               database on the topic of women in science.  The study will analyze              the appropriate content, audience needs, delivery system and design             options for a program aimed at students in grades 4-8.  A prototype             example will then be designed and created using HyperCard software              and a hard disk drive to model a CD-ROM delivery system.  The                   anticipated results of Phase I are a prototype that demonstrates                the feasibility of producing a CD-ROM multimedia database on women              in science and a set of design guidelines for the Phase II product.             Phase II will result in a well designed, audiovisual, historical                record of the achievements of women scientists that will be of                  interest to students, educators and career counselors.",
