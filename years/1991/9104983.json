 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are derived by cyclization of              prenyl pyrophosphates to olefins followed by oxidative modification             initiated by cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylation.  Studies with             two sesquiterpene cyclases, differing in physical properties and                reaction complexity, will test the hypothesis that the same active              site residues play similar roles in the electrophilic mechanism of              this enzyme type.  Studies with three closely-related (-)-limonene              hydroxylases, that differ in position of allylic hydroxylation of               this simple monoterpene olefin, will test the proposal that minor               alterations in active site topography underlie regiochemistry of                oxygen insertion by these cytochrome P450 enzymes.  Homogeneous                 proteins will be used to generate antibodies and partial amino acid             sequences, and a molecular cloning and expression strategy adopted              to obtain complete primary sequences and larger amounts of the                  enzymes.  Radioactive modifying reagents will be employed to                    selectively label active site cysteine and histidine residues of                the cyclases, and photolabile substrate analogs will be utilized                to label hydrophobic regions of both cyclase and hydroxylase sites.             Active site peptides will be prepared, sequenced, compared, and                 located on the proteins.  The role of specific residues in cyclase              catalysis will be determined by protection against chemical                     modification using analogs representing different substrate binding             domains, and by directed mutagenesis.  Limonene-tethered heme-                  directed inhibitors, as well as 19F-NMR methods, will be used to                probe the spatial relationship between the heme iron of the                     cytochromes and the limonene substrate.  These studies will provide             new information on the nature of these novel cyclase and                        hydroxylase catalysts and a clearer understanding of the origin of              terpenoid natural products.                                                                                                                                     Terpenoids play an important role in the interaction of the plant               with its environment.  An understanding of terpenoid biochemistry               will allow a deeper understanding of the role of these compounds                in plants.  In addition to the well known essential oils of resins              of commerce, serious consideration is being given to nontraditional             uses of these plant metabolites as renewable sources of energy-                 intensive chemicals.  A broad range of terpenoids are of                        pharmacological significance and many are of agrochemical utility.              New knowledge gained from this work will assist in efforts to                   increase the production of these valuable plant metabolites.//",
