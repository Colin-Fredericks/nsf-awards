 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this work is to delineate the factors                     which control electron transfer in biological systems                           specifically in cytochromes c and b5.  (1) The role of protein                  surface charges will be evaluated by studying cytochromes with                  altered electrostatic surfaces.  (2) The rate constant for                      electron transfer is thought to decrease exponentially with                     distance; this distance dependence may in turn be a function                    of the driving force for the reaction.  Dr. Dixon will make a                   series of cytochromes b5. with increasing steric bulk at the                    electron transfer site.  Rate constants at different driving                    forces will be measured.  The resulting matrix of rate                          constants will be used to assess the dependence of electron                     transfer on distance and driving force.  (3) Dr. Dixon will use                 NMR techniques to measure both electron transfer rate constants                 and protein motions for a series of cytochromes c in an effect                  to understand the molecular basis of conformational and                         reorganizational control of electron transfer.  Particular                      emphasis will be placed on the structure of cytochrome c as a                   function of ionic strength, on the kinetics of the reversible                   loss of the axial methionine and on the roles of residues near                  the heme in controlling electron transfer.",
