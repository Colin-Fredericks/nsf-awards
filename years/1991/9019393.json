 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this project is to investigate the relationship           between the structure of parallel algorithms and the structure of               parallel computing systems.  It seems clear that it will be necessary           to match the structure of an algorithm to the structure of the                  parallel computer on which it executes in order to realize the                  computing power of the parallel system.  Whether this matching is done          by the applications programmer or a compiler, a basic understanding of          the structural relationship between parallel algorithms and parallel            computer organization will be needed.  This investigation proposed              here will provide needed insight into this process.                                                                                                             During the phase of the project covered in this proposal, the                   investigation will concentrate on the basic question of how the                 structure and design of a parallel computing system's interconnection           network affects the overall performance of the system.  The                     interconnection network provides communication paths between the                modules of a parallel system and is a major source of system overhead.          For Parallel systems composed of a large number of processors, this             overhead can significantly reduce the system's performance relative to          its theoretical maximum.  This project will evaluate the effect of              this overhead using the Rice Parallel Processing Testbed, a                     sophisticated simulation system developed for predicting the                    performance of real parallel programs executing on parallel                     processors.",
