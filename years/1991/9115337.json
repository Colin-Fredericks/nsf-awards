 "awd_abstract_narration": "The apparent paradox of high nutrients/low phytoplankton                        populations in some areas of the open ocean has challenged                      oceanographers for many years.  Hypotheses to explain it include                the regulation of productivity by light, temperature, zooplankton               grazing, and trace metal limitation and/or toxicity in these                    regions.  To date, none of the hypotheses, or combinations                      thereof, has emerged as a widely accepted explanation for why the               nitrogen and phosphorus are not depleted in these areas of the                  oceans.  Recently, new evidence has supported the hypothesis that               iron deficiency limits phytoplankton growth in Subarctic and                    Antarctic waters.  This evidence has stimulated discussions of                  the feasibility of fertilizing parts of the oceans with iron, and               thus sequestering additional atmospheric CO2 in the deep oceans                 where it would be bound over the next few centuries.  The                       economic, social, and ethical issues surrounding such a                         proposition, along with the outstanding scientific issues,                      justify rigorous discussion, debate, and publication on the topic               of regulation of productivity in these regions.  To this end, The               American Society of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) held a                    symposium on the topic of \"What controls phytoplankton in                       nutrient-rich areas of the open sea?\"  ASLO now seeks funding to                cover the costs of publishing a special symposium issue of                      Limnology and Oceanography, to provide a written record of the                  symposium proceedings.",
