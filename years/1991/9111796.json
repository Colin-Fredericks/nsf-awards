One of the most                                             important areas is the effects of                                               immobilization on the intrinsic                                                 metabolism of the cells employed.                                               Little has been reported,                                                       particularly with respect to E.                                                 coli, on how immobilization affects                                             carbon flow, energy production, and                                             product formation.  Preliminary                                                 results have shown that significant                                             changes in metabolism occur upon                                                immobilization.  E. coli cells                                                  grown in alginate synthesize                                                    significantly more                                                              beta-galactosidase per cell, and                                                elevated quantities of the normal                                               metabolic byproducts acetate,                                                   pyruvate, and lactate, compared to                                              free cells. These results support                                               the hypothesis that immobilization                                              changes the relative rates of                                                   carbon consumption and growth.                                                                                                                                  The specific objectives of this                                                 work are to test the following two                                              hypotheses: i) that the excess                                                  carbon consumed by immobilized                                                  cells is diverted to the synthesis                                              of acid byproducts or of inducible                                              protein; and ii) that mass transfer                                             limitations on the removal of acid                                              byproducts cause the observed                                                   changes in metabolism.  The                                                     ultimate goal is to exploit                                                     immobilization-induced metabolic                                                changes for the overproduction of                                               recombinant proteins.",
