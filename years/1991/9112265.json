 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to an interdisciplinary team of                     researchers to identify functional and disfunctional mechanisms in              use in designing technologies for the workplace.  The study evolves             from the investigators' prior work in the Shop Floor Programming                Project (SFPP) at the University of Lowell.  The SFPP's goal was                to create machinist-friendly software, to overcome rigid divisions              of labor that assign programming functions to engineers and                     executing functions to machinists.  Computer scientists and                     engineers have found it difficult to work with machinists so as to              enable them to retain or augment a decision making role in using                graphics-based software.  These difficulties mean that innovation               and flexibility are lost in the workplace.  This project proceeds               by contrasting skill-based with heirarchical or Taylorist                       principles, in the observation of the interactions of machinists                and computer scientists and manufacturing engineers in the SFPP.                The study will record meetings and working sessions on videotape                for transcription and conduct group sessions for analysis of the                tapes; examine documents, artifacts, and working journals from SFPP             participants; and revise the theoretical framework based on                     findings.  The software generated by the SFPP can itself be                     analyzed for what it reveals about assumptions and values.  Results             will include hands-on development and implementation of skill-based             technological systems, publications in periodicals that reach                   professional, managerial, and worker communities, speaking                      engagements, exchanges among people working on these issues in the              U.S. and abroad, and planning for curriculum development in                     undergraduate science and engineering.                                                                                                                          The topic of this proposal is of highest priority for Ethics and                Values Studies.  The qualifications and track record of these                   investigators are excellent.  The project provides an important                 test for theories and methodologies to study innovation in the                  workplace.  Results will be useful for a wide range of individuals              and groups.  The proposal is recommended for support.",
