 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)                   project is on the development of a novel Stirling micro-                        refrigerator for cold electronics.  This silicon and glass                      machine is to be batch fabricated by micromachining techniques                  developed in the silicon sensor industry.  Despite its small                    size (approximately one cubic centimeter), the micro-                           refrigerator will pump practical amounts of heat by operating                   at much higher frequencies than previously thought possible                     for Stirling cycle machines.  Heat transfer and losses in                       Stirling cycle machines, like those in other fluid dynamic                      systems, depend not on individual operating quantities such as                  frequency or speed, but rather on dimensionless groups of                       quantities, such as Reynold's number and Valensi number.                        These dimensionless groups permit losses to be controlled by                    compensating for high frequencies by means of small                             dimensions.  Our analysis of a preliminary design describes a                   machine that is 30 times smaller with 100 times more heat                       lifting capacity than the most advanced miniature Stirling                      cryocooler yet described in the scientific literature.                                                                                                          In this research, two theoretical and practical feasibility                     issues will be addressed.  We will identify fundamental                         limitations and opportunities by analyzing the complex heat                     transfer and friction factor coefficients at high frequencies                   and small dimensions, and we will examine the extent to which                   the proposed micro-refrigerator can be manufactured by                          existing processes employed in the commercial silicon sensor                    industry.  We will also design a thermally and fluid-                           dynamically \"similar\" Stirling refrigerator in larger                           dimensions and in conventional materials for later                              experimental verification of analyses with conventional                         instrumentation.",
