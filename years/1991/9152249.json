 "awd_abstract_narration": "Presently two required laboratory courses are offered to                        undergraduate astronomy majors - a junior level astronomical                    techniques course and a senior levels projects course.  Both                    courses need The project is updating two required laboratory                    courses to include material beyond photoelectric techniques for                 performing stellar photometry by expanding them to include a                    variety of topics in imaging, with a special emphasis on noise                  analysis.  The generation, manipulation, detection, and                         computer processing of images is covered.  An imaging lab has                   been set up to include a uniform light source with a pattern                    projector, a simple dispersive spectrograph on an optical                       bench, a high quality optical CCD imaging camera with a                         programmable readout and control circuit, noise analysis                        instrumentation, and an image acquisition and processing                        computer.  A variety of experiments are done, including                         spectroscopy of atomic lines and continuum sources, image                       acquisition and calibration, noise and signal-to-noise                          analysis, the statistics of photon detection and Poisson                        distributions, the concept of a digital image and its                           processing, image quality and its effect on point source                        detectability, the effect of electronic noise on image quality,                 and the theory and practice of computer interfaces to modern                    instrumentation.  These are incorporated into the junior level                  lab as structured exercises performed in groups of two students                 alternating with existing projects and classroom lectures.                      Seniors undertake special projects with one-on-one supervision                  to develop new experiments for incorporation into the junior                    level course.  The laboratory gives students a comprehensive                    exposure to imaging theory and techniques in a practical and                    involved environment.",
