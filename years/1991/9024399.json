New                technologies, interdisciplinary challenges, and significant                     progress on many ecological fronts provide exciting opportunities               for advances in the 1990's.  Furthermore, urgent problems such as               environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity,  and change in                 global climate emphasize the need for sound ecological                          information and understanding.  Resources to obtain this basic                  ecological knowledge are limited, and a comprehensive evaluation                of research priorities is therefore crucial for the wise use of                 research support.                                                                    The Ecological Society of America will publish the revised                 report \"The Sustainable Biosphere Initiative:  An Ecological                    Research Agenda for the Nineties\" with funding provided by this                 award.  In addition the Society will conduct a workshop to plan                 the further dissemination of the report and to organize                         subsequent, topical workshops which will further define the                     research opportunities, needs and priorities for the 1990's.                    These activities will provide valuable input for the ecological                 science community and for the federal government as both strive                 to improve the base for more cost effective research in ecology//",
