 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine the                               feasibility of using discarded vehicle tires for producing                      marketable forms of carbon.  The project consists of                            developing a predictive model of physical and chemical                          changes that occur during carbonization, use of the model                       to suggest modifications in processing the tires,                               monitoring of carbonization itself and use of data                              obtained to refine starting conditions and monitoring                           procedures.                                                                                                                                                     This is a Phase I award made in accord with Program                             Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business Innovation Research                      (SBIR).  The project deals with an approach to pollution                        prevention by use of discarded materials as sources of                          useful materials.  If proven feasible, this concept would                       reduce pollution associated with deterioration of                               discarded rubber products and eliminate the potential for                       ignition of accumulations of used tires which during                            combustion result in emissions of air pollutants.",
