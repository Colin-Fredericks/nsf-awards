 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently we performed a time-resolved experiment                                which clearly demonstrates the effect of the surface                            space-charge field on the depletion region carrier                              dynamics in GaAs.  These studies can potentially                                yield considerable insight into carrier transport                               properties near semiconductor surfaces and buried                               semiconductor interfaces, and in submicron devices,                             where the surface space-charge field spans most, if                             not all, of the semiconductor device structure.                                 We propose several important new extensions of                                  our experimental studies.  First, we propose to                                 enhance our current measurement technique by                                    utilizing variable wavelength probe pulses.  This will                          permit us to vary our information depth within the                              surface space-charge region in our experiments,                                 facilitating a more quantitative theoretical model of                           the depletion region carrier transport.  Second, we                             would like to extend our measurements to include                                other systems, such as silicon device structures,                               GaAs/ZnSe buried interfaces, and semiconductor/                                 metal interfaces.  Third, we would like to extend                               our measurements into the variable pump intensity                               regime, enabling us to include photomodulation                                  effects of the surface or interface space-charge                                field. These measurements will provide a detailed                               picture of the dynamics of the screening process at                             a semiconductor surface or interface, enabling us to                            analyze structures with inhomogeneous dopant                                    densities directly adjacent to an interface.",
