 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this program is to conduct a three day                           conference to develop guidelines for the pre-college                            teaching of genetic engineering, and for the preparation of                     teachers and the formation of networks and partnerships                         that facilitate the introduction of high quality, up-to-                        date, science education about genetic engineering.                              Conference participants will include biology teachers                           experienced in teaching genetic engineering;  Teacher                           Enhancement project personnel who are experienced in this                       and related areas, and other individuals experienced in                         alliances, partnerships and networking in support of                            science education programs in biotechnology.                                                                                                                    The conference will address three main areas relative to                        genetic engineering: 1) pre-college academic content,                           including basic biology of genetic engineering,                                 technological applications, social\\ethical issues, and                          economic issues, 2) teacher enhancement, and 3) the role of                     alliances, partnerships and networks in implementing new                        science education programs. Pre-conference papers will be                       developed in each of these three areas so that conference                       participants can respond to them. Discussion results will                       then be used to produce a set of recommended guidelines for                     future teacher enhancement programs in the area of genetic                      engineering. The guidelines, along with the pre-conference                      papers, will be incorporated into a Conference Report that                      will be made available to all interested individuals.                                                                                                           An amount equal to 13.5% of NSF costs will be provided as                       cost sharing.",
