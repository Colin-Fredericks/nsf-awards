 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary challenge facing systematists working with DNA                 sequence characters is to distinguish plylogenetically                          informative change from the larger set of character change                      determined.  Sequence informativeness varies due to variable                    rates of evolutionary change within and among nucleotide                        sequences.  Meeting the challenge stated above, thus, requires                  systematists to learn about the variable nature and rate of                     change for DNA sequence characters.                                                  The early history of extant avian lineages remains poorly                  known, with conflicting hypotheses denoting a shortage of                       informative characters.  Resolution of relationships among avian                orders is central to a larger debate concerning the reliability                 and merits of alternative phylogenetic methods.                                      In seeking to address issues of molecular systematics                      methods and avian phylogeny together, the objectives of the                     proposed research are:  1) to determine phylogenetic                            relationships for the avian orders Anseriformes and Galliformes,                and their placement relative to Paleognathae (ratites and                       tinamous) and Neognathae (all other extant birds); 2) to                        determine relative rates of change for DNA sequence characters,                 and assess their application to phylogenetic analyses; and 3) to                assess effects of different alignment strategies in phylogenetic                analyses.                                                                            Mitochondrial DNA will be extracted from tissues, and 12S                  ribosomal RNA and cytochrome oxidase I genes will be amplified                  via the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced using standard                  dideoxy chain termination techniques.                                                The proposed research is expected to improve significantly                 our knowledge of phylogenetic relationships among early diverging               avian lineages, and to provide fundamental information regarding                phylogenetic methods broadly applicable within the field of                     systematics.",
