 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for                Undergraduates Site in the Department of Psychology at                          Pennsylvania State University for another three years.  Eight                   undergraduate psychology majors with an interest in the                         biological aspects of experimental psychology will be recruited                 to participate in this program at the completion of their                       sophomore or junior year.  An effort will be made to attract                    women and minority students using the techniques and contacts                   which have enabled staff to train over 43 minority Ph.D.s since                 1969 and ten minority students in past REU programs.  The                       students selected will work as apprentices with one of eight                    members of the faculty, all nationally known for their research                 and all highly experienced at preparing undergraduates who have                 gone on to graduate school.  This faculty has received a major                  equipment grant from the U.S. Department of Education that has                  provided facilities for research and training.  The program is                  designed to have the students work full-time for eight weeks in                 the summer, gradually exposing them to all aspects of                           psychophysiological research and to selected aspects of                         perception and cognitive and physiological psychology.  Students                will design an independent research project during the latter                   part of the summer and complete it with the help of their Penn                  State mentor during the following academic year.  At the end of                 the spring semester, they will present their research results at                a department colloquium.  Every effort will be made to encourage                and assist students to gain admission to graduate programs.",
