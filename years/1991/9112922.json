 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colucci proposes to study the accuracy of extended (30-day)                forecasts by a numerical model, and to identify those dynamical                 characteristics of initial and evolving states that distiguish                  between periods in which the model exhibits low skill, from those               with high skill, and those in which forecast skill changes drasti-              cally with minor variations in the initially defined state. The                 technique to be used is \"case compositing\", in which the climato-               logical record is subdivided according to some objective measure of             the relevant property (in this case, forecast skill) and composite              patterns are constructed for each of the subcategories. Success is              shown by finding physically meaningful and interpretable differ-                ences between the composites, which may then be used to identify                specific model deficiencies. It is highly dependent on the meteor-              ological and climatological insights of the practitioner. Colucci's             past accomplishments under prior NSF support show that he is well               qualified in this respect. The study will contribute to one object-             ive of the US Global Change Research Program, viz., an operational              numerical forecast model for seasonal climate to be implemented                 during the 1996-2000 period. Such a model will serve as a stepping              stone to subsequent models predicting multi-annual climate changes              (induced by natural and/or man-made causes) with sufficient credi-              bility to serve as useful guides in the framing of resource-                    management policy within the private, national, and international               sectors.",
