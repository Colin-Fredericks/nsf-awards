 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the dynamics of the                         equatorial upper atmosphere and the ionosphere.  The 50 km to                   1000 km altitude region of the atmosphere will be probed using a                very high frequency (VHF) radar at the Jicamarca Radio                          Observatory near Lima, Peru. This facility, operated by the                     Geophysical Institute of Peru with support form the National                    Science Foundation, is the largest atmospheric VHF radar                        facility in existence, and the only instrument in its class                     located at equatorial latitudes.  Studies will focus on                         ionospheric plasma instabilities (processes which disturb the                   equilibrium distribution of the ionized component of the upper                  atmosphere  above roughly 100 km altitude), and on measurements                 of winds, atmospheric waves and turbulence in the 50 to 100                     kilometer region.  The shapes of plasma irregularities along and                perpendicular to the geomagnetic field direction will be measured               using interferometric radar imaging techniques which make use of                multiple receiving antennas; such measurements will aid in                      developing models of plasma instability evolution. Time                         resolution  will be sufficient to  measure the drift velocity and               temporal evolution of  plasma structures in a field of view of                  approximately 7 degrees (about 12 km horizontal distance at 100                 km altitude).  Measurements in the 50 to 100 km region will be                  aimed at the interactions between wind, wave, and turbulence                    processes, and the altitude distribution of turbulence strength.                Various radar techniques suitable for such measurements will also               be improved and compared.",
