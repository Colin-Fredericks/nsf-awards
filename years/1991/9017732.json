 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation is both experimental and theoretical.  The                   objectives of the proposed research are as follows:  (1) to                     develop a complete general solution for viscous laminar and                     turbulent flows in helicoidal pipes;  (11) to obtain the                        complete general solution of convective heat transfer for                       laminar and turbulent flows in helicoidal pipes and;  (iii) to                  repeat (i) and (ii) experimentally.  The specific objectives                    ar to obtain the flow fields and thermal properties in the                      listed cases for which rigorous analytical/numerical or                         experimental results are not available, and to present                          correlations, tables, and graphs for use in industrial                          application.  It is believed that the availability of accurate                  analytical, numerical and experimental results for these                        fundamental problems are important from academic and practical                  points of view and they will further enhance the research in                    this area.  The governing equations are non-linear.  These                      equation, by using the method of perturbation for laminar flow                  will be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations.                    By the use of numerical methods, an algorithm will be                           developed for the evaluation of these equations.  The modified                  K-. Turbulent Model will be used to solve the governing                         equations.  For part (iii), an experimental set-up will be                      designed and used to obtain experimentally the fluid flow                       using laser doppler anemometry (LDA) and temperature field                      using data acquisition.  Experimental findings will be                          compared with the results of theoretical/numerical analysis to                  check the validity of basic assumptions and of various models                   available in literature.",
