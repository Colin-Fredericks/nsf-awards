 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the engineering design process, the decisions pertaining                to the topology of the system are in general, based on intuition                and experience.  Once the topology has been selected, the                       dimensional variables of the system are sized and optimized for the             selected topology.  This, however, may not provide the best                     solution since other competing topologies have already been                     rejected based on intuition.  This research plans to incorporate                topological decisions in the framework of design optimization.                  This will be done by using 0-1 design variables to represent                    topological decisions involving a choice between alternative                    designs.  Another related problem which will be addressed in this               research deals with the support of multidisciplinary considerations             in the design process.  This will be accomplished through a use of              multiple objective functions in the problem formulation.                             This research will furnish a design tool which can be utilized             to (i) generate and evaluate the feasibility and relative merit of              alternative design concepts, (ii) help develop detailed optimum                 designs for promising concepts, and (iii) will provide an impetus               for the development of better computer-aided design tools and                   optimization methodologies to help support preliminary and detailed             design activities.",
