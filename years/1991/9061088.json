 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of perovskites such as BaTiO3 as thin film ferroelectric                materials in microelectronics and photonics has been limited by                 materials processing and compatibility problems.  High quality                  ferroelectric thin films have not been grown at temperatures                    compatible with stand Si or GaAs processing technology.                         Considering the superb electrical and optical properties of these               materials as well as their potential for use in the production of               low cost DRAMs and non-volatile memory devices, the development                 of new thin film deposition techniques capable of producing high                quality ferroelectric thin films at low temperatures is                         especially important.  Utilizing techniques recently developed at               ATM for the deposition of high temperature superconductors by                   metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), a novel plasma-                 enhanced MOCVD process for the deposition of BaTiO3 at                          temperatures compatible with silicon processing is proposed.  The               specific goal of the Phase I program is to deposit a-axis                       oriented BaTi03 thin films on Si(100) at temperatures below 650oC               by plasma enhanced MOCVD.  Prototype random access memory devices               based on BaTiO3 ferroelectric capacitor storage cells will be                   fabricated and tested in Phase II.  Lifetimes in excess of 1012                 write/read/invert accesses and power-off memory retention over                  one year, which represent a significant improvement over state-                 of-the-art ferroelectric memory cells, are targeted.",
