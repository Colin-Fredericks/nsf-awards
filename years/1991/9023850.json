 "awd_abstract_narration": "Isolated conspecific populations of organisms come to encompass                 unique genetic allele complexes through processes such as local                 adaptation, random drift and mutation.  When these populations                  are brought together in the laboratory the hybrid organisms                     often exhibit reduced fitness (ie. hybrid breakdown).  Though                   hybrid breakdown has been a long standing observation in biology,               little progress has been made in understanding the genetic                      mechanisms which underlie the processes. This project will                      investigate, on a genetic and molecular level, hybrid breakdown                 between naturally occurring populations of the intertidal copepod               Tigriopus californicus.                                                                                                                                         Like most marine crustacea and many other marine invertebrates,                 T. californicus adjusts the levels of free amino acids (FAA) in                 response to salinity changes.  Specifically, proline synthesis                  from glutamate is induced by hyperosmotic stress.                               Interpopulation crosses yield F2 hybrids which are unable to                    accumulate proline in response to hyperosmotic stress (though                   parental and F1 hybrids can).  Using heterologous probes and/or                 functional complementation in Escherichia coli auxotrophs the                   genes involved in proline synthesis in T. californicus will be                  isolated and characterized.  These genes will then be used to                   examine the molecular and genetic mechanisms which underlie                     hybrid breakdown in response to hyperosmotic stress.",
