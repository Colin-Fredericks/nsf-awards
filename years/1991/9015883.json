 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phytoplankton play a central role in biogeochemical cycles.                     Simply measuring biomass and production is not sufficient; a                    detailed assessment of the community structure is necessary to                  elucidate the population dynamics, annual variability and                       responses to short-term physical events.  The objectives of this                project are: (1) to determine the composition of the                            phytoplankton community at the GOFS Hawaii Ocean Time-series                    station, (2) to estimate the contribution of the different algal                populations to the total biomass, and (3) to understand depth                   distribution and temporal patterns and to elucidate annual                      variability.                                                                                                                                                    In order to characterize and quantify the different populations                 of cells of the phytoplankton community a number of different                   techniques will be employed.  Flow cytometry will allow rapid                   discrimination of different groups such as eukaryotic                           picoplankton, Synechococcus - cyanobacteria, and the newly                      discovered prochlorophytes.  It will provide an efficient and                   quantitative way to measure cell concentration and to quantitate                pigment fluorescence and scatter signature on a single-cell                     basis.  Immunofluorescence techniques, using antibodies                         specifically targeted at prokaryotic (Synechococcus) and                        eukaryotic (e.g. prasinophytes, coccolithophorids) groups and                   pigment analyses (by HPLC and spectrofluorometry) will permit                   further refinement of the taxonomic composition of the community.               The latter will be specifically helpful for the smaller                         eukaryotes and for the prochlorophyte component which has a                     unique divinyl-chlorophyll signature and which is believed to be                very important in oligotrophic waters.                                                                                                                          This project will provide the first detailed time-series data on                the structure of the phytoplankton community in the central                     Pacific gyre.  The results will complement the core measurements                made at station ALOHA by adding a quantitative analysis of the                  primary producer community, which will serve as a basis for                     future realistic modeling efforts.  Contrasting our findings with               a parallel project to be conducted by S.W. Chisholm and R.J.                    Olson (MIT/WHOI) at the GOFS Bermuda site, where phytoplankton                  exhibits pronounced seasonal variability, will reinforce the                    value of both studies.",
