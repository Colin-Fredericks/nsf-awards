Luebbers, Department of Electrical                         Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park,                    to Japan for a cooperative research project with Professor                      Saburo Adachi, Laboratory of Electromagnetics at Tohoku                         University, at Sendai.  The researchers will attempt to                         extend the applications and analysis capabilities of Finite                     Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods as applied to problems                    in electromagnetics.  The FDTD method involves dividing a                       computational space into small cells.  The material occupying                   each cell may be specified independently.  The simulated                        electromagnetic source field is propagated through the                          computational space in small time steps.  The electric and                      magnetic fields in each cell are computed at each time step.                    Other quantities, including voltage, current, Pointing                          vector, and energy density are available for each cell at                       each time step.  The areas of concentration will include                        development of an FDTD antenna modeling capability, assessing                   effectiveness of methods used to shield persons and electronic                  equipment from electromagnetic waves, improving methods for                     analyzing dispersive electric and magnetic materials such as                    plasmas, and developing improved methods for modeling and                       predicting biological effects of electromagnetic fields.                                                                                                        The Laboratory of Electromagnetics at Tohoku University is                      one of the most highly recognized and prestigious electromag-                   netics research institutions in Japan.  Professor Adachi is                     internationally recognized as a leader in electromagnetics                      research.  Professor Luebbers has been heavily involved in                      the area and contributed to the development of FDTD modeling                    of dispersive media.  Applications for these improved FDTD                      methods include antennas, radar scattering, electromagnetic                     performance of dielectric and magnetic materials, electromag-                   netic shielding, microwave circuits, fiber optics, and                          biological effects.  Since there is an agreement of Academic                    Exchange between the Pennsylvania State University and Tohoku                   University, it is believed that collaboration between the                       researchers will continue beyond the termination of this                        formal agreement.",
