 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will provide training over a three-year period                    to enhance the teaching capabilities of two different groups                    of teachers, one with a background in science, and the other                    with a background in the education of mildly handicapped                        children. The participants are middle school/junior high                        certified teachers of science or special education who teach                    science to children classified as learning disabled or                          emotionally disturbed.                                                                                                                                          The project includes two waves of 24 trainees for three                         years in a summer program with follow-up sessions during the                    academic year.  Approximately 60% of the sessions are                           devoted to content and the remainder to teaching methods and                    clinical experiences with handicapped children.                                                                                                                 In summary, the project has potential for increasing the                        teaching effectiveness of middle school/junior high teachers                    in science to children with learning disabilities.                                                                                                              Cost sharing equals 11% of the NSF award.",
