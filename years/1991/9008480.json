 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dramatic changes that have characterized the world's economic          system in recent decades have been fueled, in part, by significant              changes in the flows of capital across international boundaries.                Foreign investment in a number of forms has increased substantially.            One of the most important types of foreign investment has been the use          of venture capital to spur the development of new high technology-              related activities.  Geographers and other social scientists have               described the uneven spatial distribution of venture capital flows, and         they have identified many factors that seem to affect the pattern and           magnitude of these flows.  This project will provide a more detailed            analysis of investment funds in the United States and the United                Kingdom in order to expand knowledge about the processes, links, flows,         and outcomes of international venture capital activities originating in         these two nations.  Working collaboratively with a British geographer,          the American investigator will interview fund managers to identify              international investors and obtain more detailed descriptions of their          decision-making processes.  Data about venture capital flows also will          be examined using discriminant analysis to highlight underlying                 influences on capital flows.                                                         This project will provide a comparative test of basic models of            venture capital flows and will add to basic knowledge about the spatial         choreography of international venture-capital activity and the changes          to start-up investment processes that occur when operations move to an          international level.  The specific data gathered in this project also           will become a basis for these and other investigators to later test             other hypotheses and models about international capital movements.",
