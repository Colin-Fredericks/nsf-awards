 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This proposal supports the collaboration of                       Drs. J.F. Scott and L. Kazmersky of the University of                           Colorado at Boulder, Dr. R. Bitar, University of Jordan,                        Amman, Jordan and Dr. A. Shawabkah, Birzeit University, West                    Bank, Palestine.  The purpose of the collaboration is to                        produce true device equations for ferroelectric film                            memories.  Project funding will help support Dr. Bitar                          during his sabbatical stay at the University of Colorado as                     well as allow Dr. Scott to travel to Dr. Bitar's home                           institution.  Existing facilities in Jordan are capable of                      carrying out this research, therefore, when Dr. Bitar                           returns to Jordan, studies can continue.                                                                                                                        Scope:  The proposed collaboration will bring together                          research scientists from the U.S. and Jordan (Dr. Shawabkah                     is a Jordanian citizen as well as Dr. Bitar) working in the                     area of ferroelectric thin films.  It is anticipated that                       this collaborative research will result in the development                      of ferroelectric thin film memories.  Dr. Bitar will have an                    opportunity to familiarize himself with the techniques                          utilized by the team at the University of Colorado and then                     transfer this technology to facilities at his home                              institution.  Therefore, this proposal fulfils objectives of                    the Science in Developing Countries Program in its exchange                     and transfer of scientific knowledge through an                                 international collaboration.",
