 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to construct a multi-purpose                  facility which allows instructions in computerized measurement                  techniques through fundamental experiments in fluid mechanics.                  The facility is a water channel whose design allows for the study               of external flows such as the flow around bluff bodies and                      familiar airplane shapes.  The design also allows study of                      internal flows such as diffusers and nozzles through the                        insertion of false walls.  Two measurement systems will be                      initially used on the channel: hotfilm anemometry and laser                     doppler anemometry.  Both of these systems will incorporate                     computer-controlled data acquisition and reduction.  The selected               computer system uses symbolic programming in a language which is                both powerful in application and simple to learn.  This                         facilitates simple modification of both the acquisition and                     reduction modules by the students so that they may design their                 own experiments and easily adapt the classroom experiments.",
