This                  proposal examines this issue for lotic invertebrates which are                  known to rapidly recover from floods but for which the recovery                                                                                                 mechanisms are not known.  The PI will test the general                         hypothesis that mitigating patches, namely debris dams, lessen                  the detrimental effect of floods on stream meiofauna by reducing                                                                                                                                                                                faunal displacement during floods and by facilitating return of                                                                                                 displaced fauna to the stream bottom following flood.                           Experimental tests of specific hypotheses are outlined to address                                                                                                                                                                               both the magnitude of the effect that these mitigating patches                  have on the fauna and the mechanisms underlying the effects.                    Experiments will involve: (1) field quantification of how the                   spatial patterns of the fauna are effected by the proposed                      mitigating patches and by flood; (2) field experiments in which                                                                                                 patches are manipulated and recovery of fauna compared with                                                                                                     unmanipulated sites; and (3) field and flume studies examining                                                                                                  the mechanisms responsible for faunal response to mitigating                                                                                                    patches.  The results will provide information on how  natural                                                                                                  disturbances effect equilibrium conditions.",
