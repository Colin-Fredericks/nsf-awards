 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decomposition can be thought of as a continuous process beginning               with fresh plant litter and leading to formation of increasingly                refractory organic matter.  This refractory material in turn                    influences nutrient availability, production, and carbon                        sequestration in ecosystems.  At present, only early stages of the              decomposition process have been intensively researched.  The few                long-term data available indicate the decomposition process begins              with an initial rapid loss of labile litter constituents and                    becomes progressively slower as more recalcitrant compounds compose             an increasingly large fraction of the remaining material.  This                 continuum can be divided into two phases: the first phase is                    characterized by a relatively rapid loss of mass, immobilization                of nutrients, and a rapidly declining overall decomposition rate;               the second phase is characterized by uniformly slow decomposition               rates and is accompanied by nutrient mineralization.  Transition                between these two phases appears to occur when the lignocellulose               index reaches 0.5.  A team of scientists, LIDET (Long-term                      Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team), has started a set of                  experiments to test whether these general relationships are                     consistent across a wide range of macroclimates and substrate                   qualities.  These long-term experiments involve 17 LTER and 4 other             cooperating sites, and a total of 31 types of litter.  Experiments              are designed to follow changes in mass, carbon fractions, and total             nitrogen and phosphorus for up to 10 years.  This newly funded                  component of the study supports the addition of 7 new sites to                  represent conditions that are not yet covered.  It also supports                the chemical characterization of changes in litter as it decomposes             and testing of four decomposition models (CENTURY, GEM, GENDEC, and             VEGIE) to predict long term dynamics across the full suite of 28                sites.  The analysis and modeling exercise will assess the ability              of models to predict the amount of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus             during the second phase of litter decomposition, as well as the                 timing of transition between the initial phase of constant mass                 loss and the final phase of very slow mass loss. The LIDET team of              twenty-eight scientists is coordinated through the electronic mail              network established under LTER to foster intersite communication.               This outstanding research team is coordinated by Drs.Harmon,                    Melillo, Moorhead, Parton, Rastetter and Aber.",
