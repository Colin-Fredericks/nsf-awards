 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to create an environment conducive to inquiry and                      exploration, a microcomputer assisted laboratory-classroom                      setting is being established.  Learning physical concepts,                      principles, and methods of scientific inquiry is enhanced                       through integration of laboratory activities, discussions, and                  lectures in an atmosphere of guided, interactive inquiry.  This                 innovative approach is greatly facilitated with the assistance                  of microcomputer interfaced instrumentation, which allows rapid                 collection, display, and analysis of data.  Spreadsheet and                     graphics applications are learned and used frequently.  As                      methods and tools of investigation become more familiar,                        student initiated inquiry and student designed experiments                      should arise naturally.  Computer simulations and tutorials are                 used where appropriate.  This microcomputer-based, workshop-                    style course will impact introductory physics courses at three                  levels, affecting students ranging in backgrounds from science                  and engineering to arts and humanities.  Increased                              understanding and appreciation of the process of scientific                     investigation, improved attitudes towards learning physics, and                 greater interest in pursuing careers in science, engineering,                   and science education should result from this project.",
