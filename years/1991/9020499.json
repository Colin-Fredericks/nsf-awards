 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aims of this proposal are to employ biochemical and                         biophysical methods to further characterize a class of                          cofactor-containing enzymes called quinoproteins.   The                         research will focus on the mammalian quinoproteins, plasma                      monoamine oxidase, kidney diamine oxidase and lysyl oxidase.                    All of these enzymes had been thought to contain the bacterial                  cofactor, pyrroloquinoline quinone, PQQ, but this conclusion                    is now in doubt.  The objectives of this proposal are 1) to                     characterize the active site cofactor-containing peptides of                    diamine oxidase and lysyl oxidase.  It is possible that these                   enzymes have the same cofactor as plasma monoamine oxidase,                     i.e., 6-hydroxydopa; 2) to clone the genes and develop an                       expression system for plasma monoamine oxidase and kidney                       diamine oxidase; 3) to characterize the proximity of the Cu2+                   and cofactor sites of all three enzymes using a variety of                      biophysical methods; and 4) to initiate an investigation of the                 biosynthetic origin of 6-hydroxydopa.  These studies will                       provide a clear understanding  of the mechanistic and                           structural features of these metalloquinoproteins and lead to                   a consensus concerning the nature of the carbonyl cofactor in                   quinoproteins of mammalian origin.",
