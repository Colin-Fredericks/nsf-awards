 "awd_abstract_narration": "The loss of variety as well as the numbers of organisms in                 natural habitats is occurring at a rapid pace due to human                      intervention.  It has become crucial to monitor habitat destruction             by more than visual observation.  One possibility for early                     detection of ecosystem degradation is to monitor changes in                     diversity of nematode populations.                                                   Nematodes are ubiquitous in all ecosystems and are a major                 component of the food web in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats.             Previous research on the structure and function of nematode                     communities in global ecosystems has shown that they are of                     ecological significance in soil systems.  Soil nematodes are                    generally classified into five feeding groups: plant feeders,                   bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores and predators.  More recently,              the bacterial feeders have been considered as indicators of                     pollution in both aquatic and terrestrial systems.  There are very              few estimates of the numbers of species of bacterial feeding                    nematodes in various habitats.  Species determinations become                   crucial as ecosystems are examined for stability/change in                      functioning due to the importance of bacterial feeding nematodes                in soil, there has been limited taxonomic research directed at this             group.  One of the difficulties in species determinations is that               most nematodes are transparent, microscopic, and require special                techniques in handling in order to discern minute taxonomic                     characters, a process that is extremely laborious.                                   A different, exploratory approach is proposed for examining                the species diversity of bacterial feeding nematodes.  Two methods              will be used: 1) traditional morphological analyses, and 2)                     recently developed molecular biological techniques.  It is                      anticipated that these techniques will allow for the rapid                      determination of biodiversity within a nematode population as well              as delimitation of species isolates.  These techniques should                   eventually allow the enumeration of species and determination of                the loss of diversity within nematode populations from endangered               habitats.",
