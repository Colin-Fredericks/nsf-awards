 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will investigate erbium-doped fiber                                  amplifiers (EDFAs), already recognized as                                       having changed the course of fiber optics                                       research recently.  EDFAs have emerged as the                                   undisputed champion lightwave communications,                                   and many experts believe that EDFAs will                                        revolutionize long-distance optical                                             communications, from video distribution to                                      broadband networking.  A new era has indeed                                     dawned upon the fiber optics community.                                         The work done will consolidate, and develop                                     further, the work already done under a NSF-                                     SGER award, in which a comprehensive                                            theoretical computer model was developed.  the                                  model can predict the performance of any type                                   of EDFA very accurately, as evidenced by the                                    excellent agreement with published experimental                                 results.  Both theoretical and experimental                                     research work will be done and shall                                            concentrate on pumping in the 800 nm region.                                    This is aimed at the eventual realization of low                                cost, very reliable, performance optimized and                                  compact EDFA modules for use as power                                           amplifiers, line repeaters and preamplifiers in a                               variety of application in lightwave technology.                                 EDFAs offer the exciting possibility of                                         developing completely transparent networks.                                     The shall also investigate theoretically amplifiers                             for the 1300 nm region with neodymium doped                                     fluoride glass, by considering optimized fiber                                  design and different pumping configurations.",
