 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current theories emphasize that perceivers rely heavily on their                general knowledge in making judgments about specific people.  For               example, stereotyping is thought to involve the application of                  general knowledge about characteristics of a social group as the                perceiver makes judgments or forms expectations about an                        individual who is a member of that group.  However, this                        perspective requires additional assumptions to account for                      observations, and does not account for perceivers' judgments                    about an individual who is a member of two or more distinct                     groups about whom stereotypes exist (e.g., a female Marine).                    This proposal outlines four laboratory experiments and computer                 simulations to develop and test a new theory of social judgment.                This theory holds that perceivers flexibly access and apply their               knowledge about specific persons--in addition to their general                  knowledge--to make judgments about other people.  The use of such               exemplar information depends on aspects of the perceiver's goals,               past experiences, and group memberships as well as the current                  social situation.  This theory promises to shed new light on                    previously problematic aspects of the stereotyping processes, and               suggests a new set of directions for research on person                         perception and social judgment in general.",
