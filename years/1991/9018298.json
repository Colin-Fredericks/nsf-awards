 "awd_abstract_narration": "The photosynthetic ultraphytoplankton dominate ocean systems,              both in terms of primary productivity and biomass, especially in                stratified waters.  However, the eukaryotic ultraplankton are only              poorly known.  This lack of basic information probably results from             their small size, fragility, and resistance to culturing efforts.               General studies of pigments in diverse oceanic systems reveal                   several abundant pigments which undoubtedly are from the eukaryotic             ultraplankton and they undoubtedly will be of utility in                        classifying and identifying the taxa.  However, there has been no               systematic attempt to correlate these pigments with the taxa---a                result of lack of species definition.  It is unclear whether the                few recorded instances are characteristic of the oligotrophic                   systems.  The PIs propose to characterize oceanic ultraplankton                 populations through the seasons and at a variety of stations in the             Atlantic and Pacific oceans.  They will use ultrastructural                     analyses of cultured specimens to provide reference materials and               correlate those morphological entities with their pigment-                      signatures.  The resultant information will provide valuable                    information for studies on distribution, physiological ecology, and             systematics of the oceanic ultraphytoplankton.",
