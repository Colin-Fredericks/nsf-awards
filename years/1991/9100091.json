Buried lifelines which include water, sewer,                                    gas and oil pipelines have been damaged                                         heavily by earthquakes including the 1985                                       Mexico City Earthquake, the 1987 Whittier,                                      California Earthquake and the most recent                                       Loma Prieta Earthquake of October 17, 1989.                                     Existing buried lifelines are unsafe even                                       under moderate earthquakes.  Because of the                                     importance of lifelines to the health,                                          supply, and safety of the public, lifeline                                      earthquake engineering needs greater                                            attention.                                                                                                                                                      Since there is still no codified seismic                                        provision to design buried lifelines, most                                      water and sewer pipelines, including                                            relatively new ones, have been built with                                       minimum earthquake protection.  Damages to                                      water and sewer pipelines during earthquakes                                    are unavoidable and economical loss can be                                      substantial.  Effective repair methods under                                    emergency situations and for a permanent                                        basis are to be addressed by this project.                                      Due to the fact that the replacement of all                                     existing water and sewer pipelines is very                                      expensive, if not impossible, the development                                   of effective rehabilitation techniques and                                      strategies to be developed by the proposed                                      research is urgently needed.",
