 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Proposal requests partial funding for a vertical bore,                     intermediate field NMR spectrometer for high resolution                         spectroscopy in structural biology.  The instrument will consist                of a 7.05 T magnet, sufficient homogeneous volume for 10 mm                     proton and 20 mm heteronuclei sample tubes, and a console with                  all features necessary for advanced techniques such as proton                   detection of heteronuclei, spin locking, multiple quantum                       experiments, and all other modern two dimensional methods.                                                                                                      The spectrometer will be utilized by a core group of five Major                 User (four with NSF funding) and several minor users.  The                      projects of the Major Users focus on NMR applications to                        structural biology.   Planned research using the proposed                       spectrometer emphasizes studies of biomolecule structure and                    model compounds of protein active sites, primarily on systems                   containing paramagnetic metal centers.  Each investigator has an                established program of NMR research with spectrometers of lesser                capability, and the Proposal documents the additional knowledge                 to be gained by the new capabilities of the proposed instrument.                                                                                                The proposed instrument will come under the auspices of the UC                  Davis NMR Facility.  The Facility has a proven record of over ten               years in implementing state-of-the-art NMR techniques, and in                   spectrometer maintenance and modification.",
