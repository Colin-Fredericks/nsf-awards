 "awd_abstract_narration": "The doctoral student is Michael N. Keas.  His topic is \"The                     Structure and Philosophy of Group Research:  A. W. Hofmann's                    Research Program in London and Berlin.\"                                                                                                                         As a teacher, experimentalist, and organizer of science, August                 Wilhelm von Hofmann (1818-1892) made an important contribution to               both British and German chemistry.  He improved the laboratory                  research and instructional methods developed by Justus Liebig in                Giessen and pondered their epistemological assumptions long after               Liebig had retreated to agricultural chemistry.  Hofmann became                 the first professor of the British Royal College of Chemistry in                1845 and continued his teaching and research in London until 1865               when he accepted an invitation to direct the chemistry program at               the University of Berlin.  A number of his students and assistants              became prominent chemists in England and Germany.  Under this grant             for doctoral dissertation research support,  Mr. Keas aims to                   analyze the composition, organization, and methodology of A. W.                 Hofmann's laboratory research group and to explain how these                    factors guided the group's choice and solution of research                      problems.  his approach combines tools of social and intellectual               history.  He hopes to show how the composition and organization of              the research group interacted both in harmonious and in conflicting             ways with Hofmann's academic goals and scientific presuppositions               to carry out a body of group research achievements.",
