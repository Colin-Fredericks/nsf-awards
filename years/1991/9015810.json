 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Philip N.                            Hineline, Professor of Psychology, Temple University, to                        pursue with Dr. F. G. David, Professor of Psychology,                           University of the Philippines, for a period of 24 months, a                     program of cooperative research on choice in situations of                      uncertain or diminishing returns.  The proposed research                        grant will enable Dr. David to continue his involvement in a                    research project in the psychology laboratories of Temple                       University.  Professor David has been integrally involved                       in the formative stages of that project during a one-year                       post-doctoral fellowship supplemented by an additional year                     via sabbatical leave.  The continuing participation would                       entail two summer periods at Temple University, during 1991                     and 1992, and communications via electronic mail concerning                     data analyses and manuscript preparations during the                            intervening and subsequent periods.  The research concerns                      pigeons' choices between differently distributed food                           deliveries:  One set of experiments addresses a prediction                      of optimal foraging theory, that birds become risk-prone                        under negative energy budgets.  Other experiments concern                       pigeons' sensitivities to, and preferences among, differing                     forms of variability in food delivery, and a third set                          concerns choices between fixed vs. escalating work require-                     ments for food delivery.  These last procedures mimic the                       depleting patches of a foraging situation, so its results                       will be relevant to foraging theory; it is of special                           interest because advantageous short-term choices are                            disadvantageous in the longer term.                                                                                                                             This project is relevant to the objectives of the Science in                    Developing Countries Program which seeks to increase the                        level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers                      and their counterparts in developing countries through the                      exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                          techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                      benefit.",
