The three central activities of the                    project are:  (1) providing the opportunity for 80 elementary                   school teachers per year in the Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts             to \"shadow\" practicing scientists in the private sector for 90                  hours, following which they will jointly develop a science activity             for the classroom; (2) establishing electronic networks that will               permit electronic mail communication among the teachers'                        classrooms, industry scientists' laboratories, and possibly college             and university laboratories; (3) conducting bimonthly                           teleconference among the teachers and their mentors to share                    experiences and ideas.  In the course of negotiations the project's             duration became 4 years, the number of teachers affected became                 160, and the private sector's contributions more than doubled.",
