However, communication lifelines, including                                     those used for emergency governmental                                           communications, are themselves vulnerable.                                      There is, therefore, a need to develop a                                        capability to project the extent, duration,                                     and failure modes of telecommunication                                          lifelines service outages for two purposes:                                     1) to estimate the potential magnitude of the                                   communications problem that can be                                              anticipated in the aftermath of major                                           earthquakes, and 2) to identify measures or                                     system enhancements for preventing or                                           mitigating those problems.

The primary purpose                                   of the Workshop is to exchange ideas and                                        thereby stimulate improved approaches to                                        projecting, and ultimately reducing,                                            communication lifeline damage and service                                       outages from major earthquakes.
