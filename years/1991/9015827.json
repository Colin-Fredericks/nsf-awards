 "awd_abstract_narration": "The heavy metal composition of the central nuclear Bulge of our                 Milky Way Galaxy is important to studies of the types of stars                  constituting both external galaxies and the first generation of                 stars in the disk of our Galaxy.  Currently star formation is                   thought to proceed more rapidly in the Bulge than in the                        neighborhood of the Sun.  A point of controversy over the last                  twenty years has been the question of whether strong absorption                 lines in the spectra of red giant stars actually reflect an                     enhanced abundance of heavy elements, or whether they perhaps arise             as a consequence of anomalies in the structures of the atmospheres              of these stars.  The Principal Investigator (PI) wishes to conduct              research in this area by measuring the abundance of the heavy metal             elements in a selected group of Bulge red giants.  This study will              differ from those of the past in that high dispersion spectra will              be obtained with modern solid state arrays to conduct the abundance             analysis.  The results will be used to estimate the mass                        distribution of supernovae which return nuclear-processed material              into the interstellar medium.  A secondary project will be to                   determine whether carbon-star giants (the origin of which is                    likewise unclear) in the Bulge have enhanced metal abundances                   relative to the Sun's composition.",
