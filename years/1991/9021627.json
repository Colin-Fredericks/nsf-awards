 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is centered about development and exploitation               of \"mapping closure\", a novel and powerful method for statistical               modeling of the properties of turbulent flow fields. Mapping                    closure is based on the continuous distortion of fields with                    known statistics into approximations of flows developing                        according to known physical-dynamic laws. It has several advan-                 tages over traditional analytical approaches, particularly with                 regard to the prediction of the statistical properties of such                  fields, including entire probability distribution functions                     (pdf's). It can give meaningful estimates of improbable events,                 and since it can track structures in physical space it may lead                 to more realistic subgrid-scale representations. It is proposed                 that the method be applied to pdf's of 2-dimensional turbulence                 and of fields governed by quasi-geostrophic dynamics. The pro-                  posed work also encompasses the investigation of practical                      procedures for the calculations required; the publication of a                  pedagogically oriented paper to make the method's associated                    tools more widely available to the geosciences community; and the               evaluation of its applicablity to subgrid representations.                           Although the first two applications of the method are of                   particular relevance to large-scale meteorology and oceanography,               Kraichnan's work on the method has been closely followed by                     scientists in other disciplines. They have recognized that it                   can be applied to the large percentage of the fluid in the                      universe that is in turbulent motion in systems of all scales.                  These include those undergoing non-linear chemical reactions (as                in combustion models), those used in mechanical engineering, and                those considered in planetary science and in astrophysics.",
