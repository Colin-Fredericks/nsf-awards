 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polyrotaxanes, comprised of macrocyclic rings threaded by linear                macromolecules, are a new and still unexploited family of polymers.             Due to the potential for the macrocyclic components to move                     lateraly along the linear backbone as well as circumferentially,                these systems are expected to possess properties distinct from                  those of traditional covalently bonded polymeric materials or                   blends thereof.                                                                                                                                                 The synthesis and characterization of a wide variety of structural              types of polyrotaxanes will be carried out.  Synthesis by                       statistical threading of macrocycles by linear monomers will rely               on use of the cyclic as the solvent for the polymerization.  A                  directed method is based on an attractive force between the                     macrocycle and the linear monomer, forming a stable threaded entity             (a rotaxane) prior to polymerization.  Stability against loss of                the macrocycles by diffusion is ensured by incorporation of large               end caps or bulky spacers along the backbone.  Various combinations             of the two components, over a range of polarity, will be                        considered.  Among the macrocycles are both rigid and flexible                  crown ethers, hydrocarbons, and quaternary ammonium systems.                    Linear polymeric components, likewise, will vary widely from                    flexible to rigid-rod structures, formed by both step and chain-                growth methods.                                                                                                                                                 The overall objective is to explore and exploit the novel                       topographic and topological features of this novel polymer                      architecture.  Potential areas of utilization include interfacial               bonding (adhesion, blend compatibilization), improved                           processability (enhanced solubility, lower melting points),                     stabilization (encasement of labile functionality), improved                    control of molecular ordering (electron and energy transport,                   molecular level interpenetrating networks for better mechanical                 performance), and understanding the diffusion of linear                         macromolecules in the bulk.",
