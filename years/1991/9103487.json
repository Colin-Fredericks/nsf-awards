 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of new polymeric materials involves new arrangements of             monomers as much as it does development of new monomers.  Recently,             interest has focused on polymeric surfactants adsorbed on surfaces.             Block copolymers or end-adsorbing polymers have amphiphilic                     character, meaning that they tend to form aggregates or                         microstructures such as micelles, microemulsions, lamellae and                  monolayers.  Chains are tethered in these structures in that they               are attached by their ends.  The aim of this workshop is to bring               together researchers from many countries with experimental and                  theoretical experience in all aspects of tethered polymer chains to             discuss the latest issues and advance the state of understanding of             this important category of polymeric materials.  Proceedings of the             workshop will be published.",
