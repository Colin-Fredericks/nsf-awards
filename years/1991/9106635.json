 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                  and the National Facilities and Instrumentation Program will                    help the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University acquire                 a SQUID based magnetometer.  Among the areas of chemical                        research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the                       following:  (1) investigations of the transition temperatures                   and critical current densities of metal-substituted and oxygen                  doped high-temperature copper oxide superconductors;  (2)                       studies of the effects of metal substitution on the charge                      density wave and superconducting states in transition metal                     dichalcogenide materials; (3)  measurements of radical yields                   and investigations of radical pair interactions in the                          photolysis of ketones on porous solids; and (4) studies of                      magnetism in novel high-spin and chiral organic solids.                                                                                                                                                                                         A magnetometer measures the force a material experiences when                   subjected to a magnetic field gradient.  A paramagnetic                         substance consists of molecular magnetic dipoles which tend to                  orient themselves parallel to the direction of the field.  The                  lining up of the magnetic dipoles is opposed by the thermal                     motion of the particles, and in a paramagnetic substance at                     room temperature only a small fraction of the molecules have                    their magnetic moments aligned with the field.  The measurement                 of the volume magnetic susceptibility is positive for                           paramagnetic substances and negative for diamagnetic                            substances.  The magnetometer is useful in studying high                        temperature superconducting materials, radical yields, and                      research dealing in solid state chemistry.",
