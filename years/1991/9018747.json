 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are a number of intrinsic properties of cratons unified in                their pre-dispersal position in Gondwana.  Exposure of deep                     crustal levels of this supercontinent is an essential precursor                 to continental weathering being vital to the on set and nature of               the continental weathering process itself.  These cratonal                      attributes include: the petrological and imeralogical character                 of the bedrock parent material, its unique thermal history,                     depletion in water and heat-producing elements, uplift, erosion                 and ultimate stability necessary for attainment of a state of                   tectonic quiescence when subjected to intense weathering.  This                 transcontinental belt of deep continental crust exposed as                      graulite-charnockite-anorthosite bodies parallels the Gondwanide                Orogen of Paleozoic and Early Mesozoic plate convergence                        affecting South America, Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica                implicating Gondwana supercontinental scale weathering as the                   appropriate crustal unit of analysis rather than individual                     continental land masses.  The necessity of viewing lateritic                    weathering on a supercontinental scale is further accentuated by                the fact that the classical \"residual\" origin of lateritic                      bauxites is inconsistent with a recent discovery that wind-blown                foreign dust consisting of gibbsite, hematite and goethite also                 bearing a component of resistant detrital minerals derived from                 basement rocks elsewhere (zircon, ilmenite, rutile and monazite)                dominates near surface metal enrichment of bauxites and                         laterites.  By considering the crustal processes preceding                      continental weathering as well as the surficial recycling and                   redistribution of chemically-resistant minerals accessed as a                   direct consequence of the petrology and mineralogy of the deep                  crust, we have formulated a testable model of deep crustal                      weathering systems.  An integrated three-part project is planned                addressing (1) the provenance of chemically-stable detrital                     minerals, especially zircon contaminating the upper portions of                 laterites, (2) age and duration of lateritic weathering in                      combination with correlations of paleo-weathering surfaces in                   Australia, West Africa and Brazil, and (3) mechanisms of                        subsurface transport and incorporation of detritus into the                     lateritic regolith during dilational biomechanical mixing of                    eolian dust by root growth cycles.  Part I utilizes U-Pb ion                    microprobe dating of zircon using the SHRIMP to define the                      sources of mobile minerals and the depths of their translocation                into laterite and bauxite weathering profiles.  Part II involves                40Ar/39Ar laser dating of jarosite as well as manganese and iron                oxides.  Part III is laboratory experimentation using a soil                    mechanics cell capable of simulation root growth cycles.  The                   proposed interdisciplinary research can contribute to further                   development of a much-needed long-term continental record of                    surficial environments to complement the marine stratigraphic                   record of global processes.",
