 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Rancho              Santa Ana Botanical Gardens for the replacement of a seed storage               facility and greenhouses and for the repair and renovation of                   laboratories which house systematic and evolutionary botanical                  research and research training activities.  These buildings were                constructed, respectively, in pre-1950, 1960, and 1969 and none of              them has been renovated to date.  The ARFMP grant of $400,000 and               $400,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to                modernize these research and research training facilities which                 will permit current research and research training programs to                  expand in scope and duration and to encompass an array of                       experimental procedures that it is currently infeasible to use.                 This project will address the need to improve the current research              infrastructure both in terms of health and safety and of the                    quantity, quality, and diversity of research that can be conducted              by providing space for research and research training which is                  adequately heated, cooled, and ventilated and which conforms to                 current building codes.                                                                                                                                         This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of systematic                 and evolutionary botanical research and for the training of                     quality graduate students in a program that plays an important                  role in the research training of minority students, that excels in              its integration of field, greenhouse, laboratory, and herbarium                 research techniques, and that fills an important need in its                    production of well- and broadly-trained plant systematists.",
