 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate students studying control theory have difficulty                  connecting the abstract and fundamental notions presented in the                classroom with the practical reality of what processor system                   their design is to control.  Although students gain facility in                 mathematical analysis, they lack the physical intuition on how to               pose a control problem, how to model the system, how to determine               which types of measurements are necessary and available.  An                    undergraduate control systems laboratory consisting of six                      experimental stations will address this deficiency.  Each station               will include a microcomputer with analog interface boards for                   data acquisition and for implementation of control.  The computer               will be used first in the identification of a suitable model for                the system, then as a design, simulation and display device using               the Matlab CAD package and finally as the actual implementation                 of the control law when interfaced with the physical system.                    Experiments include DC motor control, coupled tanks, and the                    inherently unstable system of balancing a ball on a tiltable                    beam.  The lab will be used in two senior level courses and by                  students who wish to work on control systems for their senior                   design projects.  The wide range of physical phenomena afforded                 by the experiments will give students experience in handling                    different types of problems, from a point that precedes the                     typical textbook setting, through the actual implementation and                 performance.  By requiring the student to model and control a                   physical system, students should gain a better understanding of                 the underlying theory; through there use of the CAD tools, they                 should be able to design better control systems, and be better                  prepared to face the demands of new technologies.",
