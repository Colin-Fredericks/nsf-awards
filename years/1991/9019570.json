 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome bc1                       complex) is among the most highly conserved constituents of                     energy transducing membranes.  Although complexes from                          phylogenetically diverse species are functionally                               interchangeable and their cytochrome c1 cytochrome b and                        iron-sulfur protein components are homologous, isolated                         oxidoreductases differ markedly with respect to additional                      polypeptide constituents.  Mitochondrial complexes contain as                   many as eight additional subunits which are required in the                     enhancement of electron transport and in the assembly                           process.  The cytochrome bc1 complex of Rhodobacter                             sphaeroides contains a tightly bound forth subunit which                        provides sa unique opportunity to elucidate the role of a                       single noncatalytic component.  Partial sequence data will be                   used to construct hybridization probes to facilitate the                        isolation of the subunit IV structural gene for sequence                        comparisons.  Topological analyses in which either the                          cytoplasmic or the periplasmic side of the membrane is                          digested with proteinase K will determine the location of                       subunit IV to assist in elucidating its functional role.                        Electron transfer activity and changes in the EPR signals of                    the iron-sulfur and Qc components will be assessed in the                       purified cytochrome bc1 complex following limited proteolytic                   digestion and after exposure to anti-subunit IV antibodies.                     Mutants in which the structural gene for subunit IV has been                    interrupted by interposon mutagenesis will be constructed and                   the composition and functional properties of the altered                        complex will be examined.  These integrated approaches should                   prove valuable in elucidating important structure-function                      and assembly relationships in the bc1 complex.",
