 "awd_abstract_narration": "As understanding of the biology of these important organisms and                their complex metabolism increases rapidly from year to year, the               need for international gatherings such as those in Geneva and                   Chicago grows also.  A decision was therefore made that a third                 symposium would be held in Trieste, Italy, under the auspices of                the University of Milan in 1991.                                                                                                                                The science of Pseudomonas has reached a maturity that speaks for               itself through the papers presented in the previous meetings.  The              field continues to expand.  Molecular biology is having an impact               on understanding of metabolic biotransformations in Pseudomonas,                its mechanisms of pathogenicity (in both humans and plants), and                its use in the exciting world of biotechnology.  As research                    blossoms into new discoveries, we will continue to enjoy this                   education and human development to further the cause of science and             technology worldwide as well as in the United States.",
