 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gigasample analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are needed in many               fields, from advanced information processing systems to scientific              instrumentation used in high energy Physics experiments.  As higher             speed ADCs become available, signal capture functions which were                only possible in the analog domain, now become possible to achieve              in the digital domain, where sophisticated (and far more accurate)              signal processing functions may be applied.                                                                                                                     Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) technology promises a tenfold increase in               conversion rate in addition to providing overall improvement in                 issues such as power dissipation, radiation resistance, operability             at higher temperature, etc., as compared to silicon technology.                 However, GaAs ADC development has been plagued with problems for                which no near term solution is foreseen.  The thrust of this                    research is in the development of a technology driven architecture              that draws upon the strengths of both GaAs and Si technologies.                 In particular, the research makes use of the significant difference             between the signal bandwith (\"rise time) and realizable current                 gain (or current drive) between the technologies to realize low-                power high resolution ADCs.  The work involves feasibility                      research, modeling and prototype building.",
