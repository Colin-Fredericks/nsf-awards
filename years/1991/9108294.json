 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ROW planning grant is concerned with developing a                          methodology for investigating the effects of help in plan                       selection for experienced programmers learning a new programing                 language.  Programmers learning a new language spend the largest                percentage of their time in planning activities.  A model of                    program development in a new language shows that this activity                  causes much iteration in the developmental process.  This model                 is contrasted with the model of programmers writing a program in                a known language.  This work will study object-oriented and                     declarative languages during the planning period.  After they                   type of planning help needed in different types of languages has                been determined plan templates will be constructed.  Studies                    willthen be designed to determine the effect that these templates               have on program development.",
