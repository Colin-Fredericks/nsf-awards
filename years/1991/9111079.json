 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal outlines two activities both of which are                     aimed at a study of decays of heavy quarks through the weak                     interaction.  The investigator has joined a collaboration in                    an experiment at Fermilab (E791) aimed at the production from                   pion nucleus collisions of large numbers of mesons containing                   the charmed quark.  Her role in this is to study form factors                   in semileptonic decays of these mesons, and also the                            possibility of D0 anti D0 mixing - a phenomenon which has                       already been observed in the strange and bottom quark mesonic                   counterparts.  The PI also proposes to continue her                             involvement in the research and development required in the                     possible evolution of an experiment aimed at a study of CP                      violation in the weak decays of b quarks.  This experiment                      would center about an asymmetric e+e- accelerator facility                      producing large numbers of B mesons known as a B Factory.  She                  is already involved in detector development relevant to the                     use of such a facility, and proposes to continue to evaluate                    Helium gas drift chambers in particular.",
