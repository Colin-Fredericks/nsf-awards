 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds to upgrade our Research Methodology                   Laboratory by replacing the current Apple IIe microcomputers                    with Macintosh LC microcomputers connected to a local area                      network (LAN) Psychology majors in their sophomore year will                    acquire some laboratory experience with data collection and                     data analysis that represent state of the art technology, and                   these \"hands-on\" laboratory experiences will provide pre-                       requisite skills necessary for more advanced courses in                         psychology.  Exposure of the students to up-to-date equipment                   and comtemporary research methods will enhance the quality of                   instruction.  Furthermore, the department will expand its                       undergraduate facility from stand-alone work-stations to a LAN                  with increased memory capacity and access to the campus LAN.                    This project is significant because it will remove the present                  frustration encumbered by both faculty and students who must                    use limited outdated equipment, and it will enable instructors                  to incorporate state of the art demonstrations of psychological                 phenomenon in a number of other psychology courses.",
