The senior capstone experience, independent research                 investigations, Honors research, and selected laboratory                        courses will benefit from SEM capabilities. Our course                          offerings will now include a new course, Introduction to                        Scanning Electron Microscopy.  Problem-solving approaches will                  be emphasized in both student research and classroom/laboratory                 investigations.  The departmental goals which will be advanced                  through SEM capabilities include: 1) the improvement of                         undergraduate education 2) the enhancement of student capstone                  and research experiences, 3) and further development of                         critical thinking, quantitative and analytical skills of                        students.  A critical point drier and a sputter coater with                     vacuum pump, essential for specimen preparation are also                        included in the request.",
