 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the collaborative research of a U.S.                      anthropologist and a Brazilian colleague.  They will study how                  the presentation of two different sets of Brazilian \"racial\"                    terms during census interviews affects the percentage of                        Brazilians who identify themselves as \"non-white\".  They                        hypothesize that changing the term that the Brazilian census uses               to identify people as \"mixed\" (not White or Black) will change                  the proportion of people self-identifying as \"white\", and that                  this change will be affected by socio-economic status.  A split                 census of a small town in Bahia, Brazil will be carried out as a                test.  Controlling for socio-economic status, half the                          respondents will be offered each choice.                                                                                                                        This research is important because Brazil has a complex racial                  culture, in which discrimination against degree of Blackness is                 moderated by fluidity in \"racial\" categories affected by physical               and socio-economic factors.  Understanding the sources of                       discrimination in a society like Brazil can help planners in a                  binary \"racial\" society such as the U.S. moderate the effects of                racism.",
