Instructional modules for a college course in                        physical science will be produced based on materials                            developed by the Operation Physics project.  The course                         will emphasize the teachers' acquiring a better                                 understanding of the physical science concepts they would                       be required to teach, an awareness of both their own and                        children's naive ideas about physical science phenomena,                        and a repertoire of techniques and strategies which they                        can use in their classroom to help children better learn                        and understand physical science concepts.  A group of                           outstanding physics and chemistry educators will contribute                     to the writing and field testing of the materials.  An                          extensive program of college faculty enhancement will be                        undertaken to educate faculty in the best practices of                          teaching physical science and how the materials should be                       used with prospective teachers.  Field test instructors                         will be solicited both through AAPT and ACS publications.                       The cost-sharing will be 24% of NSF's contribution.",
