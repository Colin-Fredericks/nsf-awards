 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ideally in cellular manufacturing systems, a family of parts               will be processed in its entirety within a machine cell that                    consists of one or more machine types.  In most practical                       problems a non-ideal situation prevails, in that the individual                 part and machine groupings are usually connected.  A part might                 require processing in a cell other than its own (called a                       bottleneck part).  Similarly, a machine can process a part                      assigned to a cell other than its own (called a bottleneck                      machine).  Research investigations have been reported to attain                 economies of production, either by duplicating bottleneck                       machines or by subcontracting bottleneck parts.                                      The research takes an integrated approach to develop a                     linear binary programming model for a cellular manufacturing                    system which simultaneously utilizes machine duplication and part               subcontracting to maximize net savings in costs.  As the linear                 model representation has been proven to be NP-hard, a heuristic                 solution algorithm will be developed.  Suitable measures of                     performance have been established to determine the accuracy of                  the solution and the effectiveness of the algorithm.  Given the                 budgetary restriction a parts manufacturing company has to work                 with, the solution algorithm for the model, and the subsequent                  development of hosts of computer programs, will determine the                   bottleneck machines that need to be duplicated and the bottleneck               parts that need to be subcontracted.",
