 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NMDA receptor, a subclass of the neurotransmitter glutamate                 receptors, is widely present at synapses in the vertebrate                      central nervous system.  NMDA receptors have been implicated in                 the process of long term potentiation, a model of learning and                  memory, and synapse formation and stabilization.  The long term                 objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms of                   operation of synaptic ion channels, particulary, the processes of               ligand binding and channel gating.  The immediate goal of the                   research is to examine the activation mechanisms of synaptic                    receptors stimulated by glutamate.  By applying kinetic analyses,               Dr. Auerbach will be able to investigate how agonists, glutamate-               like molecules, activate NMDA ion channels, regulate the gating                 of channel pores and the desensitization of NMDA receptors. In                  addition, the developmental changes in NMDA activated channels                  will be studied.  The Principal investigator has developed a                    method of applying agonist by diffusion through the back of a                   pipette, a powerful technique which will enable the PI to                       obtained data from a single channel over a range of                             concentrations.  Experimentally, this approach will allow for the               study of ligand activated channels in their native cellular                     environment.  Results of this investigation will contribute to                  the understanding of the mechanisms of how the glutamate                        neurotransmitter operates and will provide a microscopic                        description of synaptic transmission.",
