 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Burkhardt and his new co-editor, Dr. Duncan Porter, are                     continuing the preparation of a definitive, thirty volume editon                of the correspondence of Charles Darwin, including approximately                14,300 letters he wrote and received, printed in full,                          authoritative versions, in accordance with modern standards of                  scholarly textual editing.  The letter texts are accompanied by                 clarifying footnotes and transcriptions or description of Darwin's              annotations on letters he received.  Volumes of the Correspondence              are published in chronological order. Each volume is self-                      contained, having its own introduction, bibliography, biographical              notes, and index.  The changes Darwin made as he wrote his letters              are recorded as back matter of the volume.                                                                                                                      Under previous grants, the first seven volumes, including 2,715                 letters of the years 1821 to 1859, have been completed.  Volumes                8 through 14 covering the years 1860 to 1866 will be completed                  under this grant.  This will include 2,819 letters.  These letters              cover the period of critical reaction to the publication of                     Darwin's Origin of Species.  These letters were carefully                       considered and used by Darwin in his revisions of this central work             of the history of biology.",
