 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Halpin is attempting to show how physical theory, and quantum               mechanics in particular, can act as a guide to counterfactual                   logic.  Counterfactuals are statements about what would happen                  if, counter to fact, certain circumstances held.  Included                      amongst counterfactuals are important interpretative statements                 in quantum mechanics about what would result and with what                      probability if a measurement were to be performed.  Over the past               several years, Dr. Halpin has developed various negative                        consequences of physical theory for counterfactual logic.  A                    number of influential counterfactual theories are inadequate, he                has shown, given basic facts of physics.  In contrast and more                  positively, reasoning from the physics also supports a new                      approach to the similarity analysis of counterfactuals.  It is                  this approach and its motivation which Dr. Halpin is examining.                 Much of this research is specific to counterfactuals within the                 quantum mechanical context.  This research includes the                         development of the logic of a probabilistic counterfactual meant                to explicate quantum mechanical probability attribution.",
