 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative reseach between Willam Conner                   of the University of Massachusetts and Mario Chiovetta of                       the Institute of Technology Development for the Chemical                        Industry in Santa Fe, Argentina (INTEC).  This research                         involves a coordinated program of olefin polymerization                         catalysis research and sorption in zeolites to be conducted                     between the University of Massachusetts and INTEC in Argentina.                 The focus of the work is to experimentally determine the                        changes in catalyst morphology and to quantify the changes in                   the thermal and mass transport that occur during the                            polymerization process and sorption within zeolites.  These                     experimentally measured parameters will be used as the basis                    for representing the processes and calculating the dependence                   of the polymer production and of zeolite sorption on the                        process conditions and the changing catalyst morphology.  The                   cooperative program will involve both exchanges of graduate                     (postdoctoral) research assistants and visits between principal                 investigators.                                                                                                                                                  The experimental program and extended characterization will                     primarily be conducted at the University of Massachusetts                       where the reactor systems and instruments for system                            characterization are available.  Specific analyses are also                     to be conducted at Brookhaven National Laboratories (for the                    tomography) and the University of Paris.  Parallel polymer-                     ization reaction studies will be conducted at INTEC in                          Argentina for a stirred bed polymerization system with                          morphological analyses to be primarily conducted at the                         University of Massachusetts.  INTEC will be the main center                     of the modelling and simulation studies for this collaborative                  research.  They will continue their pioneering modelling                        studies of polymerization and develop the parallel analyses                     of zeolitic systems.",
