 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program is made to Dr. Jack Halpern of the Chemistry                            Department, University of Chicago, for studies in the general                   area of kinetics and mechanisms of reactions for organometallic                 compounds.  Five areas of investigation will be pursued:                        asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation reactions; dissociation                      energies of transition metal-alkyl bonds; catalytic properties                  of transition metal polyhydrides; alkyl transfer and                            iron-carbon bond dissociation energies for alkyl iron porphyrin                 compounds; and oxidative addition reactions of Rh and Ir                        metalloporphyrins.  The asymmetric hydrogenation of acrylic                     acid derivatives and transfer hydrogenation reactions will be                   investigated.  Studies on the polyhydrides will include                         reactions involving hydrogen transfer, hydrogenation, and                       reductive elimination.                                                          %%%                                                                             Some catalysts, like enzymes, promote reactions in which not                    only a certain arrangement of atoms is achieved, but only one                   of two possible three-dimensional arrangements.  Understanding                  the mechanism of such \"asymmetric catalysis\" reactions is                       important in order to be able to develop new catalysts which                    can behave with this specificity in a variety of reactions.                     Asymmetric catalysts promise to find broad use in organic                       synthesis, biological modeling studies, and the pharmaceutical                  industry.  Iron porphyrin studies may have relevance to                         reactions of iron-containing enzymes.",
