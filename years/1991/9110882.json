 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project addresses the complexity of algorithms for approximately            solved problems.  In contrast to discrete complexity theory this                investigation deals with problems that are continuous in nature and             which cannot be solved exactly in finite time.  The cost of an                  approximate algorithm depends on its quality (error), and on the form           of its input, which is composed by a number of observations of some             otherwise unknown quantity.                                                                                                                                     The problems to be investigated include the \"average case\" solution of          nonlinear equations, the effects of various kinds of sampling in the            approximation of linear operators, and the development and                      implementation of Monte Carlo-type of algorithms for various classes            of integrands.  The analysis of these problems involves the derivation          of an optimal error algorithm followed by its complexity analysis.              Often, techniques from complexity theory, approximation theory and              results for other similar, or related, problems can be combined to              obtain tight error and complexity estimates.  Nevertheless, in some             cases the only possibility is to modify a known algorithm in order to           obtain another with an improved performance.  The derivation of lower           bounds in usually difficult, and the modifications aim to expose                characteristics of the problems and properties of the algorithms.                                                                                               The problems of interest here and the techniques that will be applied           for their solution are important not only to complexity theory but to           other areas of applied science as well.",
