 "awd_abstract_narration": "Past research by this investigator established a new method for                 analyzing outdoor scenes.  Thermal and visual imagery was                       combined to extract internal object properties that serve as                    physically meaningful features for region labeling.  This new                   research presents an improved formulation of the energy exchange                model used for this purpose.  The energy exchange model is                      formulated as a linear regression model.  Statistically robust                  techniques will be used to extract reliable estimates of internal               object properties such as thermal capacitance.  These techniques                allow reliable estimates in spite of almost 50% of the data being               arbitrarily corrupted due to misregistration of images and                      segmentation errors.  Statistically robust techniques have been                 shown to be beneficial in many important computer vision problems               such as pose estimation, straight-line extraction, computation of               image structure, and surface fitting.  The proposed research will               explore statistical robust approaches to another important                      problem, i.e., sensor fusion.  The computational characteristics                of the robust algorithms will be explored for the chosen sensor                 fusion task.  The new formulation also allows iterative                         refinement of surface parameters (such as thermal emissivity)                   which were assumed known in the previous formulation of the                     model.  The new approach thus improves the accuracy of the                      internal property value estimates and also provides new                         information regarding surface parameter values.  The method thus                provides a greater number of stable features for object                         classification.",
