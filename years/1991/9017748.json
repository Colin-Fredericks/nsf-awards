 "awd_abstract_narration": "The diagenesis of deeply buried quartz arenite sandstones is                    important in the evolution of sedimentary basins, including                     paleohydrology and thermal history and the transition from high                 grade diagenesis to low grade matamorphism.  The primary aim of                 petrographic study will be to measure quantitatively cementation                by quartz and carbonate, pressure solution (geometry of grain                   contacts, timing and extent of chemical compaction), and porosity               loss as a function of pressure, temperature and integrated time-                temperature history.  Samples will be examined by petrographic                  microscopy, cathodo-luminescence and SEM, as well as by some                    chemical and istotopic analyses.  The diagenetic history will be                reconstructed and set in the context of burial and thermal                      history.  Pressure solution will be one of the main focuses,                    especially as it pertains to the transition between the high                    grade diagenesis of deep burial and the low grade metamorphism of               parts of deformed mountain belts.  Sandstones to be sampled                     include the Pennsylvanian of the Green River basin, Pennsylvanian               and Ordovician of the Anadarko basin, and Cambrian of the                       Michigan and Illinois basins.  Now uplifted undeformed and                      deformed sections of the Pennsylvanian of Pennsylvania will be                  compared with the Rhode Island Pennsylvanian and the Silurian                   Clough quartzite of New Hampshire.  The oldest sandstones will be               of Proterozoic quartz arenites from a well-studied section of                   Spitsbergen.  This study has practical significance in the loss                 of porosity of quartz arenites at great depths (4-9km), which                   influences the mass transfer of fluids and thus production of oil               and, especially, gas.",
