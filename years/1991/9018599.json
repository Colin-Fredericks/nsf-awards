 "awd_abstract_narration": "The burrows of macro-infaunal organisms  are generally sites of                 intense microbial activity and often harbor abundant populations                of microorganisms. Since the various infaunal species differ                    greatly in their biology (e.g., feeding guild, motility) and                    specifically, in aspects of their burrow construction and                       ventilation, it is reasonable to anticipate that the microbiology               of their burrows will also vary. This project will test whether a               burrows' increased microbial abundance and activity simply                      represents enhancement of ambient microorganisms or whether there               are specific microbial populations that predictably occur in                    burrows, independent of the ambient microbial community. A                      comprehensive assessment of these complex microbial communities                 will require non-selective methods; the microbes' phospholipid,                 ester-linked fatty acids (PLFA), the chief constituent of                       membrane lipids in eubacteria and eukaryotes will be examined.                  These PLFA, which have already been extracted from field samples                of burrows and ambient sediments, are powerful, discriminating                  tools for determining microbial biomass, composition, and even                  physiological condition. These biochemical markers will be used                 to compare the burrow microbes of five infaunal species,                        representing three phyla, sampled across six sites. Comparisons                 will be made at interspecific and intraspecific levels using                    multivariate analysis. This project will test an intriguing                     biogeochemical hypothesis and impinge on the very attractive                    concept of \"microbial gardening\".",
