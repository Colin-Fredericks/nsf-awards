The                    program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,                      and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise                    and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                             This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research                    visit by Dr. Steven H. Strauss with Drs. W.J. Peacock and                       E.S. Dennis of the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry,                            Canberra, Australia, to study methods for genetically                           engineering sterility in plants, which would benefit                            agriculture and forestry by improving efficient production                      of hybrids, enhancing  vegetative growth, and preventing                        engineered genes from entering natural populations.  Dr.                        Strauss will focus on the isolation of reproductive-specific                    promoters from Brassica.  The collaborators will use                            techniques of subtractive and differential hybridization to                     isolate transcripts as cDNA clones that are expressed                           specifically during reproductive bud development.  They will                    also use reproductive-specific genes characterized in other                     species to facilitate screening of libraries.  Once they                        have cDNAs which show adequate levels of specificity in                         northern analyses, they will be used as probes to screen                        genomic libraries of Arabidopsis, and their sequences used                      to construct primers to enable isolation of ribozymes                           (developed by Plant Industry laboratories) that diminish                        expression of genes essential for reproduction, causing                         plant sterility.                                                                The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel, dependents' allowance, and a flat administrative                        allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
