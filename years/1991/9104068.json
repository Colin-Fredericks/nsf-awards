Sher, Severtsov                              Institute of Evolutionary Animal Morphology and Ecology,                        Moscow, USSR will hold a workshop at the University of                          Alaska, Fairbanks in June 1991 to deal with common                              problems in the interpretation of paleoecological and                           paleoclimatological records in Beringia, eastern Siberia                        and Alaska.  The workshop would be preceded by extended                         work in the field at two critical fossil localities                             which contain somewhat comparable records to those in                           northern Siberia.  This reciprocates a field-workshop                           held on the lower Kolyma lowland in Siberia, sponsored                          by the Soviet Academy of Science.  The far north is a                           special place for studies of past environments and their                        relevance to future global changes.  Beringia has                               repeatedly linked the biota of eastern and western                              hemispheres, affecting both continents in major ways.                           Beringia is an important location for Quaternary                                studies, as this region contains a good record of past                          climatic events and their resulting ecological changes.                         The datable sediments document the effects of these                             changes in the form of paleosols, plant micro- and                              macrofossils, and in rapid mammalian evolution.  Their                          main objective is to bring together U.S. and U.S.S.R.                           scientists in an extended field-workshop situation to                           increase the flow of information east and west, and to                          develop a joint research strategy for the future.                                                                                                               This project in paleoecology/paleoclimatology fulfills                          the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge                         by enabling leading researchers in the United States and                        Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                        research resources in areas of strong mutual interest.",
