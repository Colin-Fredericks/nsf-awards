 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introductory, calculus-based physics is offered in a multiple,                  small lecture/ recitation section format at Union College.                      Through this project the traditional, historically oriented                     content of these currently closely linked sections will be                      replaced by multiple, unlinked sections whose contents will                     have different guiding themes.  Two prototypes are being                        developed under this grant: one based on space physics, the                     other on molecular biophysics.  The thematic approach is                        anticipated to clarify relevance of the basic physical                          principles which are the essence of the courses.  Other                         important changes from current practice are to lower emphasis                   on classical analysis and enhance qualitative reasoning.  To                    this end, use of computers, particularly modern multimedia                      technology, in classroom and laboratory as essential tools is                   a primary focus of the project.  Additionally, laboratory                       format is being reworked to encourage discovery work by the                     students.",
