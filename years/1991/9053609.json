 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will construct a theory of the instructional conditions            that foster sense-making by students learning science.  Sense-making in         science is the effort to coordinate data or information about some              empirical phenomenon with a conceptual or concrete model that explains          it.  We believe this is a critical aspect of learning science that is           missing in most schools.  We will study instructional interactions in           sixth grade classrooms concerned with the causes of seasonal change.            The theoretical model to account for the data, in this case, can be             expressed quite concretely--with a model earth and sun.  There is               preliminary evidence, however, that many students in our classrooms,            especially those from non-mainstream cultures, tend to answer \"why\"             questions with evidence rather than with causal mechanisms and thus             appear not to have appropriated model-based modes of explanation.  For          these students, the apprenticeship into scientific discourse through            sense-making discussions may be particularly important, yet present a           difficult challenge for the teacher.  Our research, therefore, will             address three specific questions:  1.  Under what instructional                 conditions does sense-making occur?  2.  Does the student's discourse           style or mode of \"science talk\" create barriers to their learning               science content through observation of sense-making discourse?  3.              Under what instructional conditions can students learn the expected             discourse style?  Our hypothesis is that an interactive process in which        students' observations, suggestions, or theories are unpackaged,                elaborated or reformulated is necessary in order to develop in students         an understanding of the scientific task as an activity coordinating data        and theory.",
