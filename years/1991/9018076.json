 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants have evolved an effective arsenal of defense systems and are             resistant to the vast majority of attempted infections by fungal                pathogens.  In sharp contrast to cultivar and non-host resistance,              the acknowledged fact that specific plant tissues (e.g., stems and              leaves) are either susceptible or resistant to a particular                     pathogen has not been under investigation as a source for durable               disease resistance.  We have provided first evidence that fungal                cutinases are involved in the determination of fungal tissue                    specificities.  Conclusive evidence exists that they are generally              involved in the penetration of the pathogens through the protective             and polymeric cuticle layer.  Although this function of cutinases               appears identical for most of the pathogens investigated, the                   enzymatic properties are surprisingly diverse.  Evidence exists                 that one of these parameters, the pH-dependency  of cutin                       hydrolysis, is related to the tissue specificity of the respective              pathogens.  This hypothesis will be tested with Alternaria                      brassicicola, an non-specific pathogen that produces both                       prototypes of cutinase.  The enzymes will be purified and                       characterized.  Antibodies will be used to clone both cutinase                  cDNAs and, ultimately, both genes.  The ultimate goal is the                    disruption of each of the cutinase genes independently, and to                  study the impact of these changes on the pathogenicity on different             host tissues.                                                                                                                                                   The ability of a pathogen to infect plant tissues depends on                    factors in both the host and the pathogen.  The pathogen must be                able to invade the plant tissue and avoid a variety of host                     chemical defenses.  To be resistant to infection, the host must                 effectively recognize the pathogen and respond appropriately.  Some             pathogens need a portal of entry, such as a wound, to infect plant              tissues; whereas other more virulent pathogens have the ability to              digest the outer protective layers of the plant and, hence, only                need to come in contact with the plant to initiate infection.  The              outer layer of the plant is composed of an insoluble polymer called             cutin, and invading pathogens must first degrade this layer with                enzymes known as cutinases.  The work supporting this proposal has              shown that tissue specificity of plant pathogens may depend in part             on the different specificities of the cutinase enzymes.  This also              implies that host resistance may depend in part on the                          heterogeneity of the cutinase polymer produced by the plant.  This              work should provide a better understanding of this heterogeneity                that will add to our knowledge of pathogenic specificity that can               be used in the design of new forms of plant defense through changes             in cutin structure.//",
