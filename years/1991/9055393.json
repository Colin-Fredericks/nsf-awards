 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project SMART (Science and Mathematics for Arizona's Rural                      Teachers) is a three year project sponsored by the Mammoth - San                Manuel School District No.8 in San Manuel Arizona.  It is                       designed to improve both the mathematics and science instruction                practiced in grades K-8.  Staff development and curriculum                      implementation workshops and institutes are planned for two                     groups of teachers.  The first group, the Math and Science                      leadership team, will consist of 25 master teachers who will                    participate in leadership institutes each summer for three years.               This group will acquire the background, skills and expertise                    necessary to become part of a facilitator team for teacher                      workshops.  The second group, classroom teachers, will attend                   workshops of their choice designed to address content, teaching                 strategies and effective curriculum needs of teachers.  A series                of workshops will be developed and offered at different sites in                the district.  Instructional  support programs consist of                       workshops for administration, parents and paraprofessionals.                    Partnership activities with school districts, county offices,                   community colleges, universities, state-level educations and                    private funding agencies will be carried out to generate support                for mathematics and science improvement efforts during and after                the NSF project.                                                                                                                                                The NSF funds for this project are being matched by the SMART                   consortia institutions by an amount equivalent to 71% of the                    grant.",
