 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with an important class of                                  stochastic systems, whose dynamic character is                                  undergoing random abrupt changes.  These systems are                            called hybrid systems since they are suitably                                   described in a hybrid space consisting of the usual                             continuous-valued system state or base state and a                              finite valued discrete jump state or system mode.  The                          switching of the mode indicates a change of the base                            state dynamics.  For systems with a finite number of                            modes the optimal estimation problem has                                        computational requirements that are exponentially                               increasing with the time horizon,i.e., infeasible in                            practice.  While a number of estimation and control                             algorithms have been developed for this class of                                problems based on noisy state observations, they relied                         on heuristic approximations.  In view of this, no hard                          results, like stability of the controlled system, could be                      proved.  Performance evaluation for these algorithms                            has been done only via Monte Carlo simulations.                                 The investigation we are proposing will consider the                            following three major problems related to hybrid                                systems: estimation, control and stability.  In the area                        of estimation there ar several practical algorithms and                         we shall focus on developing tools for prediction of                            their performance without recourse to expensive                                 simulations and, in particular, the evaluation                                  of the stability of such algorithms in tracking                                 problems -- a major practical issue in e.g., Air Traffic                        Control Systems.  For controlling such systems there                            are some algorithms, but, since they were developed                             using heuristic approximations to the Stochastic                                Dynamic Programming, one cannot evaluate the                                    stability of the resulting controlled systems.                                  A real-time implementable control algorithm will be                             obtained using an upper bounding technique in the                               Stochastic Dynamic Programming.  This technique will                            then be used to show, with a stochastic Lyapunov                                function, that the resulting closed-loop system is stable.",
