 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most active and currently vigorously pursued research area           in endocrinology in the identification of the receptors for the various         hormones.  An understanding of the role of hormones receptors in                activation of specific genes will further our knowledge regarding the           specifically of hormone action.  The overall aim of this research               proposal is to gain an indepth understanding of one of the primary              actions of the insect juvenile hormone:  The induction of the yolk              protein precursor, Vitellogenin (Vg).  Juvenile hormone is a                    sesquiterpenoid molecule and as such chemically unique among animal             hormones.  It is hypothethized that also here receptors mediate the             hormonal message in analogy to the findings for vertebrate steroid and          thyroid hormones.  The fundamental importance to endocrinology in               general is implied.                                                             In order to achieve this goal, the receptor for JH (so far                      physiologically identified) will be purified to homogeneity.                    Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to this receptor will be generated         and used to monitor the stage and sex specific occurrence of this               receptor.  In addition, the Vg gene will be isolated and the hormone            responsive element (HRE) will be identified.  Since species such as             cockroaches date evolutionarily back to more than 200 M years,                  analogous findings to those from certain vertebrate hormones will gain          significance in evolutionary terms.  Cockroach species have been                amenable for basic research.  Many of the aspects regarding the control         of insect reproduction have been worked out on appropriate cockroach            species first.  The easy manipulation of these animals and their cost           efficiency make them perhaps the animals of choice for certain basic            research in biology.  Furthermore, the identification and                       characterization of the receptor for JH may lead to the design of new           chemicals that can be used in control of agriculturally and medically           injurious insect species, since hormone receptors are the key to                hormone action.",
