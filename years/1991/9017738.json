 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an SGER grant to search for particles which might                  explain the existence of matter we believe exists from the                      motion of galaxies but which heretofore has been invisible to                   any detection scheme.  Such matter is known as \"dark matter\".                   DeRujula, Glashow, et al have hypothesized the existence of                     dark matter in the form of X-, a stable, singly-charged                         particle with mass . 1015\u001aV, velocity . 10-3c, and flux . 1cm-                  2-sec.  In order to begin an exploratory search for the                         hypothesized X-p cosmic rays, investigators at the University                   of Arizona will place a mountain altitude three-counter cosmic                  ray telescope into full operation during the term of this                       grant.  They will search for a reaction cycle:  X-p\u001aX-d,X-                      d+12C\u001a13C+p+X-,X-\u001aX-p, all within the liquid scintillator of                    the counters of the detector.  Each 12C(d,p)13C reaction will                   cause a small (relative to charged particles, E \u001a 1\u001aeV)                         scintillation in the detector.  They will use coincidence                       and anticoincidence techniques to veto large charged-particle                   pulses and photomultiplier tube noise pulses in our telescope's                 counters.  These techniques will allow them to look for a                       series of small scintillations within each counter, which might                 be a signature of a slow massive particle moving through the                    apparatus, catalyzing nuclear reactions.  At the end of the                     term of this grant, they should be able to decide which                         directions to pursue, such as deuterium-enriched counters, more                 counters, more electronics, or long data runs.",
