 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to support a symposium entitled \"Amphibian                     Metamorphosis\" to be held at the Annual Meeting of the American                 Society of Zoologists in San Antonio on December 27-30, 1990. A                 multidisciplinary approach to this subject is planned in order to               reexamine different aspects of amphibian metamorphosis, and the                 focus will be on studies with anurans (frogs). A long time has                  passed since the last meeting dealing exclusively with this                     topic, and many advances, especially in molecular biology and                   immunology, have come about since then. The first meeting                       dedicated exclusively to amphibian metamorphosis was held in 1970               sponsored by Florida State University. In 1983 The British                      Society for Developmental Biology sponsored a symposium on both                 amphibian and insect metamorphosis. These were to only                          comprehensive meetings concerning amphibian metamorphosis that                  have been convened. Modern scientists using divergent techniques                to study a  fundamental problem as metamorphosis do not interact                very often. The hope is to use this symposium to bring together                 these biologists who study many different physiological systems                 and who employ diverse techniques, to allow each scientist to                   develop fresh approaches to his system, and to determine whether                (or how) the different systems interact. The symposium will last                for one and one half days, and will consist of three major areas:               1) Functional MOrphology, 2) Physiology, and 3) Cell and                        Molecular Biology. The major objectives are to determine the                    directions in which the study of metamorphosis should proceed at                this time, and to encourage collaborations between scientists                   working in different disciplines. Because of the relative lack of               contributions concerning the role of the immune system at                       metamorphosis in previous meetings, there will be an emphasis on                immunology in the present symposium.",
