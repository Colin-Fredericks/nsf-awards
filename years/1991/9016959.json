 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three general directions of study are aimed at gaining a                    quantitative understanding of phase separation in multiblock                    polymers.  The first direction intends to address the microphase                separation transition (MST) in polyurethane systems using small-                angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), differential scanning calorimetry                (DSC), and melt rheometry.  Simplified polyurethane systems will be             studied which minimize complications due to hard segment                        crystallization and thermal degradation.  The second direction                  addresses the problem of crystallization in multiblock polymers.                A study of the relationship between crystallization and the MST is              proposed using a polyurethane system whose MST may be altered                   relative to the hard segment melting point.  A SAXS study of                    crystallization and annnealing processes in poly(ether-ester)                   copolymers is also proposed, emphasizing changes in hard domain                 morphology occuring during recrystallization after melting.                     Complementary to these studies is work aimed at understanding the               role of polymerization conditions on spherulitic texture                        development.  The third, and final direction of study is the use of             solid-state NMR techniques to characterize polyurethane morphology.             Model hard segment compounds will be investigated using cross                   polarization/magic-angle spinning techniques with C-13 as the probe             nucleus.  This work will be complemented with proton NMR studies in             order to gain an understanding of site-specific mobilities in the               hard domains.  This work will be extended to polyether-polyurethane             copolymers with an aim toward characterization of the interfacial               regions.",
