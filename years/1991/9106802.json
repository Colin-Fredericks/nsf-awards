 "awd_abstract_narration": "Filamentous cyanobacteria are unique microorganisms which can                   produce energy by plant type photosynthesis and reduce                          atmospheric nitrogen by nitrogen fixation.  Nitrogen fixation is                severely inhibited by the oxygen produced by photosynthesis;                    hence, these two incompatible metabolic processes are spatially                 separated.  Photosynthesis occurs in vegetative cells and                       nitrogen fixation occurs in heterocysts.  Heterocysts are                       terminally differentiated cells which arise in a semi-regular                   pattern in a filament in response to starvation for fixed                       nitrogen.  Nitrogenase is the enzyme complex, localized in                      heterocysts, that is responsible for the reduction of atmospheric               nitrogen to ammonia.  The PI is interested in the regulatory                    signals which control expression of nitrogenase genes in                        heterocysts.  She has recently found a new set of genes that                    appear to code for a second nitrogenase in Anabaena variabilis.                 This second nitrogenase is genetically similar to a vanadium-                   dependent nitrogenase characterized in two species of                           Azotobacter.  It does not appear to be another copy of the                      conventional nitrogenase of Anabaena.  The PI proposes to analyze               the two nitrogenase genes of Anabaena variabilis in an attempt to               identify regulatory sites and regulatory gene that are important                in developmental control of expression of nitrogenases.",
