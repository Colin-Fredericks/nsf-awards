 "awd_abstract_narration": "Navigating complex computer applications has become a critical                  problem.  Understanding what the innate human navigational                      abilities are and how they relate to specific types of                          environmental complexity will facilitate the design of assistive                devices for the navigation of complex computer applications.  Two               different techniques for using spatial information to help                      computer users navigate complex applications have been proposed                 by the authors.  These techniques are derived from studies that                 have shown how the spatial distribution of information constrains               attentional processes in vision.  In this project the researchers               are undertaking an examination of the relationship between the                  structure of computer search tasks and the spatial structure of                 assistance information.  They are constructing four computer                    applications.  In two cases the task and guidance information                   structures are matched in terms of spatial information needs and                spatial information presentation, and in the other two they are                 mismatched.  Use of these applications by subjects will be                      compared on the basis of speed and accuracy.  The research is                   expected to produce a deeper understanding of human-computer task               performance under periods of stress and the need for rapid                      decision-making.",
