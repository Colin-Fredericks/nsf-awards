 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's purpose is to substantially increase retention                   of natural science and math students, especially those with                     poor academic preparation and English language deficiencies,                    through a highly visual, user friendly computer-based learning                  environment that is interactive, powerful and intuitive. An                     electronic classroom of 25 NeXT student stations is being used                  in a comprehensive plan for developing this visual and                          intuitive approach. Discipline specific courseware already                      created by CSLA faculty along with available commercial                         applications is being  used. Each student's station serves as                   an interactive electronic blackboard so that science and math                   can be seen, heard, and explored, thus fully engaging the                       senses in learning. Eight faculty from 5 target disciplines                     have already spent 2 years developing curricular materials and                  designing courseware for the NeXT. In this project the team                     teaches approximately 10 courses in the proposed lab involving                  more than 150 natural science and math undergraduates and 100                   general education students annually. Four new interdisciplinary                 courses are being developed: Using Mathmatica in Science,                       Spreadsheets for Scientists, Visual Display of Scientific                       Information, and Electronic Networking as a Tool in Scientific                  Research. Targeted existing courses are: Biometrics, Biological                 Modelling, Population Genetics, Intro. Chem., Physical Chem.,                   Physical Geology, Computer Aided Map Making, Calculus, Computer                 Graphics, Object Oriented Programming, General Relativity, and                  Theoretical Physics and Astronomy.  Project results are being                   disseminated regionally and nationally, taking advantage of                     faculty experience in running statewide faculty workshops on                    NeXT courseware development.The grantee is matching this award                  from non-Federal sources.",
