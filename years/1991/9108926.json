 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Bove and his                      colleagues will conduct archaeological survey and excavation in                 the Pacific coast region of Guatemala.  Preliminary work has                    indicated the presence of a major site, Texas-Los Chatos (TLC)                  which consists of six large platforms including a major platform-               pyramid construction.  Surrounding this central core in all                     directions are large numbers of smaller platforms and mounds of                 various sizes.  Within a 5 km. radius of this complex are five                  subordinate sites.  These data indicate that the development of                 cultural complexity, possible at a state level of organization,                 occurred not only in Southern Mexico and Belize, the heart of the               Mayan lowlands, but extended into other regions as well.  The                   goal of this project is to reconstruct the cultural sequence at                 TLC and to set it into a broader regional context.  To accomplish               this, Dr. Bove and his colleagues will conduct a complete survey                of the area.  They will accompany this with excavation in                       selected locations.  Lithics and ceramics will be analyzed.                     Chemical characterization of latter will permit identification of               non-local materials and hopefully allow reconstruction of broader               trade networks.                                                                                                                                                 Archaeologists have focussed considerable attention on the                      prehistoric Maya and related groups which inhabited lowland                     Middle America.  In a difficult environment which today supports                only low population densities, these prehistoric societies                      developed a civilization characterized by hierarchical                          organization of large numbers of people, a complex calendric                    system and the construction of large monuments.  Scientists wish                to understand the processes which lead to the rise and later                    decline of this society.  While much is now known about the                     \"heartland\" areas, other regions such as coastal Guatemala have                 received relatively little consideration.  This project will help               to remedy this deficit.                                                                                                                                         This research is important for several reasons.  It will produce                data of interest to many archaeologists.  It will increase our                  understanding of Middle American prehistory and shed new insight                into the rise of complex societies.",
