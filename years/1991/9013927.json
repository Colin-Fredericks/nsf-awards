 "awd_abstract_narration": "While much progress has been made in the forecasting of                    locally heavy snowfalls, there are still times when our                         technology is not capable of adequately anticipating these                      events.  A major focus of the mesoscale meteorological community                is to further our understanding of the processes responsible for                locally heavy snows and, therefore, eventually to improve the                   forecasting of these events.                                                         Under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions Program,                  the Principal Investigator will perform a detailed diagnostic                   investigation of a record setting snowstorm that occurred in the                upper midwest of the U.S.  While the forecasts of this storm did                indicate that a significant storm would affect the region, the                  mesoscale (local) features and timing of the heaviest snow were                 not forecast.  In this research, the Principal Investigator will                use conventional operational information and data from a local                  surface network to attempt to test a series of hypotheses that                  should help clarify the reasons for the timing and quantity of                  precipitation from this storm.  Two undergraduate students will                 participate fully in this research with one being supported via                 cost sharing from the Principal Investigator's institution.",
