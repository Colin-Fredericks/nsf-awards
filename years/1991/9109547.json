 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will plan, build and evaluate a computer-supported                cooperative problem solving environment that teaches people how                 to solve problems by working together.  The environment is based                on a communication competency model that assumes that a group's                 effectiveness depends upon the performance of communication                     competencies (or skills) that aid groups in solving problems.                   The model provides a preliminary categorization of the various                  communicative competencies that, in turn, can be represented in a               computer-supported cooperative work environment through online                  tools designed to support related communication functions.                      Several precursors of this system have been developed by the                    principal investigator and were designed to teach effective                     problem solving skills, assess mission success, and support                     computer-supported cooperative problem solving for an information               retrieval task.  This work extends that research by developing a                special computer-supported interface that can be used to                        investigate how to teach people to use communication competencies               in order to solve problems more effectively.",
