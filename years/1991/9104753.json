 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between paleotopography and modern morphology is          necessary to understanding the formation of barrier islands and lagoons,        two of the most critical environments along the U.S. coastline.  This           doctoral dissertation project will study the processes of barrier island        lagoonal development on the southern Delmarva Pennisula of the eastern          shore of Virginia.  It will examine the implications of those processes         for barrier coastline development.  Pollen, grain size, microfossil, and        x-ray radiography analyses will be used to develop a clear picture of           the nature of the topography before the spread of the sea over the area         and of the timing of the inundation of the surface.                                                                                                                  This project will generate valuable information about barrier              island evolution by increasing our understanding of the position of             present coastal morphology in the continuum of Holocene coastal change.         By adding to our knowledge of this evolution, this project will                 contribute to our ability to deal with the potential increase in the            complexity of the management of these coastal environments should the           sea-level change.  This project also will provide an excellent                  opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop                independent research skills.",
