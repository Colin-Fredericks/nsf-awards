 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of specialized infection structures including                   appressoria is a prerequisite for infection of plants by several                pathogenic fungi.  An appressorium is formed by the differentiation             of a single-cell germ tube.  Differentiation is induced by a                    thigomotropic (touch) stimulus.  In the bean rust fungus, Uromyces              appendiculatus, induction of differentiation requires contact with              a specific topography of a physical surface such as a collodion                 membrane impregnated with oil or a 0.5 micrometer ridge on a                    plastic surface which resembles the surface of a host plant leaf.               The over-all goal of this research is to understand how the touch               stimulus initiates developmental events.  Preliminary results have              shown that the touch stimulus induces mitosis and expression of six             differentiation-specific genes.  Since it is difficult to                       characterize directly the \"receptor\" for the touch stimulus, the                strategy has been to trace the steps of the signal transduction                 pathway backward, beginning from the documented effects of the                  stimulus, e.g. mitosis and specific gene-expression.  As a first                step, using polyclonal antibodies against the yeast cdc2 kinase,                induction of a cdc2-like protein has been observed in                           differentiated germlings.  On western blots, this protein is not                detectable in undifferentiated germlings.  The rust homologue of                the cdc2 gene will be cloned and the temporal expression of mRNA                for the protein will be studied.  Since many cell cycle specific                genes are regulated at the transcriptional level, the further goals             of this project will be to identify trans-acting factors that bind              to the promoter region of the gene.  Further goals are to                       characterize the touch-specific gene, INF88, and localize the                   encoded protein in vivo.  The sequence, CCGCGTTAA, has been                     identified about 300 bp from the transcription site(s) of INF24.                This sequence is very similar to the sequence, ACGCGTTAA, present               in several cell cycle specific genes including the thymidylate                  synthase (cdc21) gene in yeast.  Starting from a restriction                    fragment containing this sequence, trans-acting factors binding to              this region will be sought.  Identification and characterization                of these factors should reveal other components of the signal                   transduction pathway.  Finally, to gain further insight into the                function of the protein encoded by another differentiation-specific             gene, INF24, the protein will be isolated from the differentiated               germlings and its biochemcial and biophysical properties studied.                                                                                               The results of this research will further our understanding of how              a touch stimulus initiates the developmental changes that allow                 this fungus to invade its plant host.",
