 "awd_abstract_narration": "Few explorations of the implications of the important relations            between surveillance, space, and social control have been made outside          the narrow institutional confines of prisons, asylums, and similar              settings.  During the nineteenth century, the U. S. government expended         considerable effort to bring Native Americans under its dominion, and           its task was particularly difficult in the case of the more mobile              tribes.  No native group posed a greater threat to American expansion           than the Northern Great Plains Indians.  The eventual conquest of the           Northern Plains tribes depended crucially on the U. S. government's             dealings with the Red Cloud band of the Dakota Indians during the span          of existence of the Red Cloud Indian Agency, 1871-1880.  This doctoral          dissertation proposal poses the following significant historical                geographical question about the conquest:  Did social control dependent         significantly on surveillance and did surveillance in turn depend on            spatial characteristics of the watched population?  The project will            use documents on microfilm at the National Archives in Washington which         include correspondence between Indian agents and Commissioners of               Indian Affairs, records of the Dakota Superintendancy, annual reports           of Sioux ageneices, correspondence of the departments of War and                Interior, and records of treaty negotiations to construct a detailed            history of the conquest of the Red Cloud band.  It will assess the              degree to which this history was driven by relationships between                spatial fixation, the production of knowledge, and social control.                                                                                                   This research focuses on the spatial aspects of processes of               modernization that have not as yet been recognized as prerequisites             for the establishment of modern social control.  It will provide                valuable information on the relationship between space, knowledge and           social control.  If the hypothesis that the links between space,                knowledge, and control were important to the establishment of control           over the Red Cloud band is supported by documentary evidence, the               research will contribute to establishing a new niche for historical             geographers and for geographers interested in the present day:                  describing and explaining the spatial conditions of possibility for             modern social control based on surveillance.  The project also will             provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to               continue to develop independent research skills.",
