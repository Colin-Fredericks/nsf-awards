As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                    Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                     Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                 initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                 of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                  properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                 geospace model with predictive capability.                                           The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                             magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                   connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                   ionosphere.  This grant is concerned with theoretical modeling                  of the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL) and its mappings and                  electrical coupling to the dayside ionosphere.  The primary                     objectives are to advance current understanding of (i) the field                line mapping between the LLBL and the ionosphere, and (ii) the                  generation and distribution of the dayside region 1 currents and                the associated convection and particle precipitation.",
