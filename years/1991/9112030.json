 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the growth of concern about global environmental change,                   many recognize the importance of understanding how the public                   comes to perceive threats to the environment and biodiversity and               to be ready to act upon their perception.  This understanding is                valuable to countries grappling with environmental issues, to                   policy makers seeking to avoid unproductive conflicts, and to                   researchers dealing with questions about the environment and                    technological risk.  This proposal is timely both in addressing a               current issue of prime importance and in undertaking                            investigation of attitudes toward the environment and risk in a                 developing country at a critical moment when environmental                      awareness is changing.  A highly qualified investigator with                    extensive experience in Brazil will collaborate with Brazilian                  scientists and technicians in studying cultural values and social               attitudes toward environmental risk at several contrasting sites.               By interviewing key informants and by conducting survey research,               the investigator and his Brazilian associates will gather data on               emerging ecological awareness.  This data should be of use in                   Brazil and elsewhere for coping with environmental issues.  It                  should also contribute to an ongoing international discussion                   about how social and cultural attitudes shape judgments about                   environmental risk.  In addition, this project will support the                 training of researchers and the research infrastructure in a                    developing country and contribute to efforts toward preserving                  biodiversity.                                                                                                                                                   This proposal is a reasonable request for support to enable a                   leading scholar and associates to address the problem of                        environmental awareness and the readiness to act on that                        awareness.  The principal investigator and project associates are               well qualified; institutional support is very good; the research                plan is well conceived; and the findings will be valuable to lay                people, policy makers, and research specialists in a number of                  fields.  Support is highly recommended.",
