 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an ethnographic study of client governance in                   Project Head Start.  Head Start, a federal pre-school program for               poor families that has gained wide public acceptance, gives                     parents--generally poor women--substantial legal power to make                  management decisions at the local level.  Head Start's client                   governance component has endured for over a quarter century and                 remains strong.  As such, the program provides a rich store of                  empirical data on issues of institutional design and cultural                   pluralism that are both timely and poorly understood.  Through                  demographic and archival research, open-ended interviews with                   parents and staff, participant observation, and conversational                  analysis of parent deliberations, the study will provide a                      detailed, comparative account of the interplay between legal                    framework and local culture in Head Start's client governance                   process.  Two broad themes, power and community, will structure the             data collection and guide the data analysis over a one-year period              in two field sites.                                                                                                                                             Parent participation provides an opportunity to explore problems                of democratic control over bureaucracies.  This research will                   address theoretical and policy-oriented issues relating to the                  law's capacity to facilitate greater participation by ethnically                and economically subordinated groups in the social institutions of              the welfare state.  The study will inform our understanding of how              parent governance is being enacted, how the formal structure of the             law is guiding that enactment, and how that enactment distributes               power and facilitates community at the local level.  As such, it                will illuminate the complex processes of citizen governance and                 will suggest how the law might more effectively enable the well-                being of women and their families within those communities.  Also,              the research will provide a basis for more generally assessing the              potential and limits of parent governance reforms in education.",
