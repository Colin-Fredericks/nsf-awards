 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Lacy has constructed an echelle spectrograph which is an order              of magnitude more sensitive than other available instruments for                spectroscopy of moderate to high resolution at mid-infrared                     wavelengths.  With this grant he will continue his pioneering work              in this wavelength region of the spectrum.  Three projects will be              emphasized: 1) He will investigate the relative importance of gas-              phase and grain-surface reactions on the composition of molecular               clouds by observing absorption of various molecules in the gaseous              and solid phases; 2) He will study the pure rotational line                     emission of molecular hydrogen, to learn about the conditions in                shocked gas and photodissociation regions, and to determine the                 ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide; and 3) He will observe the                mid-infrared emission lines of ions of neon and sulfur to study the             kinematics and excitation of infrared luminous galaxies.                                                                                                        There are two principal advantages to the mid-infrared spectral                 region for astronomical spectroscopy: the small interstellar                    extinction relative to that at shorter wavelengths, and the                     presence of several interesting spectral features, notably                      vibrational transitions of molecules and fine-structure lines of                ions.  Many objects which are unobservable, because of extinction,              at visible or near-infrared wavelengths become accessible in the                mid-infrared.  Spectral lines of molecules and ions provide                     valuable information about the kinematics and physical conditions               of the newly revealed objects.  Dr. Lacy's spectrograph represents              a significant advance in the quality of instrumentation for                     exploring objects at mid-infrared wavelengths.",
