 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sanders proposes to complete two case studys in which                      significant weather features are present which have not been                    intensively analyzed previously, and a third study in which the                 prediction skills of two operational Numerical Weather Prediction               models are assessed and compared. The region covered in the third               study is the western North Atlantic, and the period of concern is               the winter of 1988-89, when a significantly enhanced                            observational system was deployed at sea as part of project                     ERICA. ERICA was mounted after Sanders' prior pioneering research               focussed attention on the weather phenomenon he labelled                        \"explosive marine cyclogenesis\". The subject phenomenon of the                  first study is an organized but isolated thunderstorm system                    which produced many tornadoes and much damaging hail, again cap-                tured in an ehanced observational network, this time deployed du-               ring the 1985 O-K PRESTORM field project. That of the second                    study  is a form of sloping roll circulation that often develops                as part of the process of frontal formation. It is associated                   with alternating lines of heavy and little rain, and with alter-                nating layers of saturated and extremely dry air aloft. Sanders                 has been a leader in synoptic meteorology for decades. He has                   established a record of using methods and theory in the forefront               of atmospheric science in the study of those weather systems                    which directly affect human safety and property.",
