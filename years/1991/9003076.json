 "awd_abstract_narration": "Refined Languages (Refined Fortran, Refined C, etc.) are                   extensions of their parent languages in which it is possible to                 express parallelism, but impossible to create races.  Where strictly            deterministic behavior is desired, multiple executions of a Refined             Fortran program with the same input data can be guaranteed to either            compute the same results or terminate with the same run-time errors             regardless of differences in scheduling.  Where asynchronous behavior           is desired, freedom from races can be guaranteed.  The Refined                  Languages approach achieves its goal by extending sequential                    imperative programming languages with data- (rather than control-)              oriented terms.                                                                      Specification of Refined ANSI Fortran `77, and construction of an          interprocedural Fortran `77 code analysis tool are complete.  This              award is to modify the specification to Fortran `8X, extend the                 analysis tool into a Refined Fortran `8X compiler, and exploit the              special features of Refined Languages to construct a Refined Fortran            `8X symbolic debugger.  Formal study of the comparative expressive              powers of control-oriented parallel imperative languages and data-              oriented parallel imperative languages will ensue.",
