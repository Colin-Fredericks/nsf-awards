 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project matches the \"at risk\" population of Head Start and its             staff with the expertise of the Hands On Science Outreach (HOSO) program        in producing playful units of lesson guides, manipulative kits and              teacher training.  Working with mathematics consultants, three units            (fall, winter and spring) have been designated around NUMERATION, CHANCE        AND GEOMETRY.                                                                                                                                                   The activities in the program will be multi-cultural, multi-sensory and         will focus around toys and games which the children will be able to take        home and own.  They will take into consideration the development of both        large and small motor skills.  There will be clear indications for              interdisciplinary classroom use.  Parent information will be available          in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese, with a visual videotape component          and meetings planned into the project.  These should help apply home            continuity for the relevancy of mathematics concepts to everyday                activities.                                                                                                                                                     The MATHSTART units will be piloted, evaluated and refined in five              demographically different Head Start programs in Maryland.  After               refinement, further dissemination will occur through both the Head Start        and HOSO networks.",
