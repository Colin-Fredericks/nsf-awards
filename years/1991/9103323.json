 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator is completing a book on the National Science                 Foundation and federal patronage of the biological sciences in                  the period of 1945-1975, viewed as a case study for the                         illumination of broader themes on science and public policy.                    The existing study is a good agency history, showing that                       individual decisions as well as institutional dynamics have                     shaped NSF patronage of biology in a pluralistic system of                      federal support of science.  To reshape the manuscript so that                  it can become a significant work in the history of science,                     alternative points of view using sources other than NSF need                    to be incorporated.  Among the issues to be investigated are:                   tensions between basic and applied research and between biology                 and medicine; strategies of supporting basic biology in the                     context of a pluralistic system of federal funding agencies;                    competition with National Institutes of Health; elitism versus                  support of the infrastructure of science; and the role of                       federal \"science managers.\"  With past concentration on agency                  records, through new research in the recent history of biology                  and in the history of science and education policy, the                         investigator will incorporate a broader range of perspectives.                  Four areas of biology, each with different patterns of federal                  support, will be examined in order to address the key issue of                  how the development of biological ideas and institutions                        relates to patterns of federal patronage, namely: (1) the                       revolution in molecular biology; (2) photosynthesis; (3)                        systematic biology; and (4) ecology.                                              This effort is to transform a narrative heavily based on                      institutional records into a case study for illumination of                     broader themes of science and public policy.  Thus, in                          attempting to integrate the agency history with the history of                  biology, the question of what difference did NSF make to the                    biological sciences will be addressed.  The project furthers                    VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for women to                    advance their careers in science or engineering through                         research, and to encourage other women to pursue careers in                     these areas through the investigators' enhanced visibility as                   role models on the host campuses.  In this project, the                         proposed activities which contribute to the second objective                    include:  teaching courses on Women and Science, the Social                     History of American Science, and the History of Medicine;                       giving seminars; organizing a symposium on women and science                    in conjunction with the Women's Studies Program; developing an                  exhibit on early women scientists in Florida; and counseling                    women students.",
