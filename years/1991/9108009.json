 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Wenzl will continue his previous research using                  braid groups to construct interesting examples of subfactors of                 certain factors of von Neumann algebras.  The following points will             be emphasized: (a) It is planned to find a simpler and more                     conceptual approach to these examples using the theory of quantum               groups more explicitly.  Moreover, the braid groups will be used to             construct other interesting subfactors.  (b) Quantum groups also                played an important role in the proof of the existence of certain               invariants of 3-manifolds.  Professor Wenzl plans to extend the                 approach used in this construction to treat not only the quantized              Lie algebra of the special linear group in two dimensions, but all              the classical Lie algebras.                                                          Professor Wenzl's research is in the area of self-adjoint                  operator algebras.  These are families of operators (infinite                   dimensional matrices) with a certain reality condition imposed to               make the algebras self-adjoint.  Recent discoveries involving how               one of these algebras sits inside another have brought together a               bewildering variety of fields and have added immeasurably to our                knowledge about these fields.  Professor Wenzl's project will                   contribute to these developments.",
