 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the study of the structure of classes of             functions computable in resource bounded parallel computation models,           such as the parallel random access machine and families of boolean              circuits.  The project specifically concerns (1) equational logics,             higher-type functionals, finite typed lambda calculi and associated             programming languages related to the parallel complexity class NC of            polylogarithmic time and its subclasses and (2) boolean circuit                 complexity, the relation between the family of invariance groups of a           language and the its parallel complexity, the relation between the              \"algebraic\" structure of a regular language, and characterization of            low-level uniform parallel complexity classes in terms of Bel'tyukov's          stack-register machines.                                                             This research will use techniques from complexity theory, proof            theory (mathematical logic), combinatorics, and finite group theory.            The work on equational logics, lambda calculi and higher-type                   functionals, and Bel'tyukov machines will build on new recursion                theoretic characterizations of the parallel complexity class NC and             its subclasses.                                                                      The goal of this research is to increase our understanding of              parallel complexity classes:  (1) higher type functionals lead to               sequential, modular programming languages which compute exactly the             functions of certain parallel complexity classes, (2) free variable             equational logics shed light on combinatorial principles involving              counting and which admit polynomial size Frege proofs, a direction of           research related to the N P =? co- N P question, (3) Bel'tyukov                 machines will clarify questions of containment of low level parallel            complexity classes.",
