 "awd_abstract_narration": "The causes of variations in the axial morphology of mid-                   ocean ridges is poorly understood and has been related to a                     number of factors such as spreading rate and distance from                      ridge-transform intersections. From bathymetric profiles from                   the North Atlantic, the Principal Investigator has extracted the                following parameters: latitude, spreading rate, distance from                   ridge-transform intersection, zero-age depth, rift-valley                       relief, rift-valley width, and smoothed variations of the latter                three variables. He has done linear correlation and multiple                    regression analyses of these data and reached several                           conclusions based on the correlations among parameters. This                    project will extend this work to analyze in a similar manner a                  world-wide bathymetric and gravity data set with the goal of                    determining which are the most important factors controlling the                overall morphology of mid-ocean ridges.",
