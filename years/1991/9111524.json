 "awd_abstract_narration": "Defensive behavior is controlled by physical and chemical events                within the central nervous system. These events are influenced by               environmental, hormonal and genetic factors. Dr. Caroline                       Blanchard is a expert on the behavioral aspects of defense. This                Career Advancement Award is made for the purpose of advanced                    training in new techniques so that Dr. Blanchard can enhance her                skills in the areas of the neuroanatomical and neurochemical                    bases of defensive behavior. The technique of receptor binding                  autoradiography will be used to demonstrate where in the brain                  specific chemicals are active and what factors can change the                   binding patterns. The technique of direct chemical stimulation                  will be used to explore which brain sites and which chemical                    transmitter signals are important in influencing specific                       behaviors. Neuroendocrinological techniques will focus on the                   role of brain hormones. By studying connections among different                 neural groups, the circuits involved in behavior can be                         determined. Part of this award involves collaborative research                  with a group of Russian neuroscientists who are interested in                   genetic aspects of behavioral defense systems. Knowledge gained                 from these studies will lead to an increased understanding of the               neural mechanisms of defense.",
