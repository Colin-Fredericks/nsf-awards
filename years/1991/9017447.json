Structure will be                    determined for these intermediates by a comparison of solution                  phase and solid state nmr spectroscopy, by electrochemical                      techniques, and by employing transient and steady state                         illumination as probes for excited state reactivity. Of particular                                                                                              interest will be the determination of how structure influences the                                                                                              acidities and oxidation potentials of several families of                       dianions, radical ions, and stable radicals. Fundamental                        thermochemical information will be attained by correlating rates                of photochemical and thermal electron transfer with redox                       potentials derived by high speed cyclic voltammetry or                          photomodulation voltammetry. A new thrust  exploring                            photochemistry in supercritical fluids will seek to probe                       solvation effects under carefully controlled conditions. In these                                                                                               studies, scientifically important questions will be probed of how                                                                                               aggregation, environment, and solvation affect chemical                                                                                                         reactivity, particularly electron transfer reactions.

This research will generate results of a                                                                                                  fundamental nature about reactive intermediates in chemical                                                                                                     reactions. The mechanistic basis of organic chemistry rests on an                                                                                               understanding of the properties of reactive intermediates and                                                                                                   their involvement in chemical transformations. Knowledge of these                                                                                               intermediates will provide chemists with a better ability to                                                                                                    predict the course of chemical reactions.",
