 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomical imaging can provide excellent opportunities for                    undergraduate students to explore the science of astronomy, the                 process of scientific investigation, and the technology of                      imaging and image processing.  Students are using a CCD camera                  attached to Grinnell's 0.61 m telescope to carry out a wide                     variety of observational programs and processing the resulting                  images on the observatory's Sun workstation using IRAF and                      other image processing software.  Projects involve the study of                 relatively faint objects (galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters)                 and emphasize the extraction of physical information from the                   images through, for example, the use of filters during the                      exposures, and computer analysis of the resulting images.  This                 instrumentation is used most heavily by physics majors who are                  doing one or two-semester independent study projects, but is                    also used in the general astronomy and advanced laboratory                      courses.  The acquisition of a CCD camera system completes the                  process of development of image acquisition and analysis                        capability at Grinnell's observatory that has taken place over                  the past several years.",
