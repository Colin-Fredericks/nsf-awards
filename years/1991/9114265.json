Jackson                    and Kahr will assemble and characterize a series of                             triarymethyls and their metal ion complexes. Diradical                          cryptands will also be synthesized to isolate the pairwise                      electronic interactions that are responsible for magnetic order                 in the extended materials. Their collaborative study will                       address structural and theoretical features that relate to                      magnetic coupling and will probe the requirements for design of                 molecular solids with long-range structure.                                     %%%                                                                             Simple organic paramagnets have been thoroughly studied during                  the past 30 years, and their magnetic characteristics can be                    analyzed adequately via application of current theory. However,                 the origins of collective magnetic properties, such as common                   ferromagnetism, are incompletely understood. Drs. Jackson and                   Kahr have designed approaches to the synthesis of new organic                   ferromagnetic materials that are likely to possess novel                        magnetic properties. The new materials that are likely to                       result upon completion of this research have potential                          application for the development of improved information storage                 and retrieval systems.",
