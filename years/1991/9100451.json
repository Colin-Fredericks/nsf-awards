A significant portion of the                       ship's operating schedule in recent years and again in 1991                     is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The                          Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea                      component and an ashore component.                                                                                                                              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                         personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; main-                       tenance, repair, and calibration of scientific instru-                          mentation; instruction and supervision of deck operations;                      and providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going                   scientific parties.  On shore activities include the mainten-                   ance, repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equip-                     ment and assisting scientific personnel in preparing for                        field work on the vessel.  Shipboard technicians funded by                      this award have broad responsibilities for providing the                        coordination and assistance needed for the successful                           completion of research projects at sea.  The level of                           activity and amount of support are closely related to the                       size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                    and capability.",
