 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contractility is one of the fundamental properties of life and                  exhibited by nearly all cell types.  Cell contraction occurs by                 converting chemical energy into mechanical work.  In muscle                     tissue, contraction generates large force, an is carried out by a               specialized structure called a \"cross-bridge\".  The cross-bridge                is a portion of a large contractile protein \"myosin\", and it                    generates force by interacting with another protein called                      \"actin\" (an activator).  Contraction is fueled by adenosine                     triphosphate (ATP), the universal energy source of all living                   organisms.  Our main objective is to document the fundamental                   mechanisms of contraction at the molecular level.  To explore the               structure-function relationship, we will employ a technique                     called protein isoform substitution.  In this method, a                         contractile protein is replaced with that of naturally occurring                isoform, which has a known structural modification.  By examining               the resulting molecular motion of the reconstituted muscle                      system, we can determine the relationship between the particular                structural modification and the functional alteration.  In our                  study we will use the vertebrate skeletal muscle model, but the                 techniques developed and the knowledge acquired can be applied to               cardiac and smooth muscle, as well as to non-muscle motility.  In               the long run, we hope that these techniques and the knowledge                   gained will benefit the understanding and treatment of muscular                 dystrophies and related dysfunctions.//",
