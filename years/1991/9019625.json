 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heterotrophic bacteria recycle carbon, regulate dissolve                        organics, and comprise much of the biomass of the oceans. Typical               organisms are culture resistant, and a factor of 20 smaller with                one-tenth the DNA  of commonly studied bacteria. To study these                 oligotrophic ultramicrobacteria, Dr. Button has developed                       several new techniques. One is high resolution flow cytometry                   which gives a rapid accurate analysis of populations in seawater                and cultures derived from them, including measurements of                       population, cell size and DNA content per cell. Another is                      janusian kinetics which bases nutrient transport rates on                       molecular composition and allows improved descriptions of the                   ability of whole cells to collect nutrients. Third is a dilution-               culture procedure which greatly expands the number of                           oligotrophic bacterial species that can be cultured.                            Representatives of what appear to be typical marine bacteria are                now on hand. Preliminary data indicate peculiar sensitivity                     exhibited as a growth-dependency of individual organisms on the                 presence of others. Dr. Button will to explore these peculiar                   population dependencies, bacteria and the distributions of                      organisms that have them, their nutritional requirements, kinetic               characteristics, and ability to attain high population densities,               in an effort to understand the dynamics and ecology of marine                   microorganisms in the context of kinetic control of dissolved                   organics.",
