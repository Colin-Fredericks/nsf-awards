 "awd_abstract_narration": "The behavior of labor markets seems extremely puzzling from the                 point of view of economic theory and especially the theory of                   competitive equilibrium.  Perhaps the biggest puzzle is the                     insensitivity of wages to the unemployment rate.  High                          unemployment should represent an excess supply of labor, yet the                unemployed do not seem to bid down wages very effectively.  If                  labor markets acted like truly competitive markets, then wages                  should plunge in the face of high unemployment, just as stock and               commodity markets sometimes do.  Yet wage cuts in recessions seem               to be moderate and infrequent.  Another puzzle is that wages do                 not always respond immediately and completely to changes in the                 consumer price index, whereas most theories of wages determine                  real, not nominal wages.  A third puzzle is the occurrence of                   strikes.  Strikes seem to cause an unnecessary loss to both                     employer and employees, since it should be possible to anticipate               the consequences of a strike and reach an agreement without one.                The thesis of this project is that these and other puzzles in                   economics can be best explained by a new theory of decision                     making under uncertainty that captures the instability or                       fragility of expectations.                                                                                                                                      This grant also supports theoretical research on general                        equilibrium models which express macroeconomic phenomena.  The                  distinctive feature of these models is that firms are able to                   compete effectively only in the long-run; in the short-run firms                have difficulty invading each others markets.  This difficulty                  would make firms have a low short-run elasticity of demand for                  labor.  The rivalry among firms would be expressed by a non-                    cooperative equilibrium.  The conditions under which such an                    equilibrium will exist are rigorously defined.  Unemployment is                 shown to exist and fluctuate.  The determinants of the average                  growth rate of the economy are analyzed and shown to offer a                    plausible explanation of the wide variation of growth rates among               countries.  The welfare losses resulting from unemployment and                  from the monopoly power of businesses are estimated.  The project               compares the costs and benefits of wage controls within such a                  theoretical framework.  The project also analyzes government                    policies controlling inflation.",
