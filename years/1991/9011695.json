The planning for this conference was                     supported under DIR-8912577.  The conference will bring together                leaders of both fields from around the world in order to discuss                the issues to be addressed at the meeting.   Each society is                    sponsoring symposia that cut across time periods and geographic                 boundaries, and provide important comparative insights on the                   development of science and technology.  Similarly, sessions devoted             to methodologies should stimulate new kinds of research and shed                light on the boundaries of history of science and history of                    technology from closely related fields.  Plenary sessions are                   intended to address issues of common concern to all historians of               science and of technology.  The papers are being distributed prior              to the meeting.  The discussions at the conference will be                      transcribed and a final volume of the papers and salient points of              the discussion will be published.",
