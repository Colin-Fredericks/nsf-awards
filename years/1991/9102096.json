There is a number                     of planned special activities which are important to minority                   faculty, particularly those from minority institutions.                         Among the planned activities are (1) special sessions                           addressing unique programs for minorities, (2) panels                           addressing federal funding possibilities for minority                           research programs, (3) an employment register, (4) graduate                     schools describing opportunities for minorities, and (5) a                      special session in the chairs' program addressing problems                      associated with administering a computer science program at a                   minority institution.

It is important                      that minority faculty attend national conferences in order to                   become better integrated into the research and education                        communities.  This project represents a strong effort in that                   direction.",
