 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social insects provide nature's most conspicuous example of                altruistic behavior, in which some individuals sacrifice their                  survival and reproduction for the benefit of others.  Theories of               the evolution of altruism have therefore emphasized social                      insects.  The theory of kin selection predicts that social insect               colonies should be groups of close relatives, and this is usually               true.  However, when there are many egg-laying queens per colony,               average relatedness is expected to be quite low.  The maintenance               of worker altruism then becomes more problematic, unless workers                are locked into their role by a specialized morphology.  From                   this perspective, the social insects that most challenge current                understanding of the maintenance of worker behavior are the                     swarm-founding wasps of the neo-tropics, because they combine the               multiple-queen habit with little or no morphological                            differentiation between workers and queens.                                          Study of this group will answer two vital questions.  First,               how low is relatedness among colony-mates in these wasps?                       Second, what factors other than queen number influence                          relatedness, especially in cases where relatedness is higher than               expected?  If relatedness is very low, then these studies will                  show that current theories of the evolution of sociality may need               revision.  If relatedness is not low, then the problem posed by                 the presence of multiple queens will be solved.  Further                        investigations into why relatedness is not low will uncover the                 forces that help to maintain altruistic behavior in this group.",
