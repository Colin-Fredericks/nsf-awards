The                    program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,                      and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise                    and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                             This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research                    visit by Jay R. Hoinville of Washington University with D.J.                    Mapps of the School of Electronic, Communication, and                           Electrical Engineering of Polytechnic South West, Devon,                        United Kingdom.  The researchers will investigate magnetic                      recording by developing and characterizing new recording                        head technologies.  The size of a recorded bit cell depends                     on the size of the recording head and on the spacing between                    the medium and the head.  By taking advantage of the                            benefits of reduction of geometric scale, the researchers                       hope to develop recording heads which produce areal densities                   on the order of 1Mbit/mm2.  They propose to develop a head                      which can be used to read/write in contact with the medium                      and which has a tract width of 1um.                                                                                                                             The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the                      U.S. home institution.",
