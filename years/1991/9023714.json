 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research project aimed at developing an                               improved understanding of the behavior of                                       materials and structural elements (beams, plates,                               membranes) employed in the manufacture of                                       micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), on the                                 basis of the microstructure exhibited by the                                    materials, with the goal of assessing the                                       performance reliability of such systems.  Effective                             (overall) physical properties, primarily elasticity and                         strength, and the associated structural response will                           be evaluated with the recognition that there are a                              number of microstructural effects that are                                      important at the length scales associated with                                  MEMS but which are unimportant at larger length                                 scales. These include the typical linear dimension of                           a crystallite within the material being on the same                             order of magnitude as the thickness of the film,                                substantial through-thickness variations in grain size                          and shape, the presence of considerable alignment                               of the grains (texture) leading to anisotropy of                                response, and large levels of residual stress arising                           form the processes used to create may MEMS.                                     Such effects may preclude direct application of                                 classical theories for structural elements, thus                                necessitating the development of new theories.                                  Furthermore, the variability inherent in the                                    microstructure, which depends strongly on the                                   process conditions, requires a probabilistic                                    description of the material behavior and structural                             response evaluation aimed at assessing the                                      performance reliability of MEMS.  To this end, this                             research will address:  (1) mathematical modeling                               of material strength and effective properties, (2)                              influence of microstructure on the structural                                   response of MEMS, and (3) reliability analysis of                               MEMS using stochastic finite-element methods.",
