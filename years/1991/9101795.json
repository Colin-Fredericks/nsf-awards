 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the past research program in unconstrained and           constrained optimization.  The project has three main parts.  First,            limited memory methods will be developed for large bound constrained            and nonlinearly constrained optimization problems.  A new algebraic             representation of the limited memory update developed earlier will              greatly facilitate the use of the limited memory approached for                 constrained optimization, and should help produce very efficient                methods for large constrained problems.  Second, tensor methods will            be developed for large, sparse nonlinear problems, including nonlinear          equations, nonlinear least squares, and unconstrained optimization,             and also for nonlinearly constrained optimization problems.  This               approach shows great promise of producing methods that are very robust          and efficient on nonsingular and singular problems and that, in the             sparse case, can efficiently use any desired direct or iterative                solver.  Third, new trust region methods will be developed and                  analyzed for nonlinearly constrained optimization problems with                 inequality and equality constraints.  These methods are expected to             have strong global convergence properties even in the presence of               linearly dependent constraint gradients, and to perform robustly and            efficiently in practice.  In addition, research will be carried out on          a modified Cholesky factorization for large sparse constrained                  optimization, and on efficient methods for implicit nonlinear least             squares problems.",
