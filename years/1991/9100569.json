 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue an REU program which is                   designed to provide highly motivated undergraduates, especially                 women, and minorities with the opportunity to develop their                     skills as archaeological field scientists while working within                  the context of the Naco Valley Archaeological Project, NW                       Honduras.  The project focuses on student conduct of a                          significant independent research project, from the enunciation of               a hypothesis to final write-up, supported by in-field class                     instruction and a living and working situation in which                         interaction among students and research leaders is easy and yet                 intense.  This course of study is founded on the Principal                      Investigator's considerable experience in collaborating with and                instructing undergraduates within field settings in the past, and               especially, on NSF-REU site projects which took place during the                1988 and 1990 Naco Valley seasons.                                                                                                                              Ultimately, the goal for the project is to help students grow                   from neophyte research assistants to junior colleagues confident                in their ability to make independent research decisions and                     contribute to scientific knowledge.  The 1988 and 1990 efforts,                 which form the model of the current program, were successful in                 accomplishing these objectives.",
