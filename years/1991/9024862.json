 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present capability to understand and predict two-phase                      transport for annular flow in complex fin-matrix passages is                    clearly limited by the current lack of information regarding                    the shedding, entrainment and deposition mechanisms in such                     flows.  These studies address this problem specifically by                      examining the manner in which liquid is shed from fin                           structures and the way in which the liquid breaks-up into                       droplets and is dispersed into the core flow.  Microprobe                       instrumentation is being developed to obtain quantitative                       information about local droplet density and size distribution                   downstream of fin structures, and this instrumentation will                     also augment the general capabilities of researchers working                    on multiphase flow transport.  Detailed quantitative                            measurements of the entrainment downstream of fin-type                          structures and lateral transport of liquid between fins and                     prime surface areas, as well as in situ measurements in                         vaporizing and condensing flows in fin matrix passages are                      being made.  These experiments include simultaneous                             measurement of entrainment characteristics and overall heat                     transfer for convective vaporization and condensation of pure                   coolants and binary mixtures over wide ranges of flow                           conditions.  The final stage of the study will use data                         obtained in the experiments to assess and improve existing                      models of shedding, deposition and lateral film transport.                      These improved models will be incorporated into improved                        computational schemes for predicting the overall transport to                   evaluate the impact of these mechanisms on heat and mass                        transfer in the matrix.  The information regarding liquid                       transport mechanisms obtained in the proposed research will                     serve to enhance the capabilities for predicting two-phase                      transport in compact evaporators and condensers, cooling                        towers, and other equipment in which the flow passages are                      complex and/or contain interrupted surfaces.",
