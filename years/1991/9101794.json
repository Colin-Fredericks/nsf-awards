 "awd_abstract_narration": "A flow cytometer will be employed in projects by two major and two              minor users.  1) It will be used to monitor quantitatively the                  progression of differentiation of sea urchin male germ line cells               in culture.  The large number of samples processed will make                    feasible the optimization of culture conditions and the evaluation              of effects of hormones, growth factors, and cell-cell interactions              in promoting production of sperm cell.  2) It will be used to                   characterize mechanisms which maintain lipid asymmetry in normal                and sickled red blood cells, and to probe the resistance of                     cytotoxic T lymphocytes to lysis by their product perforin                      (involved in antigen-specific killing of target cells by the                    mammalian immune system) using the dye merocyanine 540, a                       fluorescent molecule sensitive to lipid asymmetry of live cells.                The minor users will employ the instrument to 3) analyze expression             of cell surface molecules controlled by cell type specific                      promoters in cellular slime molds to study their developmental                  regulation, and 4) analyze as preparation for sorting and                       biochemical analysis of populations of rod outer segment disks from             the mammalian retina as they are processed and discarded with                   aging.",
