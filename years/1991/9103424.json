 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objective of this project is to fully explore the                   \"change-Pumping network (CPN)\" concept, and to transform it into                a very densely integrable family of microelectronic neural                      networks.  The CPN, in its generic form, is the simplest                        interconnected array of MOS gated-diodes.  It is capable of                     performing inner product and thresholding operations in one                     direction and weighted averaging in the opposite in a simultaneous              fashion over the same synaptic matrix.  Yet, no visible feedback                path exists in the array.  This creates a very rich bidirectional               neural functionality in a very compact network.  The research plan              includes the development and refinement of network synthesis                    procedures, a search for self-learning ability and the entire                   design/fab/test cycle for implementing five different target                    architectures.  The goal is to extend the knowledge base in neural              network synthesis by offering a general procedure for non-negative              synaptic matrix design, and to help develop a knowledge base in                 collective multistability Through an analysis of this fundamental               concept.",
