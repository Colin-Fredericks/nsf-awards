The basis for the media is a low density microcellular foam                     process that was developed originally at Sandia National                        Laboratories.  This foam process will be combined with                          electret formation process to create a microcellular electret                   foam filtration media.  The experimental program is directed                    towards gaining insight into the interaction between the                        necessary fabrication processes and the solvent/polymer                         solution required to create the foam and resolution of                          identified problems in the adaptation of the foam to                            filtration applications.  Also, the incorporation of electret                   formation equipment into the fabrication process will be                        investigated.  The knowledge gained will be used to develop a                   set of guidelines for the design and production of a                            microcellular foam filtration media.",
