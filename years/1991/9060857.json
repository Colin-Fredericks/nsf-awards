 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine sponges have been one of the richest sources of bio-                     active compounds. However, the supply of these sponges must                     come from ocean collections.  And with natural collections as                   the basis for drug development, the purity and impurity of the                  final product is difficult to control. Also, Pharmaceutical, or                 agrichemical companies will not continue to develop a promising                 new natural product lead without a secure, reliable supply, or                  an indication of a probable synthesis or analog being                           developed.                                                                                                                                                      A controlled environment aquaculture system is proposed for the                 culture of two tropical marine sponges, for the investigation                   and development of novel techniques for harvesting the high-                    value secondary metabolites produced by these sponges, the                      diterpene antibiotics, the Kalihinols, from  Acanthella                         carvenosa, and the antiparasitic and antibiotic, amino acid-                    derived Bengamides from Jaspis sp.. The objective is to develop                 a reliable source that can deliver production quantities of                     chemically consistent natural products to researchers.",
