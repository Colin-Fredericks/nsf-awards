Membership of COSEPUP and of its panels                     is of the highest quality.  The proposal is the third of                        multi-year requests from COSEPUP to the National Science                        Foundation.                                                                                                                                                     COSEPUP has served for thirty years as a source of high level                   advice to science advisors and other senior government officials.               The current proposal describes the intention of the Committee to                continue to perform S&T policy studies at the broadest levels of                analysis.  While predicting which issues will be taken up by                    COSEPUP are difficult to predict, the following are offered as                  candidates:  conflict of interest, science advice, government                   decision-making for research, technology and trade policy, and                  technology transfer and world security.  COSEPUP studies make                   important contributions to the understanding of major S&T policy                issues, including issues of central concern to NSF.  This award                 will allow COSEPUP to continue this work.",
