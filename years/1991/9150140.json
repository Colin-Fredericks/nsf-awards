 "awd_abstract_narration": "SOUNDPRINT, the weekly half-hour, nationally heard public                  radio documentary series proposes SOUNDPRINT EXPLORES SCIENCE,                  five programs that will make science more understandable and                    accessible to general audiences, with secondary use in                          instructional settings.  SOUNDPRINT proposes three different                    treatments of science:  1) Programs that profile scientists and                 the life of a scientist; 2) A comprehensive examination of a                    long-term science project; and 3) Explorations of issues on the                 frontiers of science.  Two programs will profile scientists to                  illustrate what it is like to live the life of a scientist, how                 she/he became interested in a particular subject, why it is                     important, current research on the subject and scientific                       method.  One program will trace, over time, a scientific                        project: it will be recorded over time and presented in a                       compressed half hour.  Listeners will learn about the                           scientific method, share in the human interest and suspense.                    Two programs will bring listeners the latest  thinking on a                     subject from individuals working on a scientific frontier and                   present it in an engaging, understandable manner.  SOUNDPRINT                   has a successful track record of initial science programming                    within the on-going series.  SOUNDPRINT documentaries combine                   journalistic excellence, personal storytelling and state-of-                    the-art audio production to create compelling programs which                    present issues and ideas in an accessible, memorable way.                       Distributed by the American Public Radio Network, SOUNDPRINT                    reaches over 300,000 listeners each week; cassette copies of                    program reach a broad post-broadcast audience in schools,                       libraries, community centers, youth centers, colleges and                       informal sharing by listeners.",
