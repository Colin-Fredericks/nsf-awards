 "awd_abstract_narration": "The descriptive cyclone model originated by the Norwegian                  school of meteorologists in the second decade of the 20th century               has long served as a cornerstone of weather forecasting in the                  middle latitudes. In this paradigm, a word-girdling boundary zone               between polar and tropical air (the polar front) is the focal line              of action, with waves on this front forming, evolving and dying;                producing typical weather patterns and changes during their                     lifetime. The later development of observational networks extending             through the troposphere, dynamical theorys of jet streams and                   planetary scale waves, and the advent of Numerical Weather Predic-              tion models have both complicated and overshadowed the frontal                  cyclone model. This is due, in part, to the fact that in each case,             the treatment is too coarse-meshed in the horizontal to capture the             narrow frontal zone. More recently, radar and satellite-image                   depiction of mesoscale features associated with cyclones, and the               development of numerical research models with mesoscale resolution,             offers the possibility of describing mid-latitude frontal cyclones              in much finer detail. Mass proposes to use a widely-used mesoscale              model (the MM4 model), together with conventional coarse-grained                operational data sets, to generate detailed quantitative four-                  dimensional descriptions of a sample set of five or six cases of                such cyclones (explosively developing and normally developing                   marine cyclones, a continental cyclone over level terrain, and                  cyclones moving across and to the lee of the Rocky Mountains).                  Analyses of these data sets will include  air trajectory                        computations and sophisticated three-dimensional graphics. Mass                 expects that these analyses will contribute to the establishment of             a new paradigm to modify the useful, but incomplete, Norwegian                  model. This will contribute to the improvement of short-range,                  local weather forecasts and to the development of operational                   versions of numerical mesoscale models.",
