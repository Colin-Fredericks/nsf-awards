 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Initiation Award will investigate novel                           approaches in millimeter wave power combining                                   structures.  Several new network-based and spatial                              power combining structures are proposed.  These                                 circuits can combine the power generated by large                               number of three terminal devices in the millimeter-                             wave region.  The proposed power combining                                      structures are planar and periodic.  These combining                            structures are suitable for wafer scale integration.                            Also a two dimensional power combiner is proposed                               which uses Rucker's multi-device symmetrical                                    oscillator as a second level power combining circuit.                           In this case, more devices can be combined and the                              chip's real state can be used more efficiently.  The                            multiple device-circuit interaction for the proposed                            combiners will be investigated using Kurokawa's                                 method and the criteria for stable operation will be                            determined.  These combiners will be designed and                               fabricated for operation at 35 GHz.  The noise                                  performance, frequency stability, reliability factors,                          effect of higher harmonics and power combining                                  efficiency of the proposed combining structures will                            be determined.",
