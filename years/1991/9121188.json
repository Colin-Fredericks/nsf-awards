On July 3, 1991 the Antarctic Space Analog Program Committee                    reviewed several proposed projects and selected two for funding as              demonstration projects for antarctic space analog program                       demonstration project during the 1992-93 austral summer.                                                                                                        A summary of the statement of work for those two projects follow                this abstract.                                                                                                                                                  A total of $150,000 is recommended for FY 91 funding by NSF/DPP.                This will be matched by $100,000 from NASA.  FY 92 funding will                 also be provided by the two agencies.",
