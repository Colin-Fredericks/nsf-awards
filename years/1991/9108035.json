The objectives of the project are:  1). to measure,                   over an annual cycle, N2O and NO flux from common land use types                in lowland tropical Costa Rica representing a typical cycle of                  land usage: primary forests, active pastures created from these                 forests, abandoned pastures and secondary forests derived from                  abandoned pastures, and 2). to combine field experiments with the               field measurements in objective 1 for determination of the                      importance of factors controlling the rates of these fluxes.                                                                                                    For the additional period of research the project team will 1).                 complete the annual cycle on the land use plots, 2). make                       exploratory measurements of flux rates from other soil and land                 use types in the area to extend the ability to generalize                       results, and 3). carry out laboratory and field experiments that                have been stimulated by earlier our findings.  These experiments                include rain storm simulations in forest sites to determination                 the causes for short-term time dynamics in gas flux from these                  systems, and fertilization experiments in pasture sites to                      determine the causes for lower rates of nitrogen oxide emissions                in those systems compared with the forests.",
