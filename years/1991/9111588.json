 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large tracts of rainforests in Central and South America have been           considered \"virgin,\" the products almost entirely of natural processes.         Significant human impacts on rainforests are thought by many to have            been recent occurrences.  Paleoecological and archeological research is         providing new evidence that substantial human modifications of forested         areas already may have been taking place in centuries before Europeans          settled in the Western Hemisphere.  This project will continue research         on pre-Columbian forest modification already underway in and near the Le        Selva Biological Station in northern Costa Rica.  Pollen grains,                charcoal fragments, and diatoms in sediment cores taken from lakes and          swamps will be analyzed and used to reconstruct histories of natural            vegetation, agricultural plants, and fires in the area.  Among the              research questions to be answered in this project are:  How frequent            were fires in Pre-Columbian forests?  What crops and weeds associated           with farming activity are found in the pollen record, and how does the          presence of those crops and weeds relate to records of fires in the             charcoal record?  How frequently were forests cleared?  Can climatic            shifts be distinguished in the pollen and diatom records?                          This project will contribute new understandings related to the               specific questions listed above and to many other related inquiries.            Because similar types of inquiries are underway at other sites in Latin         America, the results of this project also will contribute to comparative        research aimed at identifying the nature and processes associated with          human and environmental change on a continental scale.  Methodological          advances also will be made, especially the refinement of a new procedure        for automated image analysis to identify charcoal fragments.  Finally,          the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students as members of the        research team will provide excellent opportunities for their education,         and collaboration with Costa Rican investigators should stimulate               scientific development in that nation.",
