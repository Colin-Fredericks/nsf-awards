 "awd_abstract_narration": "In addition to its well-known respiratory function the mammalian                lung plays an important role in regulating a variety of plasma                  hormones and also serves as a highly efficient biological filter                of other blood-born molecules.  The anatomy of the lung is ideally              suited to perform these activities, 1) the entire blood volume                  first passes through the lung before it is divided between the                  other organs, and 2)  the extensive capillary network of the lungs              provide a very large surface for interactions between plasma                    molecules and metabolically active cells.  Previous work in this                laboratory has shown that the fish gill has anatomical features                 identical to the lung and subsequent studies have confirmed that                the gill, like the mammalian lung is able to metabolize circulating             hormones such as angiotensin and the catecholamines, epinephrine                and norepinephrine.  Thus hormone regulation by respiratory organs              developed very early in vertebrate evolution and is not a feature               unique to the lung.                                                                                                                                             The proposed research will further delineate the metabolic                      capabilities of the gill with respect to a variety of important                 cardiovascular hormones including angiotensin, atrial natriuretic               peptides, catecholamines, serotonin and a novel vasoactive peptide              hormone T60K that was recently found in this laboratory.  An                    isolated perfused gill technique has been developed to quantify                 metabolism and identify the important enzymatic steps.  Findings                form these studies will be compared to hormone metabolism in intact             fish to further identify the over-all importance of the gill in                 hormone regulation.  In addition, preliminary screening will be                 done on the ability of the gill to metabolize foreign compounds                 such as those found in polluted environments.  Isolation and                    culture of pillar cells, endothelial cells unique to the gill, will             also be done to permit cell-specific metabolic activity.                                                                                                        Results form this research will be important to endocrinologists                and physiologists interested in endocrine control mechanisms and                the phylogenetic development of the vascular endothelium as a                   metabolic organ.  These results are also important because they                 provide the initial direction for further work on the ability of                the gill to metabolize toxic substances, the latter delivered to                the gill via the blood or the environment.//",
