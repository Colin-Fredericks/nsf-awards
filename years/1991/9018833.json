First, the investigator will characterize the host specificity of               viruses that have been isolated and which infect eukaryotic and                 prokaryotic phytoplankton.  Each of the viral isolates will be                  screened against a large number of potential hosts with close and               distant phylogenetic relationships, to the original host.                       Second, the temporal variability of a virus which infects                       Synechococcus sp. will be determined monthly in natural waters by               plaque assay.  Third, Dr. Suttle will determine the decay rates                 (turnover times) in natural waters of three viruses which have                  been isolated and developed plaque assays for.  Fourth, the                     effect of natural virus communities on phytoplankton productivity               and community structure will be ascertained.  Almost nothing is                 known about viruses which infect marine phytoplankton; yet, data                included in this proposal suggests that viruses are important and               can affect rates of carbon fixation.  This research will answer                 fundamental questions concerning phytoplankton-virus interactions               and persistence of infectious viruses in the sea.  Only studies                 such as these will provide the requisite data to enable                         incorporation of viral-mediated processes into comprehensive                    models of nutrient and energy cycling in the global oceans.",
