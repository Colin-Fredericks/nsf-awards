The focus of the                        meeting will be on various aspects of zeolite catalysis,                        including zeolite synthesis, characterization, adsorptive                       properties, and diffusion phenomena in zeolites.                                Approximately 12 Indian scientists will participate and                         discuss recent research results with the U.S. participants.                     Formal presentations will be supplemented with time for                         informal discussions.  Areas for research will be identified                    where new initiatives may be jointly made.  A report of the                     meeting will be distributed to members of the Catalysis                         Society in the U.S. and Canada and to the members of the                        Catalysis Society of India.                                                                                                                                     Scope:  The proposed workshop is organized in India by                          Dr. T.S.R. Prasada Rao, Secretary of the Catalysis Society of                   India, with support from the president of the society,                          Dr. S.K. Patil of the Department of Chemistry at the Indian                     Institute of Technology in Madras.  The topic is of                             fundamental scientific importance and has significant                           practical applications in the U.S. and India.  The workshop                     is likely to enhance U.S.-India scientific collaboration.",
