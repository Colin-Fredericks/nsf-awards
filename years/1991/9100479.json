The activity will run for eight weeks during the summer                 of 1991.  Students will be assigned individual faculty advisors                 and will work on projects closely allied with those of interest                 to the advisor.  To foster interactions between students, they                  will be housed together.  In addition, frequent progress reports                will be given by students to the entire team.                                        There will be a rich variety of research topics.  These                    include work on modeling uncertainty in economics, the wave and                 Euler partial differential equations, the geometry of orbits of                 linear groups and computer gaming.  All students will be briefed                on the use of mathematical software available, such as                          Mathmatica, Macsyma and Maple.  Reports at the conclusion of the                project will be required.                                                            All of the faculty are currently involved in high-level                    mathematical research; this should add considerable currency to                 the impressions made on the undergraduates.  It should be pointed               out that the Mathematics Department of Indiana University has a                 long history of conducting summer programs designed to give                     mathematics majors research experience.  They started in the                    early 1970's, continuing until 1981 with support from the NSF                   Undergraduate Research Participation Program.",
