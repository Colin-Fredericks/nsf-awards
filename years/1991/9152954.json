 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to equip an archaeology laboratory for                        undergraduate teaching at Carleton College. 50 students will                    use this laboratory  each year, in two archaeology classes, in                  conjunction with field programs, and for independent student                    research in association with a new interdisciplinary                            archaeology program.  A space for the laboratory has already                    been approved and many pieces of equipment either have been                     donated to the laboratory or can be borrowed from existing                      programs at Carleton.  The major equipment requested in this                    grant include the materials necessary to build two artificial                   archaeological sites in the lab and the computer equipment and                  software needed by students to analyze archaeological materials                 and sites.  By using the modern computer-assisted-design (CAD)                  capabilities of the computer and its accessories, as well as                    other software, students can integrate all facets of practical                  archaeology, from curating and drawing artifacts, to generating                 site plans, topographic maps, and sections, to interpreting                     patterns of ancient settlements.  There are no comparable                       facilities on the Carleton campus for these purposes.",
