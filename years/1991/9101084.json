 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to develop and evaluate control strategies for insect-                 vectored plant pathogens, in agroecosystems, both vector                        population dynamics and behavioral ecology must be understood.                  While many studies have examined insect population dynamics and                 mortality due to natural enemies, few have studied the impact of                natural enemies on the movement behavior of insect vectors.  This               is true despite demonstrations that both predaceous and parasitic               natural enemies can affect vector movement, that the resulting                  change in vector movement behavior can increase disease spread,                 and despite the ongoing USDA project to release natural enemies                 for aphid control in grains throughout the Western US.  We will                 compare the impact of a predator (Coccinella septempunctata a                   beetle) and a parasitoid (Aphidius sp., a wasp) of the major                    aphid vector (Rhopalosiphum padi) on the spread of barley yellow                dwarf virus which affects small grains worldwide.  This study                   will develop mechanistic models of insect-vectored plant disease                and compare model predictions with experimental results.  There                 are no mechanistic models of insect-vectored plant disease, and                 such models will assist in evaluating the disease consequences of               biological control strategies using easily observed behavioral                  parameters of the organisms involved.  The research will test                   model hypotheses by confining natural enemies in plots of oats in               the field and measure aphid movement, aphid mortality, and                      disease incidence.",
