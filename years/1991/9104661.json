 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with three projects in                          algebraic K-theory.  The first is a continuation of previous                    work on the K-theory of twisted forms of reductive group                        schemes, with the goal of computing a part of the K-cohomology                  of such schemes.  The second project is to use this                             computation of the K-theory of group schemes to get a good                      description of the K-theory of homogeneous spaces for                           reductive groups, and their twisted forms.  The third project                   is an investigation of some constructions in motivic                            cohomology.                                                                          This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory.  In                    a broad sense algebraic K-theory concerns the evolution of                      concepts from linear algebra such as basis and vector space.                    This work has significant implications for number theory and                    algebraic geometry, and promises to make exciting connections                   between a number of different areas in mathematics.",
