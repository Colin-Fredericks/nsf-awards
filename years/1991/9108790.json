 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the proposed research are (1) to develop a               systematic, computerized procedure to detect the structural                     patterns in the grassland landscape of Jasper Ridge, California,                based primarily on the 2-Dimensional Net Function Interpolation                 Theory; (2) to construct and validate a hierarchically                          structured, spatially explicit, stochastic simulation model of                  pattern-process dynamics, based mainly on data from the Jasper                  Ridge grassland ecosystem.  The model will take into                            consideration processes involving small-scale/high frequency,                   middle-scale/low frequency, and large-scale/very low frequency                  phenomena.  Stochasticity in each process will have to be                       incorporated.  Large-scale phenomena may include weather                        fluctuations (e.g., precipitation, temperature), wind/water                     erosion, prolonged drought, and irregularly timed, fires.  Small-               scale phenomena, on the other hand, may involve physical                        environmental patchiness and activities of mound-building animals               such as gophers and ants.  Overall, the model will incorporate                  demographics of small-scaled disturbances in grasslands, monitor                the temporal changes of patches, and trace aging and extinction                 of the patches at various scales.  The spatially explicit,                      multiple-scale pattern induction model takes a bottom-up                        approach, deriving landscape-level dynamics of the grassland from               that of hierarchically decomposable lower levels.  The                          computational demand in spatial and temporal statistical analyses               of patterns, and the sensitivity anaLysis and Monte Carlo                       simulation of the model, will make desirable and imperative the                 use of the parallel capabilities of the supercomputer facilities.               The completion of the proposed study will add substantially to                  understanding of the role of naturally occurring disturbances at                various scales in creating the pattern-process dynamics, provide                a modeling framework for further comparative investigation on                   different types o grassland ecosystems, serve as a strong basis                 for comparing grasslands with forests, and exemplify the                        significance of supercomputer facilities in enhancing ecological                understanding.",
