 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses tools and methods of statistical mechanics to                 introduce a unified computational approach to analyze the performance           of large-scale multiprocessor systems.  The aim is to derive a small            amount of \"macroscopic\" information about system (thermodynamic)                averages, despite the vast complexity of \"microscopic\" interactions             (a \"microscopic\" theory dealing with interactions of each processor             with other system components is likely to overwhelm the user with               detail and fail to adequately understand the system behavior - this is          analogous of studying the trajectory of each molecule of a gas when             we are interested in steady-state averages).  Therefore, it seems               natural that the complexity existing in multiprocessor systems is the           sort of complexity that ought to yield to some sort of treatment                analogous to statistical mechanics.                                                                                                                             The approach is to use a physical analogy between the execution of a            parallel algorithm on a multiprocessor system and a physical system to          obtain fast approximation methods for the performance analysis of               concurrency.  An approach to analyze critical phenomena (\"hot spots\")           in large multiprocessor systems is suggested by analogy to critical             phase transitions in physics.  The results will be compared with                extensive measurements and simulations on a multiprocessor to provide           empirical evidence for the viability of the approach.  Success in this          effort would mean the establishment of a general and unified approach           for a \"macroscopic\": description and analysis of multiprocessor                 performance.",
