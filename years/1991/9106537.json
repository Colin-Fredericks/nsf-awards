 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Roman Jackiw,                        Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,                   to pursue with Dr. Choonkyu Lee, Department of Physics, Seoul                   National University, for a period of 24 months, a program of                    cooperative research on physics in (2+1) dimensions.  Major                     effort will be given to studying classical and quantum                          aspects of gauge field theories with the Chern-Simons term                      and of (2+1)-dimensional Einstein gravity.  By generalizing                     recent work done by themselves and others, the col-                             laborators will attempt to expand knowledge about physical/                     mathematical properties of non-trivial classical solutions,                     e.g., vortex solutions, in these theories.  Physics in two or                   three space-time dimensions should be significantly simpler                     than that of the four-dimensional world.  A hopelessly                          difficult four-dimensional problem may become easily managed                    in lower dimensions.  Three-dimensional field theories, to be                   studied in this research, also may have possible physical                       applications.  Drs. Jackiw and Lee are highly respected                         scientists in the field of the research.  They have an                          impressive record of successful collaboration.                                                                                                                  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea                    Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the                         level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and                     engineers through the exchange of scientific information,                       ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on                      problems of mutual benefit.  Dr. Lee's participation in the                     project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering                       Foundation (KOSEF).",
