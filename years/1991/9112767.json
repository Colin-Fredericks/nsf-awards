 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is co-funded between the Materials Theory and the                    Biophysics programs at NSF.  Several topics in condensed matter                 physics will be investigated.  The primary emphasis will be on gel              electrophoresis, a topic of great importance in biology and                     materials processing.  The electrophoresis of very long chain                   polymers such as megabase length DNA is still not well understood.              There are still many unexplained experimental effects that greatly              reduce the efficacy of this technique.  These effects will be                   explored theoretically in consultation with experimentalists.  A                newly developed long range Monte Carlo algorithm will be used and               will include the effects of gel heterogeneity and intra-chain                   repulsion.  Work will also be undertaken on the effect of polymers              on turbulent flow by extending an analytical treatment developed by             the principal investigator to more realistic descriptions of the                velocity field.  Research will also be conducted on novel random                matrix ensembles and their connection with the quantum statistical              properties of isolated systems.                                                 %%%                                                                             Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is an experimental technique used              to separate DNA molecules containing up to two million base pairs.              This discovery was a critical factor in making the human genome                 project possible.  DNA can be viewed as a polymer and the                       methodology of polymer science can be applied to studies of the                 behavior of DNA in an electric field.  The present grant will                   continue fundamental and critical studies on theoretical and                    computational aspects of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.  Such                studies help in interpreting the experimental results and in                    predicting useful behavior of this important technique.",
