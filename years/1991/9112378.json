 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of very high pressures to modify reaction                               kinetics and thermodynamics is a well known                                     concept that has been rarely used in the context of                             thin film growth.  In this proposal we request                                  partial funding for the acquisition of a high                                   pressure reactor system for the synthesis of thin                               film oxides at growth pressures as high as 20,000                               psi.  This facility will allow us to expand the scope                           and enhance current research into high pressure                                 thin film oxidation synthesis.  Preliminary                                     experiments have shown that high pressure                                       oxidation processing allows the use of much lower                               processing temperatures which minimize                                          interactions between substrate materials and thin                               film overlayers.  In one project, we have                                       demonstrated the utility of this technique for the                              passivation of Group IV heterostructure                                         semiconductor systems.  It also represents a novel                              method for the synthesis of oxide thin films for                                optical, electronic, ferroelectric, and                                         superconducting applications.",
