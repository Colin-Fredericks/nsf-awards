 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a 3-year major portion of the inventory of all                          caterpillars, their host plant relationships, and their parasitoids             in the tropical dry forest of the Guanacaste Conservation Area in               northwestern Costa Rica.  The inventory results are designed to                 make caterpillars and their trophic relationships with food plants              and parasitoids available to basic studies in ecology, systematics,             behavior, physiology and evolution, and to applied users in natural             products chemistry, education, and pest management.  The overall                goal is to establish this biological system as an integral part of              the non-destructive sustainable use of a complex tropical wildland              by science and by Costa Rican society.  Specifically, this project              will accomplish the following.                                                                                                                                  Locate, rear and characterize the caterpillars of a minimum of                  another 500 species of macromoths (and some butterflies), and a                 minimum of another 335 species of microlepidoptera, so as to yield              a total of approximately 1450 species characterized for this                    forest.  This is approximately half of its caterpillar fauna.  All              information will be stored in computerized data bases;                                                                                                          Maintain and enlarge the current collecting of voucher material for             all rearings, and increase the number of duplicates so as to be                 able to easily donate specimens to studies of taxonomy and                      morphology of caterpillars and pupae;                                                                                                                           Publish field guides in Spanish and English to the caterpillars of              this forest, family by family, as the rearing for each family is                complete or nearly so;                                                                                                                                          Publish survey papers listing the host plant records for all of                 the species reared, papers listing the parasitoids reared from the              caterpillars collected in the field and papers on caterpillars and              parasitoid natural history.",
