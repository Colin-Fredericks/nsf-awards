The objective of the report is to make this                work known and accessible to a broad class of mathematical                      scientists (particularly graduate students and new Ph.D.'s) for                 the purpose of increasing the participation of mathematical                     scientists in this area of research.  Secondary objectives are to               create a useful reference to this work for biologists and to make               the fruits of this collaboration more broadly known and                         appreciated in the scientific community.                                             The project will produce a report on the significant                       contributions, open problems, and likely future directions of                   mathematical sciences research and methods applied to problems in               molecular biology, especially recent intensive work in the areas                of genome and protein structure research.
