 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports Dr. Draine's research on several topics within              the area of theoretical astrophysics of diffuse interstellar                    matter.  The topics include: (A) excitation of interstellar                     molecular hydrogen, with the aim of being able to calculate                     accurately the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium excitation of                and emission from molecular hydrogen under various conditions; (B)              structure of non-stationary photodissociation fronts, including                 both stationary and propagating fronts, with the aim of being able              to predict detailed emission spectra; and (C) interstellar magneto-             hydrodynamic shock waves in both diffuse and dense clouds,                      including study of the non-linear development of instabilities in               magneto-hydrodynamic shocks.                                                                                                                                    (A) As the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium,                   molecular hydrogen is a critical diagnostic for regions of warm                 molecular gas such as photodissociation regions and shock fronts.               It is essential to have accurate theoretical calculations of the                spectrum of collisionally excited molecular hydrogen.  (B) It has               recently become clear that time-dependent photodissociation fronts              are of major importance.  The neglect of gas flow through such a                front is a major limitation of current models, and Dr. Draine will              attempt to rectify this defect.  (C) One of the highlights of                   interstellar astrophysics of the last decade, the determination of              the spectra of shocks in molecular gas, is in gross disagreement                with observation.  Dr. Draine's course of study should help to                  eliminate this discrepancy.",
