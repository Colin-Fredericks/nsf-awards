The Network is holding a two-day                 Workshop for Expanding Your Horizons (EYH), day long conferences                for girls, coordinators.  The objectives of the Workshop are:                   establish direct communication between coordinators throughout the              country;  to encourage each coordinator to act as mentor to a new               conference site; to teach coordinators how to develop broad-based               community support;  to identify the kinds of help EYH coordinators              need; and to strengthen EYH coordinators' planning skills.",
