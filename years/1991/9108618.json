 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the remaining gaps in the quantitative record of U.S.                    economic history is detailed information on the fiscal activities               of state and local governments.  Annual time-series data on federal             revenues and expenditures are available from 1789 on, but similar               information on state and local governments is sparse, particularly              before 1900.  This project will close the statistical gap by                    developing annual time series of revenues and expenditures for each             state, and decennial estimates for the revenues and expenditures                of local governments, supplemented by a separate series of large                cities.  These series will indicate overall levels of fiscal                    activity as well as the sources and uses of funds.  State                       documents, published and unpublished, will furnish the basis for                the complete state-level series.  Local government estimates are                based on a sampling procedure.                                                                                                                                  The results of this project will include an analysis of the fiscal              history of state and local government.  The data base created                   during the course of this project will be made publicly available               through the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social                 Research.  This data base is invaluable because it will establish               for the first time a solid, quantitative basis for estimating the               overall share of government in the economy throughout U.S. history              and the role of government in the nation's development.",
