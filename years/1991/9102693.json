 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists and engineers are an underutilized resource in                  motivating students and assisting classroom teachers in                         teaching science.  Pilot programs have demonstrated the value                   of preparing scientists for what to expect when they enter the                  classroom, how to incorporate the school curriculum into their                  program, and how best to reach the goal of making their visits                  a \"never to be forgotten\" life changing experience for                          students.  The concept of a Survival Kit is an outgrowth of a                   Scientist-in-Residence program at the North Carolina Museum of                  Life and Science which has successfully matched scientists and                  public school classrooms locally since 1982.                                                                                                                         The North Carolina Museum of Life and Science proposes to                  conduct meetings for staff and outside educational specialists                  to identify the materials and strategies needed to prepare                      scientists to enter school classrooms.  The final report of                     these meetings will include mechanicals of a Scientist Survival                 Kit, which can be disseminated across the country, and an                       evaluation report of how the kits can be and are used.                                                                                                               Dr. Mark St. John, Inverness Associates, a professional                    evaluator noted for his work with nationally significant                        science education projects, will provide local and national                     evaluation through surveys and meetings to give a picture of                    the issues involved in establishing and maintaining programs of                 scientists in the schools and the role played by the                            Scientist's Survival Kit in furthering this aim.",
