 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the ecological and economic importance of vertebrate                    suspension feeders, hypotheses about particle entrapment                        mechanisms inside their oral cavities have rarely been tested                   and the fluid mechanics of filtration  by vertebrates has not                   been modelled.  This project will develop a mathematical model                  of flow fields around and particle retention by the gill raker                  of blackfish (Cyprinidae), and will apply this model to                         Pacific herring (Clupeidae) and northern anchovy (Engraulidae).                 Using a fiberoptic endoscope and thermistor flow probe to                       record the first images and  water velocities inside the oral                   cavity of a vertebrate suspension feeder, an unexpected                         filtration mechanism was documented in blackfish.  Gill rakers,                 assumed to be the site of particle retention in fishes, act in                  blackfish as barriers that direct particle-laden water to the                   mucus-covered oral roof.  A thermistor flow probe will provide                  empirical values for the model parameters in herring and                        anchovy, and a fiberoptic endoscope will establish whether the                  model accurately predicts the pattern of flow at the rakers.                    The model will indicate the flow velocities and raker                           morphologies that are associated with the functioning of rakers                 as barriers versus filters, and will be applicable to a                         diversity of fish species and other suspension feeders.",
