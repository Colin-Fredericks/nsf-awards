 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite a major focus on nitrogen as the limiting nutrient in                   marine ecosystems, there is evidence that in some marine                        environments, especially the vast oligotrophic central gyres,                   that phosphate appears to be refractory and potentially                         limiting, although a fraction of the phosphate pool does appear                 to turn over rapidly.  Dissolved nucleic acids will be examined                 as a model component of this rapidly-cycling fraction, because                  many of the breakdown rates and the concentrations of the                       resulting intermediates can be measured.  These parameters will                 be measured by a combination of fluorometric, isotopic, and                     spectrophotometric techniques and will be compared to parallel                  measurement of the major phosphate pools and fluxes. This project               will test the hypotheses that microbial breakdown of                            dissolved nucleic acids is both: 1) a quantitatively important                  pathway, and 2) a model pathway for the cycling of labile                       dissolved organic phosphate in the oligotrophic North Atlantic.                 This research will further our understanding of the cycling of                  dissolved organic phosphate, a suite of compounds with                          potentially global importance to marine primary production.                     Furthermore, this research will lead to insights into microbial                 processes of biopolymer and monomer breakdown.  Finally, since                  dissolved nucleic acids are genetic material and also significant               reservoirs of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, these                      studies will increase our knowledge of environmental gene                       transfer and of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen cycling in                the environment.",
