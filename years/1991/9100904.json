 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chesapeake Bay Institute of Johns Hopkins University will                   provide shipboard technical services associated with the                        research vessel RIDGLEY WARFIELD, a 110-foot ship that is                       owned by the NSF and operated by the University.  A                             significant portion of the ship's operating schedule in                         recent years has been and is normally in support of NSF-                        sponsored research programs.  The Shipboard Technician                          Program has two components: an at-sea component and an ashore                   component.                                                                                                                                                      The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                         personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;                             maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific                              instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck                            operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming                     and off-going scientific parties.  On shore activities                          include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared                      use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in                    preparing for field work on the vessel.  Shipboard                              technicians funded by this award have broad responsibilities                    for providing the coordination and assistance needed for the                    successful completion of research projects at sea.  The level                   of activity and amount of support are closely related to the                    size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                    and capability.",
