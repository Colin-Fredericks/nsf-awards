 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to significantly upgrade the                   laboratory experience of engineering undergraduates in the area                 of composites manufacture and testing.  The core of the                         Composites Engineering Multidisciplinary Certificate Program is                 a four course sequence culminating with the integrating, hands-                 on experience of the laboratory course.  The equipment provides                 students experience in three crucial technologies used in                       industry.  A resin transfer molding experiment allows students                  to study reaction kinetics and the effect of flow dynamics on                   final part quality.  The multi-axis, computer-controlled                        filament winding machine allows the students to design,                         analyze, and fabricate complex parts in a paperless, automated                  environment.  An upgrade to an ultrasonic testing device,                       consisting of a computerized data acquisition and analysis                      system, allows the students to more accurately detect flaws in                  the parts that they have fabricated during the term.  The                       laboratory provides a quality, state-of-the-art experience for                  approximately 200 students.  Implementation has a substantial                   long-term effect on the students' laboratory experience and                     better equips them to assume leadership roles in the field of                   advanced materials design and manufacturing.",
