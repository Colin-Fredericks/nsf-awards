 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in biological                    oceanography between Dr. Edward Carpenter, State University                     of New York at Stony Brook, and Dr. Birgitta Bergman,                           Institute of Physiological Botany, University of Uppsala,                       Sweden.  The objective of the proposed research is to study                     the physiology of nitrogen fixation in the pelagic                              cyanobacterium Trichodesmium.                                                                                                                                   This organism is significant in the biology of the world's                      oceans as a major contributor of new nitrogen to tropical                       and subtropical seas.  In the proposed project, Dr.                             Carpenter will study advanced techniques on enzyme                              localization, molecular biology and electron microscopy in                      order to address major unresolved questions concerning this                     enigmatic organism, in particular, how this non-heterocystous                   colony is able to fix nitrogen during the day under aerobic                     conditions. He will focus on:  1) the location and abundance                    of the enzyme nitrogenase through diel cycles, 2) the                           localization and abundance of N transforming enzymes GS and                     GOGAT, with the goal of understanding how fixed nitrogen is                     transferred from diazotrophic cells to vegetative cells, 3)                     the location of oxygen protective enzymes, such as uptake                       hydrogenases and superoxide dismutase, and 4) the location                      of other proteins involved in photosynthesis.  The two                          major Trichodesmium species, erythraeum and thiebautii,                         will be contrasted. The research will be carried out                            through the study of Trichodesmium samples at the Institute                     of Physiological Botany in Uppsala, jointly with Dr.                            Bergman.  The complementary expertise of the two                                investigators in immuno-localization at the LM and TEM                          level of key proteins in cynobacteria will contribute to                        the success of the proposed project.",
