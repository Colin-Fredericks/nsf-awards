 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Houston-Clear Lake for the repair and renovation of               the Bayou Building which houses biological research and research                training activities.  This building was constructed in 1975 and                 has not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of                     $125,000 and $155,146 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will              be used to modernize these research and research training                       facilities and will permit the clustering of faculty members who                are now dispersed or who currently have no assigned laboratory                  space.  This project will address the need to improve the current               research infrastructure by providing more usable space, adequate                ventilation and lighting, and growth chambers for all laboratories              which are to be modernized.  The greater interactions among faculty             and students that accrue from this renovation can be expected to                enhance collaborations and the quality of ongoing research.                                                                                                     This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality students in a department with a                     particular commitment to educating nontraditional students and to               preparing students for advanced education in the sciences.",
