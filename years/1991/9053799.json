 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Arizona will carry out a project for                          preparing teachers of secondary science and mathematics.  As                    is the case in many large research-oriented institutions, the                   university previously had not capitalized on its resources                      and faculty to produce significant numbers of secondary                         teachers.  Under this project, a close-knit alliance of                         scientists, mathematicians, educators, and teachers will                        develop a coordinated curriculum that integrates education in                   the content areas with pedagogical preparation.  The program                    will include rigorous content-area courses, subject-specific                    pedagogical courses, a range of practice teaching situations,                   and paid summer internships in research laboratories.                           Special attention will be given to recruiting and retaining                     minorities.  Throughout the program the students' interest in                   teaching will be nurtured and encouraged by careful advising,                   close supervision, and follow-up during the first years of                      teaching.  The University's cost sharing will be 25% of NSF's                   support.",
