 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will contribute to the understanding of the                       relationship of microscopic structure of teeth and  their                       function.  Specifically the research will focus on differenrtial                molar wear in six, related forms of lemurid primates.  While                    these species are related, they evidence clear differences in                   dietary practices and hence reflect the impact of food choice on                dental wear.                                                                                                                                                    At a microscopic level, the molar teeth of lemurids are composed                of enamel prisms bundled into crystallites separated from                       differently oriented crystallites by discontinuities called prism               boundaries.  The boundaries are sources of differential wear, as                is the orietation of the prism axis relative to the wear surface.               Wear patterns can be determined from scanning electron                          micrographs of teeth from cadavers at the Duke University Primate               Center.                                                                                                                                                         Within the Lemurids, there is significant variation in molar                    morphology which impacts each species' ability to shear                         foodstuffs.  Maas will test whether the gross morphological                     differences are paralleled by differences in the microstructure.                This is an aspect of primate dental evolution which has been                    largely unexplored.  Clarifying this issue will assist in                       interpreting the primate fossil record.",
