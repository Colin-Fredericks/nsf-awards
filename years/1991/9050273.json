 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Southern Mississippi has designed a project                   in which teams of three primary grade (K-3) and three                           intermediate grade (4-6) elementary teachers from each of                       twelve Mississippi public school districts will be selected                     to participate in two successive three-week summer workshops                    over the next two years. These workshops are designed to                        prepare 216 teachers in the use hands-on science activities                     in their classrooms.  The project has a two-fold purpose, (1)                   to enable the teachers to use these activities in their                         classroom in order to stimulate the interest of children in                     learning science and (2a) to equip the teacher with the                         necessary content knowledge base to teach science.  Although                    chemistry will be used as the science content theme, the                        concepts, ideas and activities developed in these workshops                     are applicable to all science teaching at the elementary grade                  level.  It is assumed that participants will not have a                         background in chemistry.                                                                                                                                        The project faculty will model an approach in which concrete                    manipulation of objects is the mechanism for obtaining data                     for mental processing into abstract statements of patterns and                  relationships.  The participants will actually work through                     each of the many activities, which have chosen for their                        usefulness in the classroom, their low cost, their use of                       readily available materials, and their safety.  Each                            participant will gin experience with these activities by                        teaching in a special summer class for grade school children.                   In addition to receiving three hours of graduate credit, each                   participant must share what they have learned by participating                  and conducting hands-on in-service workshops with the support                   of the project staff.  A high school chemistry teachers and                     an administrator from each school district will be a member                     of the team during the entire project including the follow-                     up and evaluation phase.                                                                                                                                        In the course of this project and its immediate predecessor,                    thirty-six school districts in Mississippi will be impacted                     directly, affecting one-fourth of all the districts in the                      state.  An amount equivalent to 25% of the NSF request is                       being cost-shared by USM and the twelve school districts.",
