 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop a relative Hodge theory of                      families of complex algebraic varieties.  More precisely, there is              associated to any variety a category of objects called stratified               variations of Hodge structure.  Given an algebraic map, the data of             the cohomology along the fibers together with their mixed Hodge                 structures should give rise to such an object.  The principal                   investigator will examine this situation, as well as consider the               category of polarizable mixed Hodge structures.                                      This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, which is              one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics.  In its origin, it               treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest              equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of                 methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology.             It is finding application in those areas of mathematics as well as              in theoretical computer science and in robotics.",
