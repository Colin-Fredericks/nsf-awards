The P.I. intends to study comparisons across generations within                 the Mexican and Mexican-Americans cultural groups. It has been                  identified that Mexican and Mexican-Americans have the highest                  fertility rate in the U.S. and are projected to comprise the                    majority of the population in certain parts of the country by                   the end of the century. Information regarding the early                         socialization practices of Mexican and Mexican-Americans would                  provide valuable assistance to social scientists and                            practitioners interested in understanding how cultural                          background interacts with early experiences to influence                        developmental outcome in children. Prior research has pointed                   out that one of the most important factors affecting a child's                  development is the quality of the mother-infant attachment                      relationship. Attachment has been defined as an affectional tie                 that one person develops with another person that transcends                    time and space.  The goal of the attachment relationship is                     that of felt security in the infant. The development of a                       secure attachment is thought to encourage exploratory                           behavior, promote social competence with peers, and assist with                 the development of ego resiliency by school age.  The proposed                  study intends to build upon Beckwith and Cohen's findings on                    attachment by comparing and contrasting the quality of the                      mother-infant relationship and security attachment.",
