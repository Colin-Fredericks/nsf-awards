 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to continue the PI's research program on the                antecedents and prediction of divorce.  The PI's previous work                  investigated the causes and prevention of marital distress.  In                 this earlier work, the PI found that males' withdrawal from                     conflict was the best predictor of divorce.  The present work                   will follow the PI's earlier research respondents into their                    child rearing stage, to see how marital distress affects                        children.  The research will assess the relation between affect                 regulation in marriage and in the parent child relationship (how                is withdrawal in the marriage related to withdrawal from the                    child?).  The effects of children on marital satisfaction and                   interaction also will be examined.                                                                                                                              In addition, divorced spouses will also be studied in their new                 relationships, to determine if dysfunctional patterns are                       repeated in second marriages.                                                                                                                                   This research is focused on a critically important issue for                    American society.  It is theory based, rigorous, and beautifully                designed.  Markman has proved himself in this arena, and deserves               further funding.",
