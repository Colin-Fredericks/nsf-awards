 "awd_abstract_narration": "Primates have a long period of immaturity between weaning and                   adulthood, and during this time juveniles continue to maintain a                close relationship with their mothers.  Behavioral observations                 from Dr. Fairbanks' captive colony of vervet monkeys indicate                   that the mother provides social and physical support to her                     juvenile offspring.                                                                                                                                             This research was designed to determine how juveniles compensate                for the loss of their mother and how they develop in her absence.               Juvenile orphans are observed in their natal social group for a                 period of two years following removal of their mothers, and the                 behavior and social relationships of the orphans are compared                   with that of other juveniles whose mothers are still living in                  the groups.  The juveniles being studied were born in the colony                and information is already available about their early                          relationships with their mothers.  Dr. Fairbanks is testing                     specific predictions from a model of compensatory response to                   mother-loss based on the assumption that the juvenile will not                  just react passively to the loss, but instead will actively try                 to replace the benefits that would have been provided by the                    mother.  The model predicts that the behavioral deficiencies                    associated with being orphaned should be related to reduced self-               confidence and increased need for self-protection, and that the                 incidence of these deficiencies should be influenced by the                     nature of the orphan's prior relationship with its mother, and by               the orphan's ability to form compensatory relationships with                    appropriate individuals.                                                                                                                                        The results of this research will contribute to a growing base of               information about the significance of continued maternal                        investment in offspring long after the period of early infant                   dependency across different animal species.  They will increase                 our understanding of how management of captive colonies                         influences animal welfare.  The model being tested also has                     relevance for understanding the problems associated with adoption               and parent loss for human children.",
