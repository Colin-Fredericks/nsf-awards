 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is on the contractile apparatus                    responsible for cytokinesis in animal cells.  The goals are to                  understand how actin and myosin are assembled into the                          contractile units that form the cleavage furrow, and to determine               how these units are attached to the cell membrane.  Fluorescent                 analogues of actin, myosin, talin, and vinculin will be injected                into living cells and their incorporation into cleavage furrows                 analyzed.  The kinetics of assembly and disassembly of actin and                myosin in the furrow will be measured and specific inhibitors                   introduced to test the hypothesis that the two proteins are                     recruited co-temporaneously but independently of one another.                   Short term incorporation of fluorescent actin and myosin                        analogues during mitosis will be measured to determine if actin                 and myosin are incorporated preferentially into the equatorial                  cortex.  Inhibitors of talin and vinculin will be introduced into               mitotic cells to test the idea that these proteins play a role in               attaching actin filaments to the cleavage furrow membrane.                      Photoactivation and photobleaching of actin and myosin analogues                will be used to determine if there is a cortical flow of actin                  and myosin from the poles to the equatorial cortex to form the                  cleavage furrow.                                                                                                                                                The significance of the proposed experiments lies in their                      potential for describing how actin and myosin are assembled into                the contractile apparatus that is essential for one of the most                 basic of biological processes:  cell division.",
