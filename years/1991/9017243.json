 "awd_abstract_narration": "Assimilation of sulfate-S is a central event in plant metabolism                and the formation of organosulfur compounds such as amino acids,                cofactors, and sulfolipid by the plant.  The research planned is                focused on sulfate activation that takes place on the inner                     mitochrondrial membrane of Euglena and the presumed, subsequent                 transfer of activated S in some form to the chloroplast.  A                     critical assessment of sulfite's involvement in sulfolipid                      formation is another focus of this research.  The flow of sulfur                compounds from mitochondria to chloroplasts is an important part                of understanding the origin of chloroplast components during                    plastid development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The metabolic intermediates involved in conversion of assimilated               sulfate into the variety of S-containing compounds characteristic               of plant biomass are, in significant details, unclear; the research             planned is directed at understanding the extent to which sulfite                is an actual intermediate in such conversions, and at enlarging the             understanding of how a key enzyme involved in sulfate reduction                 functions in cysteine biosynthesis.  This flow of sulfur is an                  important aspect of plastid development in plant growth.",
