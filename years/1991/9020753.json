 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the potential for disruption of human and economic                  activities, precipitation characteristics of winter-time                        cyclones are of great practical as well as scientific interest.                 It has been known for some time that the heaviest precipitation                 from these systems occurs in relatively narrow precipitation                    bands.                                                                               Over the past several years, the organization of                           precipitation bands in cyclonic storms has received a great deal                of attention with a variety of physical mechanisms being                        proposed to explain the characteristics of these bands.  Most of                the previous observational studies of bandedness in winter                      cyclonic storms have been conducted in coastal regions which                    experience quite different meteorological conditions than the                   mid-continental area.                                                                Previously, the Principal Investigators were involved in                   field experiments to collect data on these winter-time banded                   structures.  The field projects included advanced                               instrumentation such as Doppler radar and wind profiling system.                The Principal Investigators will continue their analysis of this                observational data and expand their research to contain a                       numerical modelling component.  Primary objectives will be to                   describe the physical characteristics and mesoscale organization                of precipitation bands and to isolate the dynamic mechanisms                    responsible for the formation and evolution of the bands.",
