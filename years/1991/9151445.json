 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated wind tunnel and data acquisition laboratory which                 allows undergraduate mechanical and aerospace engineering                       students to study aspects of classical and modern aerodynamics                  is established. The laboratory includes a low turbulence wind                   tunnel which is designed for experiments involving both laminar                 flows and flows which are in the process of transition to                       turbulence. Facilities which can produce the high flow quality                  necessary for modem aerodynamics experiments are usually                        reserved for graduate research. The wind tunnel features                        interchangeable test cells measuring 750 mm X 750 mm in cross-                  section that allow experiments to be set up without disrupting                  concurrent wind tunnel testing. In addition, modern                             instrumentation interfaced to a computer based data acquisition                 system allows students to acquire, process, and interpret                       experimental data for a variety of fundamental experiments.                     This will serve to reinforce basic concepts studied in pure                     engineering science courses in addition to teaching students                    modern experimental methods.",
