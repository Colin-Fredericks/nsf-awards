 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hyperplasia is a distinctive component of the hypertrophy that                  occurs in the overloaded and stretched avian wing; a large number               of embryonic myosin positive fibers appear in intra- and                        interfascicular locations. The number of fibers formed decreases                as a function of increasing age. This proposal examines two                     potential mechanisms of nascent fiber formation: 1) from                        activation, proliferation and fusion of satellite cells, and 2)                 from existing fibers through a process referred to as \"fiber                    splitting\", where a fiber splits along its longitudinal axis,                   producing first a branched fiber, and ultimately two independent                fibers. Mature and immature chickens will be infused continuously               with bromodeoxyuridine, a thymidine analogue and marker of cell                 division, during the overload period in order to distinguish                    whether one or both processes are involved in nascent fiber                     formation. Virtually all myonuclei of nascent fibers formed                     through proliferation and fusion of satellite cells will be                     labelled, while nascent fibers formed from pre-existing fibers                  will contain few labelled nuclei. Satellite cells involved in                   formation of new fibers in interfascicular spaces would be                      required to migrate from their fibers into these areas. The                     location of activated and proliferating satellite cells will be                 examined during overload in order to determine if satellite cells               located on fibers at the periphery of fascicles are                             preferentially activated. Finally, Dr. Schultz will test directly               if environments in overloaded muscles promote interstitial fiber                formation by implanting myoblasts into control and overloaded                   muscles and comparing their fusion behavior with the electron                   microscope. These studies should provide fundamental additional                 information to our understanding of the plasticity of skeletal                  muscle during a response to increased functional demand.",
