 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a cooperative research project between                      Dr. Paul Slovic of the Decision Science Research Institute in                   Eugene, Oregon and Professor Hirotada Hirose, Department of                     Psychology, Tokyo Women's Christian University.  Specifically                   it supports an initial working group meeting between the U.S.                   and Japanese researchers on a project entitled \"Comparisons                     of Risk Attitudes and Perceptions.\"  This project is also                       supported by a grant from the NSF Decision, Risk, and                           Management Science Program.   It is an ambitious project to                     address an important issue of national consequence.  Although                   the United States and Japan are highly industrialized                           countries, their approaches to managing technological risks                     are quite different.  The United States relies primarily on a                   \"confrontational model\" characterized by adversarial                            relationships between interested parties, widespread public                     participation, and extensive use of the legal system.  The                      Japanese system, in comparison, is based on a \"cooperative                      model\" centered upon private negotiations between government                    and industry with an  emphasis on consensus building.  The                      investigators in the  cooperative study hypothesize that                        these contrasting approaches are reflected in major differences                 in public attitudes and  perceptions of risk in general and                     risk management in  particular.                                                                                                                                 The investigators will examine these differences by carrying                    out parallel studies of risk attitudes and risk perceptions                     in both countries.  They will draw upon their extensive prior                   experience in analyzing the components of risk in various                       populations.  In addition to providing information that will                    be relevant to future interactions between the two countries,                   this comparison will increase basic understanding of national                   risk-management styles and approaches.",
