 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aerial plant surfaces support diverse populations of                       epiphytic bacteria including ice-nucleation-active Pseudomonas                  syringae strains.  Previous studies indicate that P. syringae                   strains compete for the same limiting resource in the                           phyllosphere, but exhibit differences in their relative                         competitive ability and their degree of coexistence.  One P.                    syringae strain investigated showed a high degree of coexistence                with other epiphytic bacterial species, including Xanthomonas                   maltophilia and Erwinia herbicola.  The proposed research will                  examine the role of resource partitioning in the coexistence of                 bacterial epiphytes, particular differential site occupation and                different nutrient utilization.  The spatial distribution of                    coexisting epiphytes will be examined using immuno-fluorescence                 and immuno-electron microscopy.  Further, the role of aggregation               and site independence will be addressed using a binary sensing                  system based on bioluminescence and the diffusion of an activator               from one strain to another.  The role of different nutrient                     utilization in coexistence will be investigated using naturally                 occurring P. syringae strain pairs and isogenic P. syringae                     strains altered in specific metabolic capabilities.  The use of                 manipulated isogenic strains will provide a powerful tool in                    these investigations of resource partitioning.  The investigators               will use innovative and carefully-executed molecular techniques                 to investigate the importance of resource partitioning in                       determining coexistence in bacterial communities.",
