 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Research Experiences for Undergraduates award, six                      students will concentrate on applications of probability to the                 analysis of basic questions in group theory.  The principal goal                is one of determining in a probabilistic sense the likelihood                   that two elements of a group commute.  Specifically, the team                   will construct confidence intervals for the location parameter of               a symmetric random variable.  The method uses the notion of                     resampling introduced by Tukey for determining what are called                  typical values for the subsample means.                                                                                                                         To attack the problems, students will be introduced to the high                 level programming language, CAYLEY, which enables the user to                   define algebraic structures in which various structural                         properties can then be classified.  This important tool is                      generally not available to undergraduates.                                                                                                                      Reports will be prepared at the end of the program.  Those                      students who have made significant progress will refine the work                into publishable form; efforts will be made to have students                    present their work at forthcoming professional meetings.  This is               the third year of support for this program.  Results to date have               been substantial.",
