 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will develop a methodology to predict engineering              properties in injection molded parts.  The methodology will                     incorporate the application of connectionist learning systems,                  neural networks, to the processing of non-newtonian viscoelastic                polymeric materials.  The desired engineering properties in                     injection molded parts are strongly dependent upon the                          thermomechanical history which, in turn, is greatly influenced by               the processing parameters.  The relationships between part                      properties and thermomechanical history are complex and highly non-             linear, therefore the methodology to be developed will be based on              a back propagation algorithm that provides the means for training               networks with adaptive non-linear units.  The networks will be                  trained with the thermomechanical history of a simple plaque, from              the results of injection molding simulation programs, and the                   corresponding engineering properties.  The network relates                      thermomechanical history to the part properties through the                     weighted connections developed during training.  Thus, when                     thermomechanical histories from simulation results are known for                every location within any part, the corresponding properties can                be predicted.                                                                       This methodology which is based on neural network computation               will provide part designers with the ability to predict engineering             properties in injection molded parts without molding and testing                actual components.",
