 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms are now used in a wide               spectrum of disciplines including neurophysiology, electrical                   engineering, computer science, mathematics, and the cognitive                   sciences.  But only a small number of economists have used these                powerful statistical methods because of their heavy computational               demands and because the theory to rigorously test hypotheses and                make efficient estimates using ANN does not yet exist for the                   types of problems faced by economists.  This project explores a                 promising method called simulated annealing that could                          significantly reduce computational costs and permit rigorous                    hypothesis testing for economic problems.                                                                                                                       More specifically, the grant permits the investigator to purchase               additional processors for his computer so that he can use                       simulated annealing algorithms for constrained optimization. The                additional processors will improve the performance of the                       computer and allow the estimation of more realistic economic                    models.  The project tests the ability of ANN models to                         approximate classical production function using experimental                    production data from agricultural economics.",
