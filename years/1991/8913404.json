 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a visit by Dr. Peter R. Jones of                            Marquette University to the University of Tasmania, in                          Hobart, to work with Dr. Peter G. Trotter on an area of                         number theory involving semigroups.  The investigators                          plan to merge two areas of semigroup theory research                            which have seen the greatest advances over the past                             decade, but whose development has been almost                                   completely independent.  The first is \"finite\"                                  semigroup theory, which arises from the explicit                                connections among formal languages, automata and finite                         semigroups.  The other is the theory of completely                              regular semigroups--those which are unions of their                             subgroups, and research on which has seen a resurgence                          of late.  Important recent developments in each field                           will be applied to the other, notably Polak's                                   decomposition theory for varieties will be applied to                           finite semigroup theory, and the \"derived category\" of                          a morphism will be applied to completely regular                                semigroup theory.  The key fusion will involve a                                systematic study of the \"local\" varieties of completely                         regular monoids.",
