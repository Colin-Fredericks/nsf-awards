 "awd_abstract_narration": "The heat shock response, defined as the rapid induction of heat              shock proteins (HSPs), was first described in 1962 by Ritossa in                Drosophila.  It has since been shown that the response is                       ubiquitous in all living organisms, that it can be elicited by a                wide range of physiological and noxious stimuli, and that the genes             and proteins of HSPs are highly conserved through evolution.  These             features underscore the importance of HSPs in biology.  This                    laboratory has shown that the heat shock response is attenuated in              senescent human diploid fibroblasts.  Experiments are proposed to               study the signal transduction mechanism of the heat shock response              and the regulation of this mechanism in cell aging.  Specifically,              experiments are proposed to evaluate if cAMP and cAMP-dependent                 protein kinase may participate in the regulation of heat shock gene             expression, and if so, whether this regulation is through the basal             or the inducible promoter element.  The approaches to be used                   include:  analysis of the effects of expression vectors of cAMP-                dependent protein kinase and the protein kinase inhibitor on the                basal and heat induced expression of the hsp 70 promoter driven                 reporter gene; and determining the effects of cAMP-elevating agents             on the expression of the endogenous and transfected hsp 70 gene.                                                                                                The wealth of knowledge of the molecular organization of the heat               shock genes, the age-dependent attenuation of this induction, and               the acknowledged importance of cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein                  kinase as a biological control mechanism are features that make                 this system particularly useful in analysis of signal transduction              and gene expression.  The long-range goal of this research program              is to gain a better understanding of the regulation and function                of heat shock genes.",
