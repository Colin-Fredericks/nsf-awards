 "awd_abstract_narration": "While there is much conjecture regarding how jurors sort through                and order information in hearing evidence and making decisions,                 there is only limited knowledge about what actually occurs and why.             Some of the best work that has sought to unravel how people reason              posits a story model to explain how jurors' judgments are reached.              To date, based on experimental study, the story model has generated             a compelling theory about how jurors understand evidence and make               decisions prior to deliberation in juries.  In contrast to additive             and algebraic models that posit that jurors add or average                      information to arrive at their decisions, the story model                       emphasizes explanation-based components of juror comprehension and              reasoning.                                                                                                                                                      Dr. Pennington, who along with Dr. Hastie has pioneered the story               model, is now embarked on this next stage of the research.  The                 current experimental program aims (1) to specify the process                    components of the theory by examining the inferences made during                the comprehension of evidence and the factors that influence which              inferences are made at what points in the comprehension process;                (2) to determine the relationship and interaction between                       processing stages proposed in the model--story construction,                    verdict learning, and story clarification--which have been assumed              to occur sequentially but might occur in a more repetitive cycling              fashion; and (3) to establish the robustness and boundaries of the              story model through the use of case materials less immediately                  susceptible to story construction.  The experiments are each labor-             intensive studies that use sophisticated methods to analyze the                 micro processes of  decisionmaking.  The combined program should                advance our basic understanding of jury decisionmaking and of other             types of legal judgments such as accounts of disputes, litigant                 perceptions of events, and attorney and judicial decisionmaking.                Also, this research should add to our general knowledge about the               cognitive mechanisms that mediate social processes and decisions.",
