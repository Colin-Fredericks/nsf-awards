 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in bioengineer-                  ing between Dr. Vernon Newhouse, Drexel University, and two                     European investigators:  Dr. Dominique Cathignol, National                      Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM), Lyons,                      France and Dr. Piero Tortoli, Electrical Engineering                            Department, University of Florence, Italy.  The objective of                    the project is to find more accurate methods of blood-flow                      measurement.                                                                                                                                                    Dr. Newhouse and his research group have discovered a new                       method of blood-flow measurement, in which the transducer is                    held at right angles to the blood-flow.  But tests are                          required to perfect this method and to shed more light on the                   interpretation of data. The laboratory in Florence has Doppler                  systems whose parameters can be adjusted optimally for this                     transverse Doppler method.  Such systems are not available                      commercially.  Dr. Tortoli and his associates are willing to                    test this method in simulated blood-flow and living subjects.                   In order to develop the Transverse Doppler method further,                      the US investigator has developed new transducer designs                        which will make it possible to separate flow parameters, such                   as turbulence and mean flow velocity.  The research group in                    Lyons headed by Dr. Cathignol will assist Dr. Vernon to                         construct these new transducer shapes and test them with the                    instrumentation in his laboratory, which is highly sophisti-                    cated and not generally available in the US.",
