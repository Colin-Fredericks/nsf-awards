 "awd_abstract_narration": "In spring of 1992, Scripps Institution of Oceanography will open a new          Aquarium-Museum.  The enlarges facility will include a 3700 sq. ft.             gallery, the Scripps Hall of Oceanography.  Funding is requested for a          new exhibit in this gallery, Exploring the Blue Planet, which will offer        visitors an overview of the ocean sciences -- to our knowledge, the only        major exhibit on oceanography in the United States.  The exhibit first          introduces visitors to our water planet, followed by a walk through the         history of oceanographic research.  Visitors are then invited to explore        the ocean world as if they were oceanographers themselves, making               discoveries as they follow the theme of \"water\" through the hall, adding        components one-by-one to build a global system: first water alone (water        chemistry and movements), then adding air (climate and weather), next           adding land (seafloor spreading and plate tectonics), and finally adding        life (adaptations of organisms to the marine environment).  Through             interactive exhibits on scientific concepts, coupled with exhibits on           related Scripps research projects, visitors gain an appreciation for the        process of science and its application to their everyday lives.  The            conclusion of Exploring the Blue Planet brings together the four realms         of water, air, land and life to emphasize the nature of Earth as an             interrelated global system.  Visitors learn that oceanography, an               interdisciplinary science that is global in scale and often                     international in practice, lends itself to a balanced and comprehensive         investigation of global change and our future on earth.",
