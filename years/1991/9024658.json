 "awd_abstract_narration": "This small grant will provide for pilot testing, preparation of                 instruments, and consultations among principal investigators for                renewal and extension of the investigators' prior NSF-supported                 study on rule systems in Japanese and American schools.  The aim                of the new research is to expand and refine the study of                        socialization into rule systems in Japan and the United States by               focusing on children's development of a sense of obligation.  This              planning grant will constitute the initial stages of a major                    project.  The anticipated design calls for exploration of                       developmental and cultural differences in the sense of obligation               to either follow the established rules and norms or adhere to one's             own internalized values.  This grant will also provide support for              an undergraduate student, under the Research Experience for                     Undergraduates (REU) Program, to work on the development stages of              a potential large-scale, cross-cultural study.                                                                                                                  This research promises to continue the investigators' previous                  successful line of research on legal socialization and classroom                motivation.  How rule systems develop and function and produce                  different patterns of conduct and accomplishment in Japanese and                American youths has profound implications for understanding not                 only law-abiding behavior in citizens but also achievement and                  academic motivation in youth.",
