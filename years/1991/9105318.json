 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this study is to compare the acid-base                    surface chemistry and dissolution kinetics of a series of minerals              of similar composition and increasing structural complexity.  This              series includes bromellite (corundum, quartz), phenakite,                       chrysoberyl (and beryl).  This study is intended to establish a                 link between models for dissolution of simple oxides, which are                 easily studied, and rock-forming minerals containing several                    potential sites for dissolution.                                                     The research entails determining the dissolution rate laws for             phenakite, chrysoberyl and beryl as a function of pH and                        temperature in the range of 15-80 degrees C.  Data already exist                for the other minerals.  An essential part of the research is                   comparison of the dissolution activation energies with the                      enthalpies of hydrogen- and hydroxyl-ion adsorption.  This                      comparison will determine the extent that variations in equilibrium             adsorption enthalpies with pH account for the reported variation                in dissolution activation energies with solution pH.                                 The proposed minerals have properties which are uniquely                   suited to establish the aforementioned link.  All dissolve                      sufficiently slowly that solute diffusion does not affect the                   reaction rate.  Thus the acid-base surface chemistry, which                     controls the pH-dependence of the reaction rate, can be easily                  characterized.  Most importantly, the coordination chemistry of                 cations to oxygens is consistent in the entire series of minerals.              This research involves fundamental understanding of the kinetics                of dissolution in common rock-forming minerals necessary to get at              the basics of rock weathering are metamorphism.",
