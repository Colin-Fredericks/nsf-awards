Its                                    ultimate objective is to mitigate structural                                    damage resulting from expansive soil                                            movement.  The work plan consist of                                             theoretical, laboratory and field studies,                                      and will continue the field measurements                                        obtained during a recently completed research                                   project.  Monthly measurements will be made                                     of soil moisture content, soil suction,                                         surface elevation and depth of shrink/heave,                                    and the long-term development of the                                            distorted shape of swelling soil beneath                                        slabs will be measured and compared with that                                   predicted by a model developed from the field                                   data acquired from the previous study.  These                                   results of the work will elucidate and relate                                   soil differential movement as a function of                                     climate, soil suction and clay mineralogy                                       with actual measured field values.",
