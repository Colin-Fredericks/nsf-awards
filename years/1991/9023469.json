 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of research by the investigator on               the theoretical foundation of long run economic growth.  Previous               work emphasized bridging the gap between our microeconomic                      understanding of firms and industries on the one hand and our                   understanding of aggregate growth on the other.  More specifically,             aggregate growth theory is increasingly being forced to consider                the large numbers of distinct goods that are hidden by the familiar             univariate measures of capital or consumption.  Once one begins to              take seriously the enormous diversity of goods, one is inevitably               lead to reexamine existing assumptions about how these goods                    interact with each other.  Traditional aggregate theory makes the               implicit assumption that these goods are functionally identical in              the sense that there is an infinite elasticity of substitution                  between these goods.  An alternative assumption is that the large               variety of goods enter into production or consumption in a way that             is additively separable.  Virtually all of the work on aggregate                economics falls into one of these two categories.  This project                 develops new tractable mathematical models that can allow for many              goods, for the introduction of new goods, and for complicated                   interactions between goods.  The motivation for constructing models             with richer sets of goods and interactions is to answer specific                questions about technology, economic growth, savings and trade that             can not be understood without this additional structure.                                                                                                        This project uses models of technological change in the presence                of many goods to address important and fundamental economic                     questions.  These questions include the following:                                                                                                                   1.  Is technological change responsible for the divergence in                   the rate of growth of wages for skilled and unskilled labor                     that has been observed in the U.S.?  Can technological change                   lead to stagnant or declining wages for unskilled labor?                                                                                                        2.  Why is it that most trade takes place between countries                     at similar stages of development?                                                                                                                               3.  How can it be that savings rates are high, rates of                         consumption growth are high, and rates of return are low in                     some developing countries?",
