 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a basic research program concerning semantic models for            parallel programming languages.  Initial emphasis is on the design of           a mathematical model of parallel algorithms  extending and                      generalizing earlier work of Berry and Curien on sequential algorithms          and concrete data structures.  The model is intensional, in that the            denotation of a program includes information about parallel                     computation strategy in addition to information about the extensional           or functional behavior of the program.  This allows a novel                     intensional strictness ordering on parallel algorithms that plays a             fundamental role in our theory; for instance, application of a                  parallel algorithm to its arguments is a continuous operation with              respect to this ordering.                                                                                                                                            It will be shown that the model forms a cartesian closed category          in which an elegant account of parallel functional computation can be           given.  It will support semantically-based techniques for proving both          traditional (extensional) correctness properties and efficiency                 properties that depend on intensional aspects of program behavior.              The intensional information will be used to determine a hierarchical            class of algorithms based on an intuitively reasonable notion of                \"degree of parallelism\".  This idea will provide a framework for                assessing the relative expressive powers of various sequential and              parallel primitives.  In the long term theoretical insights gained in           this investigation will be in the design of new programming languages           that employ parallelism uniformly and generally, yet whose semantic             properties are well understood, and for which tractable proof methods           can be devised.",
