 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of this project is to train and educate the next                   generation of scientists.  An integral part of the educational                  program is to provide a fulfilling research opportunity for                     undergraduate students.  It is strongly believed that this will                 stimulate further science interests, instill excitement with                    scientific research, and promote future careers in the sciences.                This institution has a long standing history of providing                       research experience to undergraduates.  Over the past thirteen                  years many undergraduates have been hired to work in a variety of               research projects during the summer and acedemic year.  These                   students have continued their careers in physics, astrophysics,                 computer science, and electronics.  During the past four years                  alone 15-20 undergraduates have been hired on a part-time basis                 to assist with observatory and research projects.  Being selected               as a NSF REU site for the summers of 1987-90 has enabled the                    normal summer hiring of students to be expanded to a full-scale                 summer program for students, which is similar in size to that of                the National Observatories.  This is not an apprenticeship                      program but a tutorial in research experience.",
