 "awd_abstract_narration": "A prototype was developed in Phase I for measuring the thermal                  conductivity of thin films, proving the capabilities of a                       measuring technique in the range not covered by any other                       existing commercial equipment.  The measurement method is based                 on the definition of the thermal resistance, as opposed to the                  mostly indirect methods used in the past.  Its operating range                  extends from thin optical films to bulk materials.  The                         technique was verified by measurements of thin and thick bulk                   samples and the results closely correlate with the published                    values for those materials.  Final testing was accomplished by                  successfully measuring two micrometer thick SiO2 films deposited                on single crystal silicon substrates.  During Phase II the                      performance of the system will be significantly improved,                       leading to a useful commercial instrument.  Modifications are                   planned for the sensor head, electronic circuit and control                     software.                                                                                                                                                       Development and commercial availability of a nondestructive test                for thermal conductivity and interface thermal resistance in                    dielectric and other thin films will permit rapid advances to                   be made in the design and construction of multilayer structures                 with improved heat flow characteristics.  Several technologies                  will be aided by this instrument, with applications in high                     speed electronics, optics, optical and magneto-optical                          recording, thin films, superconducting films, as well as                        diamond-like coatings.",
