 "awd_abstract_narration": "One objective of population biology is to understand how                   the environment leads to differences among species; another is to               explore the behavioral and physiological mechanisms that control                life history traits of individual species.  This research is                    designed to contribute to this basic knowledge by studying how                  hormones shape and direct the life of a small bird, the dark-eyed               junco.  The focus is on males and the hormone testosterone, which               is known to have numerous effects on animal behavior, physiology,               and morphology (shape and form).  These effects include a                       suppressive effect of testosterone on male parental behavior and                a stimulatory effect on behavior related to mate attraction, e.g.               singing.  Testosterone can also decrease resistance to disease.                 By manipulating the amount of testosterone in the blood and                     comparing the behavior and physiology of the treated birds to                   that of untreated, control birds, changes induced will be                       examined and related to correlates of fitness, such as ability                  to sire offspring, life span, and survival of offspring.  The                   birds will be studied in the field where their survival and                     success in producing offspring can be monitored.  By tracking the               fates of animals whose physiology and behavior deviates from the                normative state, the research will lead to a more fundamental                   understanding of how hormonal systems evolve and what balance of                selective factors and organismal responses keeps a particular                   animal species \"on track\" over evolutionary time.",
