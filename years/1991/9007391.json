 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the planned research is to examine whether                there is evidence, reflected in DNA sequences, that natural                     selection has played a role in the long term evolutionary                       persistence of two mutant enzyme variants.  As a model system                   that study focuses on the essential metabolic enzyme, glucose-6-                phosphate dehydrogenase, in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster.                   Earlier studies indicated that there are significant differences                in the biochemical propoerties associated with the  common                      genetic variants, but it is not clear if these differences                      contribute to the long-term evolutionary fate of the polymorphism               in natural populations.  Current advances in the mathematical                   theory of DNA sequence evolution predict very specific patterns                 will be associated with genetic polymorphism that have been                     maintained in populations for long periods of time because of                   natural selection.  This model system presents the opportunity to               apply this new theory.  Such studies are essential if we are to                 understand the forces that effect the genetic variation which is                ubiquitous in natural populations of all species, including                     humans, and it will also help us to understand the forces shaping               DNA sequence variation.",
