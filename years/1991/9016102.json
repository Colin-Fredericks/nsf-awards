 "awd_abstract_narration": "Foraging organisms typically must consider many factors when                    making decisions about how and when to move within and between                  patches of food.  The objectives of this research are to (1)                    contrast the responses of two streams insects which are                         morphologically and behaviorally distinct to combinations of                    costs and risks experienced while foraging, (2) examine in detail               how one                                                                         potential cost, the presence of competitors, influences foraging                behavior, and (3) determine the influence of forager density and                resource levels on growth and reproduction.  Behavioral                         observations of responses to forced contacts with competitors and               predators under different environmental conditions will be used                 to compare the relative importance of the different factors.                    Behavioral observations of interactions between feeding                         individuals at different densities and resource levels will be                  used to determine the nature of interactions between potential                  competitors.  Experiments which measure growth rate and fecundity               will determine if resource levels and the presence of competitors               influence fitness.  The principle contribution of this research                 will be an assessment of interactions between multiple concurrent               costs and risks faced while foraging, and a determination of the                role of competition.                                                                                                                                            Potential applications of the findings include: management of                   trout in stocked streams, and prediction of effects of                          alterations of stream habitats.  Basic information from the study               will also contribute to the understanding of mechanisms that                    maintain species diversity and increase the robustness of                       conservation practices.",
