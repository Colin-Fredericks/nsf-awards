 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is designed to test hypotheses about                 the function of horns and to apply results to the conservation of               asocial megavertebrates, particularly in response to catastrophic               reductions due to poaching.  To delay the decline, a bold                       experiment is being attempted in Namibia where male and female                  black rhinos have been dehorned.  Unlike actions employed in                    other geographic regions, dehorning has been controversial for                  three principal reasons:  (1) while horns are re-grown, rates of                re-growth remain unknown making it impossible to know where horn                removal might be needed again; (2) because not all animals are                  dehorned, horned animals may have reproductive advantages; hence,               effects of removal on the breeding and genetic structure of the                 population are unclear; and (3) the calves of hornless females                  may be more vulnerable to predation.  In the absence of                         information, horn function cannot be assessed.                                       The proposed research addresses these issues by gathering                  data on horn growth and regrowth, comparing reproduction among                  rhinos varying in horn size, and examining the frequency of                     attacks by predators toward, and responses of, horned and                       hornless rhinos.  Two study sites will be used, one with horned                 and hornless rhinos, and another with individuals all with intact               horns.  The research promises new insight into the effects of                   anatomical structures on life histories of animals in the wild,                 and has significant potential for affecting management of this                  rare species.",
