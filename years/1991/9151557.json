 "awd_abstract_narration": "A  senior-level laboratory in semiconductor materials and                       device fabrication is being developed to provide hands-on                       experience with abstract concepts obtained two semiconductor                    device and one optical electronics courses.  The experiments                    center on (1) semiconductor/metal film deposition,(2)                           semiconductor processing and characterization, an (3) simple                    device formation.  The laboratory also supports an                              undergraduate honors course which has an independent student                    research component culminating in a required article, abstract                  submission, or senior thesis.  The laboratory provides                          practical experience, including computerized data acquisition,                  with the fundamental material aspects of semiconductors.                        Innovative aspects include (1) in-class electro- and                            \"electroless\" deposition of most metal chalcogenide films to be                 utilize and (2) a \"team-within-a-team\" concept where 2-3 person                 teams symbiotically coordinate with other teams to complete                     projects.  Major items of equipment include an x-ray                            diffractometer (phase and grain size determination), a                          UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer for optical absorption/reflectance                 spectroscopy (band-gap and free carrier determination),                         electromagnet and computerized data acquisition system for Hall                 and van der Pauw measurements, annealing oven (annealing and                    contact firing), microbalance (thickness determination),                        diamond wire saw (sample shaping), bell jar evaporation system                  (contact deposition), monochromator system (photoconductivity,                  photo-current, and luminescence spectra), and capacitance-                      voltage meter/curve trace (both for junction/contact                            characterization).",
