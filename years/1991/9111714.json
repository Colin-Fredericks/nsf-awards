 "awd_abstract_narration": "With three years of National Science Foundation support, Dr.                    Herbert Haas will continue the operation of the Southern                        Methodist University radiocarbon laboratory and increase its                    ability to date archaeologically significant samples.  Through                  his widespread contacts with the anthropological community, Dr.                 Haas collaborates with archaeologists working in many parts of                  the world and provides absolute ages for organic samples which                  they submit.  Currently, the laboratory supports projects                       involving over 89 archaeologists working in more than 31 states                 and countries.  With NSF support, this collaboration will                       continue.  Secondly, Dr. Haas will work to refine the radiocarbon               dating technique itself and will concentrate in two areas.  He                  will develop better procedures for dating the humic acids in                    soils.  To achieve this, he will date samples from secure                       stratigraphic contexts where independent means for age evaluation               are available.  He will also analyze multiple samples from a                    single soil horizons which extend over large geographical areas.                Secondly, Dr. Haas will focus on dates which lie near the limits                of the radiocarbon technique.  While in theory determinations up                to 55,000 years old are possible, most laboratories are equipped                to work accurately over only a ca. 35-40,000 time span.  Dr. Haas               will concentrate on the 35-55,000 interval.  He will develop                    techniques for sample evaluation and for elimination of sources                 of potential contamination which may be introduced during the                   dating process.                                                                                                                                                 The goal of anthropological archaeology is to trace the process                 of cultural development over time.  To accomplish this, it is                   essential that materials and excavated sites be chronologically                 accurately placed.  The radiocarbon technique provides an                       important way to accomplish this and it is crucial to the                       discipline that laboratories sympathetic to these goal be                       supported.  The SMU laboratory is well known both for the                       carefulness of its work and its willingness to analyze difficult                samples. With NSF support, this important resource will be                      maintained.  The research conducted will not only provide dates                 for archaeological use but also refine the dating technique                     itself.",
