 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project makes an important contribution to the statistical                 theory of the analysis of economic time series. It represents a                 continuation of earlier work on cointegration, which is a way to                capture equilibrium relations among dynamic variables. A vector                 time series xt is said to be cointegrated if a linear combination               of the levels of the elements of xt is stationary with finite                   variance.  Much empirical research in macroeconomics has shown that             economic time series data typically include non-stationary                      processes such as trends and are therefore linked together in the               long run. To gain any meaningful insight into the actual movements              of the variable in the economy, they must be purged of the                      influence of the non-stationary processes. Cointegration is a way               of doing this since the linear combinations of the levels of time               series variables are stationary, even if the underlying series are              not.                                                                                                                                                            In prior work, the linear combination is an attractor for the                   levels of the series. The extension of these concepts in this                   project involve the concept of a repellor, which is a region in the             phase space, away from which xt is relatively likely to move. The               concept of a negative strength of attraction is developed for a                 repellor. Both attractors and repellors are related to stable and               unstable equilibria in deterministic models and the work in this                project will develop statistical tests for their presence.  The                 goal is to provide a more general set of tools for studying short               memory economic processes, through attractors and varying strength              of attraction; and for modelling long memory processes, including               trends, with repellors.                                                                                                                                         A second part of the project involves work on the dimensionality                problems in linear systems of cointegrated time series. The economy             is divided into sectors and a common vector of each sector is                   estimated and analyzed. This will allow for an analysis with many               fewer variables than if all of the series are considered jointly.",
