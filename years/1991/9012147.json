 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much can be learned of the nutritional status, relative growth                  rates, physiology and food web position of particular organisms                 from biochemical and stable isotope measurements.  However, these               measurements are almost always complicated in natural field                     samples by the presence of contaminating detritus and other                     organisms.  Since direct biochemical measurements of the bulk                   phytoplankton (collected on filters) are often equivocal,                       researchers have employed statistical methods and incubation                    experiments for determining phytoplankton biomass and                           assimilation patterns.  A powerful alternative to these indirect                solutions to the problem is flow cytometric cell sorting.                                                                                                       Flow cytometry, which allows us to recognize several classes of                 phytoplankton based on their autofluorescence and light scatter                 properties and to physically separate these particles form all                  others, will be used to obtain samples from a variety of oceanic                regimes for measurements of C and N (and secondarily, of the                    natural abundances of C and N stable isotopes).                                                                                                                 Specifically,Dr. Olson will answer the following questions about                the nature and extent of N limitation in the oceans:                                                                                                            *    Is there a difference between the C:N ratios of                                 phytoplankton cells (and of specific groups within the                          phytoplankton) in coastal waters and those in the                               oligotrophic ocean?                                                        *    Are there seasonal differences in C:N ratio of                                  phytoplankton?                                                             *    Are there changes in C:N of the phytoplankton with depth?                  *    Are there diel changes in C:N ratios in the phytoplankton?                 *    What are the characteristics of the \"non-phytoplankton\"                         under these sets of conditions?                                                                                                                            The results will shed light on the extent of N-limitation int he                oceans and on the ecological roles of different groups of                       phytoplankton, and will help interpret observed patterns of                     isotope abundance in water column particle samples.  It should                  also act as a springboard for a variety of other biochemical                    measurements of specific components of the plankton.",
