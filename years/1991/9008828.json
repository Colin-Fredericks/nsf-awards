 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this collaborative research is to analyze, from a                theoretical perspective, a number of aspects of recent regulatory               reform in the U.S.  The project will focus on three broad areas:                (1) The management of competition in regulated industries; (2)                  The optimal design of regulatory policy; and (3)  The                           implementation of price-cap regulation.  In the first part, the                 investigators will explore, from a theoretical perspective, how                 to combine in an optimum way competition and regulation in                      regulated industries such a electric power, telecommunications,                 and transportation.  In the second part, research will be                       directed at analyzing the implications of regulatory commissions                holding regulated industries, such as public utilities, fully                   responsible for decisions having unfavorable outcomes, while at                 the same time allowing only meager rewards for favorable                        outcomes.  The third part of the project will analyze the                       implications of price-cap regulation which many state regulatory                commissions have adopted to control intrastate phone rates.  This               project is important because it will provide a more fundamental                 understanding of the impact of alternative regulation regimes on                the performance of regulated industries.",
