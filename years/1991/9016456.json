 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the study of the optical transmission                    properties of high temperature superconductors, using free standing             ultrathin single crystals and the exceptionally bright infrared                 radiation available at the National Synchrotron Light Source at                 Brookhaven.  A major part of the research will be devoted to sample             preparation and characterization, including structural and                      transport measurements carried out at Stony Brook.  The objectives              of the present investigation are to elucidate the nature of the                 superconducting energy gap in these compounds, and to study the                 optically active elementary excitations in the normal and                       superconducting states.  The optical reflectivity of these                      materials is unusual and complex and transmission studies have an               inherent advantage of better accuracy at low frequencies.                       Materials with magnetic and non-magnetic dopants, with irradiation              induced defects, and with various level of oxygen deficiency will               be prepared and investigated.  Studies will also be made of                     reference samples of conventional superconductors and quasi two-                dimensional metals.",
