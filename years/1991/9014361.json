Over a period of three                              years, the researchers will undertake mutual short-term                         visits to each other's laboratories.  The focus of the                          research is deterministic modelling of the progress of                          anthracnose disease in stylosanthes, a pasture crop                             grown both in Australia and in many parts of the United                         States, especially in the South.                                                                                                                                The researchers, using data collected in Australia,                             will investigate multivariate and regression models                             concerning the disease's spread in relation to other                            environmental variables, especially weather, for which                          data have been collected.  Adapting techniques devised                          to study diseases in humans, they will also                                     investigate the stochastic process related to disease                           spread.  The research may lead to better management and                         control of this disease in legumes.",
