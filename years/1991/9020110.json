The workshop, which                          will take place in the U.S.S.R., will focus on four                             topics:  Solar Activity, including solar cycle                                  manifestations; Solar Wind, including the sources of                            solar winds and the theory for and evolution of                                 large- and small-scale structures; Terrestrial Effects,                         such as magnetospheric responses as well as ground-based                        studies of ionosphere and magnetosphere disturbances;                           and Solar Acceleration, including the origin and                                propagation of solar cosmic rays as related to solar                            activity and terrestrial effects.                                                                                                                               The study of all these events, and particularly the                             quantitative reconstruction of the chain of events,                             requires the integration of knowledge from several                              disciplines.  Crucial understanding is acquired from                            both space- and ground-based data, research on which in                         the U.S. is sponsored respectively by the NASA and NSF.                         This workshop will be one of very few, either within the                        US or internationally, that review the entire                                   solar-terrestrial chain and thus will have the added                            benefit of helping to set objectives for the coordination                       of the U.S program of space- and ground-based research.                                                                                                         The workshop is being organized jointly by the U.S. NAS                         and the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. (ASUSSR).                           The U.S. delegation will be led by Dr. Norman F. Ness,                          President of the Bartol Research Foundation, University                         of Delaware.  The Soviet delegation will be chaired by                          Dr. Viktor N. Orayevskiy, Director of the ASUSSR                                Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere, and                             Radio Wave Propagation.  On the U.S. side the project                           is being jointly supported by NASA and NSF.                                                                                                                     This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the U.S. and U.S.S.R. to combine complementary efforts                          and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and                         competence in the field of basic scientific research on                         the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of                            benefit.",
