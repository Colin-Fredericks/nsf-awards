 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purchase of an Electron Spin Resonance Spectrometer is                      requested.  The system will consist of a basic console, an                      analog recorder and display, appropriate microprocessor                         systems for the superheterodyne and field controller and data                   handling systems.  It will be used to develop a full                            understanding of the process of adsorption of various                           surfactants an polymers and the effect of different parameters                                                                                                  on the structure of the adsorbed layers.                                        Adsorption of surfactants and polymers at the solid/liquid                      interface modify the surface properties of the solid.  Such                     modifications are used in many industrial processes such as                     flocculation, enhanced oil recovery and flotation.  In                          addition, the adsorbed layers, particularly self-assemblies                     such as hemimicelles have potential use in novel applications                   such as catalysis and isotope separation.  Hence,                               understanding of the adsorption phenomena is of great                           importance.  Earlier work focussed on understanding the                         physico-chemical mechanisms of adsorption of surfactants and                    polymers by measuring adsorption density, zeta potential,                       wettability and adsorption enthalpies.  Such studies have                       helped in generating a mechanistic picture of the structure of                                                                                                  the adsorbed layer.  However, it has become clear that a                        molecular level understanding of adsorption is essential for                    the full utilization of it in various processes.  Recently,                     EST has been used probe absorbed layers on solids on a                          molecular level.  These studies have demonstrated the                           potential of ESR Spectroscopy to elucidate the mechanisms of                    formation of adsorbed layers and hence of adsorption.  ESR                      spectroscopy is also the technique which recently proved very                   useful for us in examining the orientation of surfactants on                    solids in non-aqueous medium.                                                                                                                                   Future research plans using the equipment will includes                         conformational changes of polymers with flocculation and                        dispersion of fines.  Polymers labelled with nitroxide type                     probes will be used for such studies.  Another important area                   of investigation is to elucidate the role of surfactant",
