 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using ac calorimetry, heat capacity measurements will be carried                out on a series of different hydrocarbon films adsorbed on                      graphite.  A main focus of the work proposed is the study of the                melting transition of two-dimensional (2D) solids.  Using a set of              different hydrocarbon films we shall systematically study how the               nature of the melting transition depends on the size and shape of               the molecules which constitute the 2D solid.  This systematic                   approach is of interest because recent theoretical results indicate             that 2D melting is strongly influenced by molecular size and shape.             We have completed the first stage of this research with their study             of ethane films.                                                                                                                                                Following up some preliminary results on ethane, we shall study the             melting of thin hydrocarbon multilayers as well as the behavior                 near the bulk triple point of small bulk hydrocarbon crystallites               adsorbed on graphite.  In the high coverage regime they purpose is              to determine whether exfoliated graphite can be used as substrate               for studying surface melting.",
