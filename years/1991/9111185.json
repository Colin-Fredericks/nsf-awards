 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals frequently respond to changes in environmental conditions               by altering their behavior.  This common observation has led to                 the hypothesis that behavior evolves first, prior to changes in                 underlying aspects of morphology, physiology, or biochemistry.                  Artificial selection experiments will be used to test this                      hypothesis with respect to voluntary wheel-running behavior of                  randombred laboratory mice.  Replicated within-family selection                 on amount of wheel-running during the 5th and 6th days of                       exposure to activity wheels will be used to produce two high- and               two low-selected lines, while maintaining two unselected control                lines, each of 10-12 breeding pairs.  As lines diverge                          genetically in wheel-running behavior, they will be compared with               regard to a series of possibly correlated locomotor behaviors as                well as physiological characteristics that are hypothesized to                  partly determine capacities for sustained locomotor activity.                   Possibly correlated behaviors to be tested include several                      components of open-field activity, maximal sprint running speed,                and swimming endurance.  Physiological traits to be measured                    include maximal (VO2max) and basal (BMR) rates of oxygen                        consumption, hematocrit and blood hemoglobin content, thyroid                   hormone levels, heart, gastrocnemius muscle, and liver masses,                  and key indicator enzymes for both aerobic (oxidative) and                      anaerobic glycolytic capacities at the cellular level.                          Correlated responses to selection will allow quantification of                  genetic correlations between behaviors and between behavior and                 physiology.  Results will have significance for the understanding               of animal and human behavior, genetics, evolution, and                          physiology, including the interrelationships of health and well-                being, voluntary activity patterns, and innate exercise                         capacities.",
