 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infrared and ultraviolet image detection and processing requirements            have created an urgent need for high resolution and high gain                   frequency conversion mechanisms to shift wavelengths to the visible             regime.  Solid state imaging systems and optical processors for the             visible regime have approached the performance of the retina; in                contrast, their IR and UV counterparts suffer from high cost, poor              detectivity, and low resolution.  Optron Systems proposes to explore            the development of a Thin Film Optical Frequency Converter (TFOFC)              which can resolve, amplify, and convert infrared and ultraviolet                images to visible wavelengths for direct viewing, imaging, and optical          processing.  We intend to use a monolithic thin film sandwich                   structure that couples a visible-emitting electroluminescent film to a          photoconductive film with an optical gap tailored to the regime of              interest.  The principle of operation of the TFOFC involves using the           incident IR or UV radiation as a trigger and amplitude modulator for            the emission of visible light.  If successful, such a device could be           mass produced in large areas and at low cost and it would find                  immediate applications in, remote earth sensing, optical computing,             laser alignment, real-time image processing, machine vision,                    multispectral image fusion, edge detection, and astronomical imaging.",
