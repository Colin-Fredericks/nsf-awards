 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the first (two-year) research period, the roles of                           different interbilayer forces and bilayer fluidity on the                       molecular-scale deformations of adhering and fusing bilayer                     using novel electron microscopy and surface force measurements                                                                                                  have been studied.  These experiments identified a                              particularly important role for hydrophobic forces in adhesion                                                                                                  and fusion.  In this follow-up project, it is further proposed                                                                                                  to study how hydrophobic, stearic, and ionic interactions                       operate at the molecular level.  Various time-dependent                         effects associated with hydrophobic forces and adhesion are                     investigated.  Lipid mixtures and lipid-protein membranes are                                                                                                   used.  The effects of fusion-inducing proteins, such as                         Synexin, are probed.  The Surface Forces Apparatus will be                      used in parallel with a variety of Electron, scanning                           Tunneling, and Atomic Force Microscopy techniques.  The                         results will be important in (i) developing the capability to                                                                                                   directly study the interactions of real biological membranes                                                                                                    and of other biological macromolecule; (ii) the development                     of chemicals and processes which can control adhesion or                        fusion of vesicles, liposomes, and biological cells in                          biotechnological processes; and (iii) the effectiveness of                      surfactant as dispersant, in flotation, in foams, and in                        emulsions.",
