 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a two year cooperative                          research project on dense astrophysical plasmas, between                        Professor Hugh M Van Horn, Department of Physics and Astronomy,                 University of Rochester, and Professor Setsuo Ichimaru,                         Department of Physics, University of Tokyo, Japan.  In dense                    astrophysical objects, such as neutron stars, white dwarfs,                     low mass stars (brown dwarfs), the solar interior, and giant                    planets, collections of ionized nuclei and electrons constitute                 dense plasmas, which exhibit various kinds of phase changes.                    In recent years, due to advancements in condensed-matter                        theories coupled with progress in computer-simulation                           capabilities, it has become possible to carry out detailed                      analyses of those phase-transition processes in dense                           astrophysical plasmas.  The aim of this proposal is to                          undertake theoretical and computer-simulation studies on a                      number of those phase transition processes.  The processes to                   be studied include: (1) the possibility that neutron stars                      may have glassy rather than crystalline crusts, and what the                    consequences are of that; (2) the possibilities of phase                        separation in binary carbon/oxygen and iron/carbon mixtures,                    which have been suggested as energy sources in very cool                        white dwarfs; (3) iron/hydrogen phase separation, which may                     have interesting consequences for the evolution of low mass                     stars and \"brown dwarfs\"; and (4) hydrogen/helium phase                         separation in giant planets and brown dwarfs, which may prove                   a significant energy source in these bodies.                                                                                                                    The two groups involved in this collaboration complement each                   other well.  The Japanese scientists have a long history of                     important contributions in areas of dense plasma physics and                    condensed matter physics relevant to this collaboration, and                    also have a strong interest in astrophysical applications.                      The US group has a similar interest in astrophysics, together                   with a strong interest in the relevant properties of matter at                  high densities.  If successful this project will make a                         significant contribution to research problems at the interface                  between the disciplines of dense plasma physics, condensed                      matter physics and astrophysics.",
