 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Eckhard Krotscheck of Texas A & M                 University (TAMU) to collaborate in theoretical physics with                    Professor Mikko Saarela of the Department of Theoretical                        Physics of the University of Oulu, Finland.  They have two                      principle lines of joint research.  One is to produce a                         microscopic description of the structure and the excitations of                 uniform mixtures of the quantum fluids Helium-4 and Helium-3 in                 two and three dimensions.  They are particularly interested in                  critical concentrations and in the collective excitations, the                  effective mass, and the dynamic form factor of the mixture.  As                 a second line of research, they are working on questions                        related to  the symmetry-broken geometry of films of these                      isotopic elements adsorbed to a substrate.  Here they are                       seeking to produce a semi-quantitative description of the                       interface between the Helium-4 and the Helium-3 liquid and its                  collective excitation.  This research relies heavily upon the                   complementary expertise of the collaborating scientists which                   is the basis for an effective division of labor.  All of the                    numerical work on time-dependent correlation functions will be                  done in Finland, and all the work on non-uniform systems at                     TAMU.  The work on bulk mixtures will continue to be done at                    both locations.  Professor Saarela has derived most of the                      results necessary for the inclusion and optimization of three-                  body correlations, and Professor Krotscheck has worked out the                  CBF (correlated basis functions) corrections of ring diagrams                   and is presently working on the elementary diagrams.                                                                                                            The proposed work builds on a productive collaboration in the                   general area of the theory of strongly interacting many-body                    systems.  A thorough investigation of the problem of mixtures                   of Helium-3 and Helium-4 requires state-of-the-art many body                    theory at a level that is beyond what has been done previously                  in microscopic attempts to understand quantum liquid mixtures.                  The proposed research will contribute to such strengthening of                  many-body theory in quantum physics.  It applies state-of-the-                  art approaches to several interesting questions and is linked                   in a timely fashion to experimental research being done by                      others which will refine the theory.",
