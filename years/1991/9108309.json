NEXUS is a new effort to broker and organize                         collaborative research with commercial applications among firms,                universities, federal laboratories, and state agencies.  Its                    preliminary concept is a market-driven, private, nonprofit                      networking organization that will deliver NEXUS services and                    identify prototype NEXUS partnerships.  It will be implemented in               the 14 member states of the Southern Technology Council, of which               7 are participants in the NSF/EPSCoR initiative.  The potential for             expansion to the remaining 12 EPSCoR participants will be explored.             The total award is $33,060 for a one-year duration to the Southern              Growth Policies Board, Southern Technology Council.  The proposal               is recommended for funding.",
