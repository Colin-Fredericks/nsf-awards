 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many species of mammals, males compete physically for access                 to mating partners, and traits that confer an advantage in                      fighting are favored.  In other species, however, males seldom                  interact aggressively, yet some individuals still acquire more                  mates than others.  Dr. Schwagmeyer will conduct research on a                  species belonging to this second type.  She will investigate                    features of potential importance to male reproductive success in                a mating system in which aggression and combat play trivial                     roles.                                                                                                                                                          In previous research on thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Dr.                    Schwagmeyer found that breeding males spend most of their time                  simply searching for sexually receptive females.  Usually the                   number of mates that a male acquires is exactly equal to the                    number of sexually receptive females that he finds; thus, a                     male's skill in finding females is critical in determining his                  reproductive success.  Dr. Schwagmeyer will carry out a three-                  phase field study to examine how males actually locate a female                 during the 4 to 5 hours that she is sexually receptive.  The                    study will involve (1) monitoring male visits with females to                   determine if males can \"predict\" when a particular female will                  become sexually available, (2) temporarily removing females to                  assess whether or not males remember the geographic locations of                females they have encountered on previous days, and (3) observing               how males' abilities to remember the locations of females, and to               learn other spatial tasks, influence their mating success.                                                                                                      This research project represents a unique combination of the                    behavioral ecology of mating systems with the experimental                      psychology of spatial learning and memory.  Thus, in addition to                important and novel specific findings, the work offers new                      perspectives for both fields of science.",
