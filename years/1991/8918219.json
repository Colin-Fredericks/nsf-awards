 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research             project on solid mechanics between V. Lubarda of the University of              Titograd and D. Krajcinovic of Arizona State University is to                   develop a theory coupling elasto-plastic deformation of crystalline             solids and damage mechanics as it applies to plasticity of metals.              The investigators combine their joint expertise, Lubarda in elastic             plastic theory and Krajcinovic in damage theory.  The research                  results will advance current knowledge of plasticity and its                    application to problems in engineering and materials science. Of                particular interest is the possible application of this theory in               metal forming processes.                                                                                                                                        This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The award,                except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav             institution.",
