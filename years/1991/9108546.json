The purpose of                         this agreement is to have Dr. Thomas Higgins, Director                          of Technomics International, site visit fourteen EPSCoR                         States before June 15, 1991 to evaluate opportunities for                       EPSCoR/EEC scientific and engineering cooperation,                              commonalities of interests, methods of \"mapping\"                                state/country scientific strengths/weaknesses, and                              methods of evaluation.  The agreement provides for a                            minimum of four international trips to complete the site                        visits and present the \"findings\" at the EPSCoR annual                          conference.  Seven copies of the final report are                               required.                                                                                                                                                       Dr. Higgins' report will provide specific actions to be                         undertaken to enhance EPSCoR/EEC collaboration and                              cooperation.  Based upon the proposal and excellent                             reviews, this cooperative agreement for $50,000 is                              recommended.",
