 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This project supports the participation of 17                      U.S. scientists at an International Conference and Workshop                     on Chemical Metallurgy, to be held in Bombay, India,                            between January 9 and 13, 1991.  The Indian organizer is                        Dr. C.K. Gupta of the Bhabha Atomic Research Center                             (BARC).  The topics of the conference will include:                             physical chemistry of metal extraction; experimental                            techniques and measurement in metallurgical thermodynamics                      and kinetics; advances in pyro-and hydro-metallurgy of                          metals and of sulphides; oxide and halide reduction                             processes with special reference to the extraction and                          refining of refractory and reactive metals; nuclear metals                      and materials processing; rare earth metals technology;                         electrothermics, melting and refining; fluidized bed                            processes; minerals processing; chemical vapour deposition;                     plasma and laser applications in material processing;                           vacuum metallurgy; ultrapurification; computer applications                     in process metallurgy; process modelling and optimization;                      and energy conservation and pollution control in                                metallurgical processes.  The binational workshop will                          identify areas for future collaboration between U.S. and                        Indian scientists in the following broad topics: process                        metallurgy and optimization; energy conservation and                            pollution control in metallurgical processes; reagents in                       mineral industries; and solvent extraction and                                  electrowinning of base metals.  A workshop proceedings is                       planned to be published and distributed to U.S. and Indian                      interested scientists.                                                                                                                                          Scope:  The field of the conference and workshop is very                        important for the recovery and utilization of metals in                         view of the energy and environmental concerns in the U.S.                       and in India.  The two cooperating scientists, and the                          proposed U.S. participants are all well known and respected                     researchers in the field.  BARC is one of the largest and                       most productive research organizations in India.  The                           binational workshop should greatly enhance the potential                        for scientific collaboration between India and the U.S.",
