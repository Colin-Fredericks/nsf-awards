 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to upgrade a scanning transmission                    microscope with a field-emission gun which will be used for materials           research.  The State of New Jersey has provided funds to purchase a             conventional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope.  This award             allows for the purchase of a substantially upgraded, newly developed            Field Emission Gun-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope with               advanced capability.                                                            %%%                                                                             The instrument will be located at Stevens Institute of Technology in a          new microscopy facility being developed with state funds, and                   available through a consortia of 5 institutions in the New Jersey               area, the Advanced Technology Center for Surface Engineered Materials.          Consortia institutions include: New Jersey Institute of Technology,             Princeton University, Rutgers University, Stevens Institute of                  Technology, and David Sarnoff Research Center.  The consortia was               created to study surface and thin-film materials problems and is                headed by Dr. Bernard Kear, at Rutgers.   The Center at Stevens                 focusses on materials research problems related to surfaces and thin            films such as: interfaces in nanophase ceramics, ceramic/intermetallic          matrix composites, optoelectronic thin film crystallization, and                buffered superconducting thin films.  The instrument will be available          to members of the center and others from local universities and                 industries.",
