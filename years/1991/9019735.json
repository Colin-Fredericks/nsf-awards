 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research outlined in this proposal is designed to continue             the purification and characterization of the cyanide-resistant,                 \"alternative\" oxidase associated with the electron transfer chain               of mitochondria in most plants, many fungi and some protozoa.  The              role of this energetically wasteful oxidase in plant energy                     metabolism is not known and only recently has progress been made                identifying protein species associated with the oxidase.  The PI                has successfully carried out a partial purification of the                      alternative oxidase from the highly cyanide-resistant spadices of               flowering skunk cabbage.  This preparation will be further purified             and the cofactors associated with the oxygen reduction reaction                 catalyzed by the enzyme will be identified.  More specifically, the             nature and amount of an auto-oxidizable quinone found to be                     associated with the enzyme will be determined as will the nature                of any metals bound to the purified enzyme.  Studies will also be               carried out to determine the relative contributions of steric                   factors, redox potentials and quinone lipophilicity to the ability              of a given quinone species to serve as an electron donor to the                 alternative oxidase.  These studies will lead to a better under                 understanding of this unusual oxidase and the nature of its                     interaction with the mitochondrial electron transfer chain.                                                                                                          Unlike animals, such as humans, plants have two respiratory                pathways in their mitochondria.  One is similar to that found in                animals and is sensitive to (poisoned by) cyanide.  The second                  pathway, which shares the initial steps of the first pathway, does              not occur in animals and is cyanide resistant.  This second,                    alternative pathway is less efficient than the first in energy                  production.  Interest in the two pathways is heightened by the fact             that plants can regulate the flow of electrons between the two                  pathways.  Hence there are environmental and biological conditions              that favor the use of one pathway or the other.  The fact that the              alternative pathway is less efficient energetically raises the                  question of why the second pathway exists and is preferred under                certain conditions.  The experiments outlined in this proposal to               study the alternative oxidase will help to characterize the                     alternative oxidase and how it functions.",
