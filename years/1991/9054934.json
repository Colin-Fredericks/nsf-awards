 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaboration between NSF and CCSO to develop indicators of                science and mathematics education began in 1986.  The project was               initiated with two goals:  1) to establish a system of education                indicators that provides the capacity for national analyses and                 state-by-state comparisons of the condition and trends in science               mathematics education, and 2) to improve the quality and                        usefulness of data on science and mathematics education to assist               the state policymakers and program managers in making more                      informed decisions.                                                                  The present proposal outlines four objectives for the next                 phase of the state science/math indicators project:                             1.   Collect and report biannual national and state-by-state data                    on selected indicators of science and math education, based                     on data collected by state departments of education;                       2.   Produce and report state-by-state analyses of data on                           science and math indicators from the Schools and Staffing                       Survey of the National Center for Education Statistics;                    3.   Provide assistance to 5-10 states to develop capacity for                       collecting and reporting data on science/math indicators;                  4.   Establish an \"interstate consortium on alternative methods                      of student assessment\" to assist states in reforming their                      assessments of student learning in science and mathematics.",
