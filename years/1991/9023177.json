 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Malcolm G.                           McLaren, Director, Institute for Engineered Materials,                          Rutgers University, to conduct with Dr. Ahmad Tajuddin Ali,                     Controller, Standards and Industrial Research Institute of                      Malaysia (SIRIM),the 1990 U.S.-Malaysia Seminar on                              Innovation and Commercialization of Research,                                   November 12-16, 1990, at Genting Highlands and Kuala                            Lumpur, Malaysia.  The joint seminar will involve eight                         U.S. participants, who, with a like number of Malaysian                         participants, will address several topics of mutual                             interest.  A limited number of other Malaysian, ASEAN,                          and African scientists/engineers will be invited to                             participate as observers.  The purpose of this seminar                          is to bring together for mutual benefit U.S. and Malaysian                      scientists/engineers to exchange ideas on innovation and                        commercialization of research and, within the scope of the                      seminar, to identify priority areas for future                                  U.S.-Malaysian research cooperation.                                                                                                                            The Malaysian economy has shown a sustained rapid growth                        and diversification for most of the period from 1965 to the                     present with the exception of a decline due to falling                          commodity prices in 1985 and 1986.  Manufacturing has                           replaced agriculture as the Malaysian economy's largest                         sector, but commodities account for 45 percent of that                          country's exports.  Through its \"New Economic Policy\"                           (NEP), Malaysia seeks to strengthen its economy and                             become more competitive by using its labor community in a                       value-added mode.  Toward this end, Malaysia seeks                              technology transfer and a broader use of science for                            development.  The joint seminar will provide a unique                           opportunity for U.S. scientists/engineers to gain an                            insight into the state of development in Malaysia and the                       official policies which are guiding that rapid                                  development.  It is expected that this seminar will be                          instrumental in fostering future collaborative research                         that will be beneficial to the United States and Malaysia.                      This project is relevant to the objectives of the Science                       in Developing Countries Program which seeks to increase the                     level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers                      and their counterparts in developing countries through the                      exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                          techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                      benefit.  Support of non-U.S. participants is provided from                     sources other than the National Science Foundation.",
