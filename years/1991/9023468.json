High Tc instruments are expected to                                             offer better performance than non                                               superconducting counterparts,                                                   together with lower operating cost                                              than low Tc superconducting                                                     instruments.

The sense-loop, and                                              flux transformer technology can also                                            be applied to couple to a high Tc                                               SQUID, if they become more                                                      available.

We were able                                             to use the superconducting loop, or                                             \"antenna\", to couple external fields                                            into the fluxgate, and we were able                                             to use the fluxgate to demonstrate                                              the ability of the superconducting                                              loop, to carry a persistent current.
