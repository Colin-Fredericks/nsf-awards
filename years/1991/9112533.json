 "awd_abstract_narration": "Labor issues concerning public school teachers represent one of                 the most interesting and important areas of applied research in                 labor economics.  In an era of shrinking supply of teachers, the                educational system is also confronted with an alarming rate of                  teacher turnover.  The purpose of this research is to analyze                   teacher compensation and mobility.   A theoretical model is                     developed of the hiring and retention of overlapping cohorts of                 teacher.  By studying a bargaining model of contract determination              in which the preferences of the union's median voter plays a                    crucial role, it is possible to focus explicitly on the role of                 unions in the bargaining process.                                                                                                                               The model will be tested using an unusual data set of public school             teachers in Pennsylvania.  The data includes information on 100,000             teachers by school district, along with information on collective               bargaining contracts by school district.  By including all 501                  districts in the state throughout the 1980's, a large and detailed              set of panel data has been created which provides an extraordinary              opportunity to examine empirically the link between mobility and                collective bargaining.  This research is important because it will              shed new light on the effectiveness of education reform measures                aimed at attracting and retaining better teachers in the public                 schools.",
