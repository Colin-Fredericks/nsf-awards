 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine bivalve molluscs such as oysters, clams and mussels often                are found in habitats where oxygen availability may vary                        dramatically with time.  For instance, species which live in the                intertidal zone may go through daily cycles of air exposure at low              tides.  Most species close their shells to avoid desiccation.                   However, this results in a severe depletion of internal oxygen                  since the organism is effectively sealed from the respiratory                   environment.  Surprisingly, many of these species survive without               oxygen for extended periods due to the ability of their cells to                produce energy in the absence of oxygen.  One major drawback in                 making energy without oxygen is that metabolic acids accumulate as              waste products.  This study will investigate how the cells of these             animals deal with the metabolic acids produced during period of                 hypoxia.  Experiments will be conducted to see if cells from high               intertidal species (frequent exposure to oxygen deprivation) show               a higher capacity for dealing with these metabolic acids than cells             from low intertidal species (infrequent exposure to oxygen                      deprivation).  Additional studies will investigate whether the                  capacity for cells to cope with acid loads is enhanced when animals             are subjected to chronic oxygen stress.  These studies will provide             information on the unique mechanisms by which these animals are                 adapted to their habitats and also yield insights into general                  mechanisms applicable to higher organisms.//",
