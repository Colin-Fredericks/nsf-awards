 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Southern California will support shipboard               technician activities associated with the R/V VICKERS, a 220-foot               research vessel that is owned and operated by the University.  USC              has been converting the VICKERS to a research vessel from a tuna                clipper over the past five years.  Nearly all of the ship's                     operating schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF- sponsored                  research projects.  Some extra effort will go into setting up new               scientific equipment and getting the ship ready to do science.  The             Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea                      component and an ashore component.                                                   The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                    personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; maintenance,                repair, and calibration of scientific instrumentation; instruction              and supervision of deck operations; and providing logistics                     assistance to on-coming and off-going scientific parties.  On shore             activities include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of                  shared use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in             preparing for field work on the vessel.  Shipboard technicians                  funded by this award have broad responsibilities for providing the              coordination and assistance needed for the successful completion of             research projects at sea.  The level of activity and amount of                  support are closely related to the size and capability of the                   vessel, and its scientific outfit and capability.",
