 "awd_abstract_narration": "Positive novolak resists are by far the most important patterning               systems of today's semiconductor technology, yet their functional               mechanism is not well understood.  This research deals with a                   mechanistic model of resist function, which if validated and                    completed would provide a rational basis for the further                        technical development of these important materials.                                                                                                             It was recently shown that novolak dissolution in aqueous alkali                is controlled by the rate of diffusion of the base into the solid               polymer.  It is now suggested that diffusion of the electrolyte                 into novolak follows a path defined by hydrophilic centers i.e.                 the OH-groups of the resin, and avoids the hydrophobic regions of               the matrix.  Dissolution inhibitors function by interrupting                    these hydrophilic diffusion channels.  It is proposed to validate               the concept of hydrophilic diffusion pathways by designing resins               with a varying concentration of phenols and in this way vary the                separation of hydrophilic sites and monitor the effect of site                  dilution on dissolution rate.",
