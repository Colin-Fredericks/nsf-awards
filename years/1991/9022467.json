 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds for the analysis of the data obtained                 from a sodium lidar the was operated at South Pole throughout 1990              and also to begin the development of improved lidar systems for a               new South Pole lidar facility.  The earlier instrument made                     measurements of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), which play an                important role in the development of the annual stratospheric ozone             hole, and also measured the motions of the sodium layer near the                mesopause (approximately 90 km altitude) to elucidate the dynamics              of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MALT) region.  It is                  expected that the proposed new lidar facility will be built in                  conjunction with colleagues from the University of Rome with the                support of the Italian Antarctic Program.  The improved lidar                   systems will be able to measure high altitude temperatures and also             determine the characteristics of stratospheric aerosols as well as              detect PSCs and the sodium layer.                                                                                                                               These studies are important for the understanding of stratospheric              chemistry and the causes of polar ozone depletion and for                       understanding the dynamics of the MALT region.  There will be a                 significant contribution to the Coupling of Energetics and Dynamics             through Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) initiative.
