 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is rapidly becoming an                          invaluable research tool with applications in fields as diverse                 as molecular biology, medicine and forensics.  We feel that the                 introduction of PCR technology into our undergraduate                           curriculum is essential to maintain our practice of teaching                    current research techniques in molecular biophyscis and                         biochemistry. Especially those that are in widespread use and                   are likely to be encountered by our students in their future                    careers.  We are requesting funding to purchase the temperature                 cycler needed for the repetitive denaturation and renaturation                  steps that form the basis of this technique.We are also                         requesting funds to purchase a spectrophotometer to be used to                  teach a variety of topics including introductory and advanced                   enzyme kinetics and investigations into the optical properties                  of nucleic acids, e.g. thermal denaturationEach of these pieces                 of equipment will be used in undergraduate teaching labs at                     Yale University both semesters of the academic year by majors                   and non-majors alike.",
