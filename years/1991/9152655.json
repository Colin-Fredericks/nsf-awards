 "awd_abstract_narration": "An advanced electronics laboratory using computer-based data                    acquisition and analysis instrumentation is being developed at                  Franklin Institute of boston for its technology majors.  The                    instrumentation consists of six workstations, each with a 386-                  based AT personal computer with internal boards for use as: a                   digital logic analyzer (DLA); and, an analog instrumentation                    system (AIS) comprised of a digital oscilloscope, function                      generator and multimeter. The DLA will improve the timing                       analysis of a microprocessor-based system bus architecture. The                 AIS will allow a further explanation of electronics and                         electrical circuits through its capability to extract data and                  its software manipulation in frequency and characteristic curve                 analysis. The students using this laboratory are in the 2nd                     year of two-year engineering technology programs, and they will                 have had one year of electrical and electronic circuits.  The                   project is significant because it implements an efficient,                      cost-effective system, of a type currently utilized in the                      private sector, that will improve our students' educational                     experience while preparing them for a career in industry.  By                   demonstrating the efficacy of this system and developing the                    accompanying instructional materials, the project plans to                      facilitate the implementation of computer-based electronic                      laboratories by other educational institutions.",
