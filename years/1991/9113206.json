 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Minority Research Planning Grant project is supported                      through  the Office of Special Projects and the Analytical and                  Surface Chemistry Program in Chemistry and involves the use of                  layered, sheet-like, clays as selective adsorbants for                          separations.  The adsorption process takes place in spaces                      between clay plates which act as molecular sieves.  Clays where                 the aluminosilicate plates are negatively charged and counter                   cations of sodium are inserted between the clay layers will be                  studied.  The sodium ions can be exchanged by larger cations in                 order to expand the spacing of the layered clays and create                     void volumes where permeation can occur.  Clays that are                        modified in this manner will be designed for use in size                        exclusion chromatography.                                                       %%%                                                                             Minority Research Planning Grants are intended to strengthen                    the proposal writing and planning capabilities of new                           investigators and to facilitate preliminary studies and other                   planning activities related to the research.  This project will                 involve extensive interaction with senior researchers at                        Michigan State University during the formulation of research                    ideas and the preparation of the research proposal.",
