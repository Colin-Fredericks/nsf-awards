 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Program in Molecular Biology and               Biotechnology, an independent campus-wide unit created to promote               genetic engineering research and education at the University of                 North Carolina, Chapel Hill, to continue its Research Experiences               for Undergraduates (REU) Site for an additional three years.                    Academically promising students chosen from a national pool will                participate in ongoing research carried out by a select group of                PMBB faculty.  Emphasis will be placed on recruitment of students               with limited research opportunities and on students from groups                 historically under-represented in the sciences.  A total of 12                  REU students will participate.  Nine students will be funded by                 the NSF, two students will be funded by the UNC School of                       Medicine, and one student will be supported with funds from the                 Division of Health Affairs.  The overall goals are to (1)                       introduce students to a diversity of biological research and                    techniques, particularly in molecular biology and molecular                     genetics, (2) familiarize students with the process of                          independent research, (3) promote development of laboratory and                 communication skills, and (4) provide guidance to aid students in               selection of graduate programs.  To meet these goals students                   will (1) work for ten weeks with faculty on projects having                     meaningful scientific objectives and derived from ongoing                       research, (2) attend weekly research topic discussions with each                faculty preceptor, (3) attend a meeting in which Directors of                   Graduate Studies from various departments provide students with                 advice and information about Ph.D. programs (4) visit campus                    scientific core facilities (eg, protein sequencing and analysis),               laboratories at the UNC Hospitals that employ molecular                         techniques in medical diagnoses (eg, DNA Diagnostic Facility),                  and pharmaceutical establishments in Research Triangle Park, and                (4) present the results of their research in talks before the                   campus community.",
