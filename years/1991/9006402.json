 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to characterize the structure and                function of the plant vacuolar H+-ATPase.  The specific goals of                the project are (i) to determine the complete subunit composition               by further purification and immunoprecipitation; (ii) to study                  the subunit organization by dissociating and identifying the                    peripheral subunits; (iii) to deduce the primary structure and                  later to define the functional domains of selected subunits by                  cloning and sequencing the gene encoding the 16 kDa proteolipid;                (iv) to test the function of the 16 kDa proteolipid by                          reconstitution and molecular genetic methods; (v) to localize the               subcellular distribution of the ATPase; and (vi) to begin                       preliminary studies on the biosynthesis of selected ATPase                      subunits.                                                                                                                                                       Plant cells contain a large central vacuole that occupies up to                 80% of the cell volume.  They are important for maintaining cell                turgor and for the storage of ions and metabolites.  Transport                  processes across the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) are controlled               by electrochemical gradients that are determined in part by the                 tonoplast localized vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPases) which is a                      proton-pumping ATPase (H+-ATPase).  The V-ATPases represent a                   class of ATPase that is present in the endomembrane system of all               eukaryotic cells.  Thus, investigations on the structure and                    function of the plant vacuolar ATPase has relevance to the                      function of the endomembrane system in all higher organisms.",
