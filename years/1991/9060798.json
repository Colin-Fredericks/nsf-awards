 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research and development program is proposed that would                       produce an instrument capable of providing real time                            measurements of both NO and soot concentrations in internal                     combustion engine exhaust.  This instrument would be capable                    of monitoring transients in emission with a resolution                          approximately equivalent to one engine cycle.  The necessity                    for this instrument is clear:  federal and international air                    quality standards are becoming stringent enough to mandate a                    significant increase of emission production as a function of                    the specifics of engine operation.  Information derived from                    the proposed measurement system would allow engine                              manufacturers to critically assess their engines performance                    over their engine operating envelope.  The key to the                           technical approach is to measure concentrations of both NO and                  soot with absorption/extinction diagnostics in the infrared                     and package the instrument in a fashion that facilitates its                    application to engine test stands.                                                                                                                              This research is of direct interest to the internal combustion                  engine manufacturing community.  The outgrowth of the proposed                  effort would be an instrument capable of monitoring transient                   emission behavior in engines.",
