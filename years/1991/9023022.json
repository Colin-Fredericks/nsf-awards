 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although a great deal is known about how the characteristics of                 individuals and economic outcomes are related, much less is known               about the association between characteristics of firms (other than              size and unionization) and labor market phenomena. A key                        characteristic of firms is their age. This project will focus on                the  age related differences in the survival-relevant                           characteristics of firms as well as attributes such as firm size                or industry.                                                                                                                                                    The project begins with an analysis of firm age and wages,                      including the size and sign of the relationship on average and                  checks for departures from this norm across settings. An attempt                will be made to explain why such differentials exist and how they               can persist in reasonable competitive product markets.                                                                                                          Existing data sets will be utilized for the analysis, including the             Minimum Wage Employer Survey and the British Workplace Industrial               Relations Survey. However, a major part of the project will involve             matching estimates of age of employer to observations in data files             which lack an explicit measure of employer age but have large                   samples and more detail on worker characteristics. Specifically,                the Dun and Bradstreet or the Bureau of Economic Analysis County                Business Patterns  which obtain information on average age of firm              by industry size and region will be matched to individual records               in the Current Population Survey. In addition, a supplement to the              Survey of Consumers would include questions which would enable                  worker characteristics to be controlled for. This new data set                  would be made available through a data archive for other                        researchers in economics.",
