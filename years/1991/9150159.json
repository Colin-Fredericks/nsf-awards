 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pratt Museum, a natural history museum in                              Southcentral Alaska, proposes to bring before the public an                     exhibition on oil pollution.  Using the historic disaster of                    the March 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdez, the museum                        presents a dramatic, grassroots story of the desperate                          struggle to protect the environment and preserve traditional                    lifestyles.  The exhibit's purpose is to increase public                        awareness of national and global issues pertaining to the                       development, transportation, and use of petroleum.  The                         1,500 square foot presentation shows what an oil spill is                       like through photographs, maps, graphics, and three-                            dimensional participatory elements.  The exhibit is                             scheduled to open at the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural                        History in early 1991, beginning a three-year tour of 12                        museums that will reach between 1.5 and 2 million viewers.                                                                                                           The NSF contribution will support the circulation of                       the exhibit and the development of interactive components to                    enhance both the permanent and traveling presentations.                         Computerized graphic displays and an educational chest of                       learning tools will enhance the basic exhibit through multi-                    sensory activities designed for hands-on gallery use,                           increasing accessibility for children and disabled visitors.                                                                                                         This cooperative project invloves private foundations,                     individuals, the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish                     and Wildlife Service, and Alaska Department of Fish and                         Game.",
