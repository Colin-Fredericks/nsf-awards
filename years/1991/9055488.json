Each of four                     institutes will be held at a college or university site                         facilitated by a site coordinator who is a professor of                         science and a team of four (PAs) who will serve as                              instructors.  Each PA team will include a chemistry,                            physics, biology, and earth science teacher.  Potential                         institute sites for 1992 include the State University of New                    York, Purchase, University of North Carolina, Wilmington,                       Purdue University, West Lafayette, and Southern Oregon State                    College, Ashland.                                                                                                                                               Each institute will accommodate 30 participants for a total                     of 360 middle level teachers in the three-year project.  The                    institute programs will be structured to include content in                     science, teaching methodology, cooperative team building,                       and special lectures on leading-edge science topics.  In                        addition, special sessions on leadership training,                              conducting peer-led workshop, reviewing curriculum                              materials, and securing funding will be held.  An                               instructional syllabus and a site coordinator's handbook                        will be produced to provide program consistency at each                         site.                                                                                                                                                           The aim of APAST/NSTA institutes is to obtain a mix of                          science teachers for different geographic areas and a                           variety of teaching circumstances to foster an exchange of                      experiences and view points.  Teachers will be selected                         based on perceived need, leadership potential, and                              willingness to secure district funds for follow-up                              activities.                                                                                                                                                     At the workshops, participants will prepare lesson plans                        based on content learned at the institutes.  Compilations of                    the teaching materials will be distributed to all                               participants, site coordinators, and members of APAST.  In                      addition, all participants will conduct at least one peer-                      led inservice workshop in their school districts or at an                       educational convention in the fall.  Mini-grants will be                        made available to participants who have completed and                           returned an inservice report form and have presented a                          rationale for the funds as well as an itemized budget and                       evidence of cost sharing on the part of their school                            district.                                                                                                                                                       Evaluation will address content and pedagogy gain by                            participants through the administration of pre-and post-                        standardized science content tests.  In addition, three                         teachers in each workshop will be followed over a three year                    period as case studies.  The project evaluator will document                    professional growth of these selected individuals through                       telephone interviews and response forms. Mr. Robert Lewis,                      President-elect of APAST and a Presidential Awardee, is the                     Principal Investigator and                                                      Ms. Marily DeWall of NSTA is the Co-PI.
