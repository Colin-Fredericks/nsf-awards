 "awd_abstract_narration": "The questions of the value of scientific research and the proper                role of this research versus teaching are hotly contested.                      Stanford University, for example, is this year trying a new                     approach to shift the emphasis more toward teaching and,                        implicitly, away from research in evaluating faculty for critical               tenure decisions.  Working with Dr. John Heilbron of the History                of Science and Technology Program of the University of California               at Berkeley, Dr. Assmus is examining the history of the growth of               physics research, and more generally scientific research, from the              1920's to the 1950's from the perspective of a major state                      university.  Specifically, she is examining the growth of research              and its balance with teaching through a biographical study of                   Raymond T. Birge.  Birge, a physicist, was chair of the department              of physics at the University of California, Berkeley during                     critical years (1932-1955) before and immediately after World War               II.  A look at the historical development of the research                       university and its relation to national life should shed light on               decisions about the proper balance between research and teaching.               The Birge papers are kept at Berkeley.  John Heilbron, with his                 extensive knowledge of the history of quantum physics and American              science, and his skill at writing scientific biographies, is an                 ideal mentor for this project.",
