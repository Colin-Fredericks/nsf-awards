 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Brigham Young Herbarium contains approximately 350,000                 specimens, primarily from the state of Utah.  The holdings of                   this herbarium probably constitute the world's best                             representation of the plants of this area.  This collection has                 been used extensively for preparation of the Intermountain Flora                and the Flora of Utah, and this herbarium is the primary resource               for our understanding of the transition between the floras of the               Rocky Mountains to the east and the Great Basin to the West.                    Research on the biogeography of the American West benefits                      greatly from this collection.  Dr. Stanley Welsh, Curator of the                Herbarium, has been responsible for the collection's steady                     growth over the past decades, and he now proposes to install a                  new storage system of movable \"compatorized\" herbarium cases.                   This improvement will support many years of continued growth of                 the collection.                                                                      Natural history collections such as the Brigham Young                      Herbarium constitute the a valuable resource for understanding                  the diversity of life on earth.  They are indispensable to                      research in many fields of science, including but not limited to                systematic and evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, and                 conservation.  The continued support and improvement of these                   collections will provide future generations of investigators with               access to critical research resources.",
