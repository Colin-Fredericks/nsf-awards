 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twenty years ago, the Supreme Court adopted new statutes with                   explicit sentencing guidelines for jurors in capital cases in an                attempt to remedy arbitrariness in sentencing decisions.  Since                 then the Supreme Court and lower courts have been basing decisions              on the assumption that jurors can and do base their penalty                     decisions on the guidelines provided.  Studies of the outcomes of               jury decisions in capital cases suggest that impermissible factors              (notably race) still influence jury decisions of life or death even             under sentencing guidelines approved by the Court.  To date, there              are very few studies of how death penalty jurors actually arrive                at these decisions.                                                                                                                                             This study will illuminate how jurors make decisions by seeking to              develop a clearer understanding of the exercise of discretion and               of the sources and extent of arbitrariness in capital sentencing                decisions.  Extensive interviews will be conducted with 120 jurors              from 30 capital trials in each of 8 states.  Judges, prosecutors,               and defense attorneys in these cases will also be interviewed.  The             study adopts an integrated theoretical approach which examines what             decision models jurors employ, what forms of arbitrariness and/or               discrimination occur, and how the two are linked.  Several                      alternative models will be tested.  Formal rational algebraic                   decision models of jury sentencing behavior will be used.  Also,                theoretical formulations labeled \"story\" and \"matching\" decision                models will be employed.  Finally, labeling and conflict theories               will consider the role of social agents as dominant groups in                   applying the law against subordinate groups.  Individual jurors                 are the primary units of analysis.                                                                                                                              This study is unique in its interdisciplinary approach and in its               linkages between statutory/procedural aspects of the law and the                actual decision models jurors adopt.  Not only does the research                promise to enhance our understanding of the way in which                        decisionmakers exercise discretion and arrive at legal judgments,               but also it will provide information helpful in improving the                   administration of justice in criminal cases.",
