A general methodology is                                            developed, interfacing direct                                                   simulations, model reduction, and                                               modern stability and bifurcation                                                algorithms.  This procedure will be                                             validated on a number of                                                        representative engineering problems                                             in complex geometries, involving and                                            reaction phenomena.

A                                                  Galerkin weighted residual                                                      formulation employing these global                                              modes yields low-dimensional                                                    accurate dynamic models, which can                                              subsequently be used to analyze                                                 spatial and temporal system                                                     behavior, including stability and                                               transition to time-periodic and                                                 chaotic states.                                                                                                                                                 The proposed methodology can be                                                 expected to become a standard                                                   powerful computational tool for                                                 studying the dynamic behavior of                                                realistic engineering systems.                                                  Furthermore, the low-dimensional                                                engineering models resulting from                                               this methodology will be useful in                                              a wide variety of applications, from                                            modeling and analysis, to design,                                               prediction and control of spatially                                             extended systems.",
