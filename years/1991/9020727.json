 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Dagdigian is supported by a grant from the                            Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the chemical                   reactions between fragments of molecules in crossed molecular                   beams by analysing the light emitted by the products upon laser                 excitation.  The motivation for these studies is to answer the                  question:  What is the effect of having many possible potential                 energy surfaces on which these reactions occur on the                           distribution of product molecules and on the energy states in                   which they are produced?                                                                                                                                        In this project the dynamics of reactions involving molecular                   free radicals will be experimentally investigated through the                   determination of product internal state distributions using the                 laser fluorescence detection technique.  Because of the                         unpaired electrons on both reagents, these reactions                            necessarily involve multiple potential energy surfaces.  The                    influence of the different surfaces should be manifest in the                   branching between different product channels.  The reactions of                 oxygen atoms with vibrationally excited reagents, which will be                 prepared by stimulated Raman excitation, will be probed through                 measurement of the hydroxyl product internal distribution.",
