 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biaxial creep behavior is studied in hexagonal close packed metals              and alloys that have been processed with varied textures,                       microstructures, and operating slip systems.  Investigations on the             transitional creep mechanisms from power law to viscous creep and               the effects of texture on these transitions are being examined.                 Several metals and alloys have been selected for the studies to                 provide materials with vastly different textures.  Microstructural              studies are accomplished using scanning transmission electron                   microscopy to determine dislocation structures and optical                      metallography to aid in slip trace analysis.                                    %%%                                                                             The research is seen as valuable to the high temperature use of                 metal alloys and for better understanding of their behavior under               biaxial stresses.  Hexagonal close packed metals are used in                    aerospace and energy industries where they are exposed to high                  temperatures and complex loading conditions.  Improved                          understanding of creep under these conditions should lead to                    techniques to take advantage of textural hardening and to predict               anisotropic deformation.",
