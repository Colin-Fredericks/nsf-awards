The students' interest, confidence, and enthusiasm for science will be          heightened.  This age group was selected to affect future curricula             choices.  Participants learn basic research methodology, gain discipline        content, and perform research under the direction of senior faculty.            Ethical considerations are integrated into daily activities.  Special           sessions focus on the values and philosophies practitioners and citizens        must consider.  Career Exploration opportunities include developing             \"Personal Plans\" and visits to regional practitioners of science to see         \"what scientists do.\"                                                                                                                                           Follow-up involves school visits, campus speakers, and student                  presentations in the Junior Science Academy.  Project assessment                includes short and long term follow up.",
