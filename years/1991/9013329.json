 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most representations of the hydrologic cycle assume that nearly            all precipitation over land surfaces reaches the ground, but depending          on the nature of vegetation growing from the surface, significant               amounts of moisture may be intercepted by plant surfaces.  Previous             research indicates that interception rates are highest in tropical              rainforests, where tree canopies are most dense.  As tropical forests           are cleared, the amount of moisture falling directly onto the ground            may therefore dramatically increase, further exacerbating the                   microclimatological changes that result from deforestation.  No                 accurate measurements of the amounts of moisture intercepted by tree            canopies have been made, however, so estimates of the volume of water           flows from the atmosphere through vegetative surfaces to the ground             remain conjectural.  This project will test a new procedure to measure          the amount of precipitation that passes through successive levels of            tree canopies to the land surface.  Such measurements are complicated           by high winds that blow raindrops horizontally through the treetops.  A         geographic information system-based, three-dimensional model of air and         moisture flow through cyclone-prone tropical rainforests will be                developed and tested at a study site on the Atherton Tableland of               Queensland in northeastern Australia.  Wind sensors, tipping-bucket and         tilted rain gauges, and instruments to measure the angle of inclined            rainfall will be used to gather data for testing the model.                          This research project will provide an effective test of a new              model and methods for measuring the amount of moisture intercepted by           tree canopies.  Although initially calibrated for tropical rainforests,         the model and methods will be adaptable for other types of biomes.  The         data gathered using these methods and the refined model will permit             testing of important hypotheses about the nature and volume of water            movements among the atmosphere, vegetative surfaces, and the ground.            It therefore will enhance our understandings of a critical part of the          hydrologic cycle and will improve models of atmospheric-terrestrial             interaction.  Because new insights will be gained on the dynamics of            tropical rainforests, this project also will increase our understanding         of these critical areas of especially great environmental change.",
