 "awd_abstract_narration": "A graduate and an undergraduate student (both minorities)                     will work with a chemist at Clark Atlanta University in                         conducting comprehensive research to prepare and                                study the physical and mechanical properties of films and                       fibers.  This will be achieved by preparing polymers which                      are chemical precursors to poly (p-phenylene-2, 6-                              benzobisoxazole) (PBO) and poly (p-phenylene                                    benzobisthiazole) (PBT) which are normally very intractable                     and difficult to process.  The precursors will be designed                      to have higher solubility and lower melting points by                           decreasing the symmetry and preventing hydrogen bonding.                        Once processed into films or fibers the precursor polymers                      will be converted to PBO and PBT by high yield chemical                         transformations.                                                                  The precursor polymers and polymers will be characterized by                  techniques including infrared microscopy and spectroscopy,                      and 1H, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, light                      scattering photometry, differential scanning calorimetry,                       thermogravimetric analysis, polarizing optical microscopy,                      gel permeation chromatography, solubility, viscometry and x-                    ray diffraction.  Physical testing, such as, tensile                            strength measurements will be performed on films and fibers                     made from the precursors and polymers, before and after                         transformation to PBT and PBO.",
