 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support for Wightman's research in the development and use of                   ultramicroelectrodes has been renewed by the Analytical and                     Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.  Study                     will focus in three areas: mechanisms of electrochemically                      generated chemiluminescence (ECL), ultra-high speed cyclic                      voltammetry (UHS-CV), and electrochemical detection of species                  in supercritical fluids (SCF).  Extension of Wightman's                         previous work in UHS-CV will lead to electrochemical methods                    nearly as fast as optical (laser) time-resolved methods,                        permitting redox chemistry to be studied by complementary                       techniques for the first time.  ECL experiments require this                    high speed for elucidation of branching of excited redox                        species into various decay paths.  Few techniques for detecting                 solutes in SCF exist, so Wightman's efforts in this area                        promise to provide an important, species selective method for                   detecting reactive solutes.                                                                                                                                     %%%                                                                                                                                                             This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                          Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, continues                          development of ultramicroelectordes for electrochemical                         detection of oxidizable or reducable species.  Small size                       allows very rapid experiments to be done, so that observation                   of reactions which occur on a time scale of nanoseconds becomes                 possible.  Among the applications of this novel technology are                  studies of species which emit light as a consequence of                         electrochemical reaction (electrically generated                                chemiluminescence) and detection of species dissolved in                        supercritical fluids (fluids which are gases at room                            temperature unless highly compressed).",
