 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a \"U.S.-Australian Cooperative                          Workshop: Ions and Water in Biological and Synthetic Membranes\"                 to be held 10-16 August 1991 in Honolulu, Hawaii, and to be                     organized by Dr. David Deamer of the University of California-                  Davis and Dr. Bruce Cornell of the Australian Commonwealth                      Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO).                        Membranes play central roles in cellular processes, parti-                      cipating in energy transduction reactions, ion and nutrient                     transport, and homeostatic regulation of the intracellular                      environment.  In order to better understand such processes,                     it is essential to answer certain fundamental questions about                   membrane function and structure at the molecular level.                                                                                                         Both U.S. and Australia have significant scientific strength                    in the area of membrane biophysics. However, this expertise                     has grown up largely in isolation with only occasional                          interaction between the scientists of these countries in this                   field. For this reason, this workshop, in addition to                           promoting exchange of scientific information, has as a                          primary goal the development of new U.S.-Australian collab-                     orations to advance understanding of membrane structure and                     function. Themes of the conference include: molecular                           structure of membrane proteins and peptides; membrane                           lipidsand lipid-peptide interactions; and the bioenergetics of                  ion conductance. Exploration of these research themes has in                    several cases generated potential applications, particularly                    in pharmaceutical, biotechnological, diagnostic, and                            microelectronic industries. While the workshop will focus on                    furthering improved basic understanding of membrane function                    and structure at the molecular level, participation will also                   include experts who are developing commercial applications                      related to basic research in membrane biophysics.",
