 "awd_abstract_narration": "A versatile NMR probe has been designed and constructed.  This                  probe is capable of performing low signal to noise spin-                        lattice relaxation and diffusion coefficient measurements at                    pressures up to 600 atm over a temperature range of -20 to                      200oC.  The probe is also configured so that vapor liquid                       equilibrium can be established in the sample at these                           temperatures and pressures.  In the immediate future the probe                  will be used to measure relaxation times (T1) and self                          diffusion coefficients in 13CO2 as a function of temperature                    and pressure.  The only T1 measurements on this important                       fluid are the four isochores measured by Smith and coworkers                    (1986).  Several investigators have measured the self-                          diffusion coefficient of CO2 over the temperature range                         accessible to the probe, but the measurements are confined to                   pressures less than 200 atm.  After the pure CO2 measurements,                  mixtures of CO2 and n-hexadecane will be studied.  This data                    will then be correlated with classical transport properties.                    This type of correlation remains relatively unexplored for                      mixtures.  A global corresponding states treatment will also                    be attempted throughout this project.                                                                                                                           NMR can supply a wealth of information about the motions of                     molecules in all phases of matter.  From the relaxation times,                  the rotational and translational motions may be investigated.                   The diffusion coefficients, measured by the spin-echo method,                   provide a means to investigate translational motions.  In the                   past several years NMR imaging has been established as a                        valuable tool in the investigation of fluid flow in porous                      media.  A major challenge in the usefulness of this technique                   lies in relating the NMR measurables to traditional                             thermodynamic and transport properties.  The interrelationship                  is shown in Figure 1.  The purpose of our current NMR program,                  is to further develop and quantify some of the relationships                    between NMR measurables, transport properties, and state                        variables.  One area which would benefit greatly from the                       development of these relationships is the interpretation and                    quantification of NMR images.  Practical use of NMR imaging                     requires a correlation to bridge the NMR data with traditional                  engineering analysis.",
