 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Secondary Mathematics and Computer Science                    Education is a national program at Kent State University for                    secondary school teachers of mathematics and computer science,                  and was funded originally through Teacher Enhancement in 1988.                  The original program has been streamlined and reshaped to                       include a substantial emphasis on implementation and school                     change. In the summers of 1991 and 1992 a cadre of 60 teachers                  will study topics in computer science, data analysis, discrete                  mathematics, number theory, geometry, and abstract algebra.                     Current thinking from research in mathematics pedagogy                          pervades the program. The summer institute is six weeks long.                   As a central feature, teachers prepare to implement project                     philosophy and ideas in their classrooms and schools through                    the development of instructional units and preparation to                       conduct inservice. During the academic year, project staff and                  previous participants will support teachers in their                            implementation and outreach efforts through local meetings and                  school visits. Institute participants are brought together                      twice annually in a formal conference, and meet in small                        groups at other times. It is an expectation that participants                   or participant teams from a region conduct a series of four                     day-long inservices sessions locally. Project staff includes                    nationally known mathematicians, computer scientists, and                       educators. This program is attempting to make a transition to                   a permanent, self-supporting institute, and efforts toward                      this transition are central to the current project.                                                                                                             Cost sharing is provided by Kent State University and the Ohio                  Board of Regents as 19 % of the NSF award.",
