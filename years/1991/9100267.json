 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experiences for Undergraduates project involving                12 students will be supported by this award.  The students will                 work for ten weeks under the supervision of seven faculty                       advisors.  Other funds will provide support for additional                      students bringing the total size of the group to about 20.  The                 grant renews funding of successful projects of similar size                     carried out during the past three years.  Although many of the                  participants have not yet graduated, at least seven are known to                be enrolled in graduate study in mathematics and computer                       science.                                                                             The program is structured so that each student works with                  two subgroups.  They focus on several problems initially until                  one emerges as the most promising.  The themes are geometric                    although the term SMALL in the title is an acronym representing                 the initials of the first group of advisors and is not used as an               adjective.  Typical problems areas will include questions                       involving knot theory.  Students will consider how an analysis of               the crossings of knots can provide information about their                      general classification.  These ideas are related to others in                   graph theory in that certain knots can be embedded in graphs.                   One would like to characterize such graphs.  Other topics include               the calculation of topological characteristics called Betti                     numbers, vector-valued Hermitian forms arising in the                           differential geometry of Cauchy-Riemann structures and work in                  analytic number theory on the divisor problem for arithmetic                    progressions.                                                                        Students will be recruited from the New England area.                      Efforts will be made see that the research continues after the                  summer ends.  This will be particularly true of the students who                are recruited from Williams College.  It is expected that several               publishable papers will result from the project and that some                   students will have the opportunity to present their work at                     professional meetings.",
