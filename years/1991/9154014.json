 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eclipse| is a one-hour program within the prime-time                        series NOVA, to be broadcast nationally during the 1991-92                      season on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).  The                           program will document the total eclipse of the sun that                         takes place on July 11, 1991, and the research performed at                     the observatories located atop Mauna Kea on the Big Island                      of Hawaii.  The program will trace three narrative lines.                       The first will be that of the eclipse itself and its                            importance for ongoing scientific investigation of the solar                    corona and solar physics.  The second will be that of                           ongoing problems in understanding the sun, especially the                       issue of solar variability.  The third will place this                          eclipse within the history of eclipse science.  The passage                     of an eclipse over a major observatory complex is a unique                      occurrence -- it has never happened before, and will not                        happen again for several generations.  The four minutes of                      totality will allow solar astronomers to turn deep space                        instruments on the sun for the first time.  At the same                         moment, however, this eclipse marks what many observers feel                    is the end of a 130 year research program.  Eclipse| will                       provide its audience with a portrait of a spectacular                           natural phenomenon and of scientists attempting in real-time                    to tease new knowledge out of the sun.  In addition to its                      broadcast, Eclipse| will be seen in an estimated 70-90,000                      classrooms over a seven year period.",
