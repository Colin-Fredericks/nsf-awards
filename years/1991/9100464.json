 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop on salt lake                      ecosystems to be held in Bolivia in March, 1991.  The U.S.                      organizer is Stuart Hurlbert of San Diego State University.                     His counterpart in Bolivia is Carlos Arce of the League for                     the Defense of the Environment.  In addition there is an                        organizing committee consisting of three other scientists,                      three from Bolivia and one from France.  The participants                       include scientists from a wide spectrum of disciplines                          ranging from brine geochemistry to crustacean systematics to                    avian ecology.  They represent 24 different countries; 19                       arefrom Latin America, 32 from North America, 22 from                           Europe,4 from Africa, 4 from the Mideast, 5 from Russia, 6                      from Australia and 7 from Asia.                                                                                                                                 The workshop will include contributed and invited talks,                        panel discussions, field trips to saline lakes and a six-day                    excursion after the meeting to view saline lakes and the                        general geography of the altiplano (high plane).  This is the                   first of these symposia to be held in Latin America and                         therefore represents an important opportunity for Latin                         American scientists to interact with U.S. and world scientists                  in this field.  In this way, this activity fulfills the goals                   of the Science in Developing Countries program.",
