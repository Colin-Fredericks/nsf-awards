 "awd_abstract_narration": "In addition to reducing vegetation that may mitigate the effects of          increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the clearance of large              tracts of forest also is feared because it may reduce the diversity of          plant and animal species.  One facet of declining biological diversity          is the loss of plants that have medicinal qualities.  It is generally           assumed that undisturbed, old-growth forests in tropical areas represent        more plentiful locales for plants used by native healers.  Because many         modern pharmaceuticals have been developed from tropical medicinal              plants, preservation of old-growth forests therefore is believed to be          especially important.  This project tests the validity of the assumption        that underlies this belief by testing the hypothesis that areas from            which old-growth vegetation has been removed in order to establish              second-growth forests, cocoa plantations, or degraded pastures may              actually be more significant sources of medicinal plants for native             healers than are old-growth stands.  Working in carefully selected              sample sites near the Pau Brasil Ecological Reserve in eastern Brazil,          the investigator will identify medicinal plant species in each plot with        the help of local healers.  Complementary inventories of plant species          in each plot will permit generalization of the impacts of four general          land-use regimes on the diversity of medicinal plant species.                      This project will provide new data and understandings of value in a          number of different ways.  It will expand information about native              medical practices and about the uses of different types of plants by            healers with different medical traditions.  It also will provide a              direct test of hypotheses dealing with the number and types of plants           found in undisturbed forests and in sites that have been altered in             different ways by human activity.  The project therefore should enhance         understandings of the impacts of human activity of biological diversity         in an important environmental setting.",
