 "awd_abstract_narration": "In his recent book, Explaining Science (1988), Professor Giere                  argued that theories in science are to be understood as families                of models, which are abstract, non-linguistic entities.  He claimed             that the relationship between models and the world is to be                     understood in terms of similarity.  He also suggested that further              understanding of what models are, and how they are used, must come              not only from logic or mathematics, but also from work in the                   cognitive sciences (Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Psychology,              Linguistics, Philosophy, Neuroscience) which is focused on the                  general nature of representation.   The goal of this project is to              explore,in greater detail, recent work on representation to see to              what extent this work might indeed provide both an empirical and                theoretical basis for the exploration of his own account of                     representation in science.",
