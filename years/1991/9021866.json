 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Harvey              Mudd College for the renovation and repair of Jacobs Science Center             which houses the research and research training activities of the               Departments of Chemistry and Physics.  This building was                        constructed in 1959 and last renovated in 1960.  The ARFMP grant of             $1,025,000 and $1,025,090 provided by the grantee as cost sharing               will be used to modernize these research and research training                  facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                  current research infrastructure in terms of health and safety as                well as of the quality, quantity, and diversity of research that                can be carried out.  The modernization will involve gutting the                 building, restructuring laboratories, and completely rebuilding the             electrical, plumbing, safety, and heating, ventilation, and air                 conditioning (HVAC) systems.  The renovation will result not only               in the ability to maintain, but also in a significant enhancement               of, the already excellent level of research training.                                                                                                           This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of quality undergraduate students              in the Chemistry and Physics Departments which are projected to                 have a large increase in the number of majors.  Harvey Mudd, a                  science college with a highly regarded curriculum, traditionally                sends two-thirds of its baccalaureates to graduate school.",
