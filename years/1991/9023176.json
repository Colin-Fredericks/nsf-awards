 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Narrative:  A collaborative research project is                       proposed between Dr. Gordon's laboratory, University of                         Washington, Seattle and Dr. Riazuddin's laboratory, Centre for                  Advanced Molecular Biology, Lahore, Pakistan.  Their research                   will evaluate the potential of transgenic plant technology to                   manage and control important crop pests.  These studies will                    address three main objectives.  First, pesticidal genes will be                 identified in the local bacterial isolates and cloned in plant                  expression vectors under the control of specific promoters.                     Secondly, bacterial pesticidal genes will be introduced and                     expressed in Nicotiana tabaccum which will be used as a model                   plant system.  Finally, resultant transgenic plants will be                     examined for the level of expression of the pesticidal genes and                their insect resistance.  The findings of these studies will be a               basis for extending transgenic plant technology to other                        agriculturally important crops in Pakistan including rice, cotton               and chick peas.  It is proposed that isolation, cloning and                     introduction of pesticidal genes into plants will be done in                    Pakistan where Dr. Riazuddin's laboratory has the  required level               of experience and where the necessary infrastructure exists.                    However, the provision of expendable biologicals unavailable in                 Pakistan must be ensured.  Dr. Riazuddin or his associates will                 spend about three months in the U.S. to obtain specialized                      training in the use of various promoters and amino acid                         sequencing of purified pesticidal proteins.  Work with such                     sequencing methodologies is routine at Dr. Gordon's laboratory at               the University of Washington.                                                                                                                                   Scope: The use of engineered plants to protect crops from insect                attack has great potential not only in Pakistan but throughout                  the developing world for  achieving effective, low cost, and                    environmentally acceptable pest control. Unlike traditional                     strategies which use chemical insecticides, biological control                  avoids the induction of downstream burdens on the agricultural                  infra-structure.  The proposed research is part of a major                      program on transgenic plant technology currently being pursued at               laboratories of the Centre for Advanced Molecular Biology in                    Pakistan.  With moderate dollar support, there are many mutual                  benefits including provision of critical laboratory materials                   that are not available in Pakistan, training in sophisticated                   methodologies, the opportunity for U.S. scientists to engage in                 research, teaching, the exchange of information on a topic of                   common interest, and the promotion of the scientific relationship               between the institutions.  Locally, this project has strong                     backing from Punjab University and from Pakistan's agricultural                 planners.",
