The school is jointly organized by the                    U.S. Particle Accelerator School, office at Fermilab and the                    CERN Accelerator School, headquartered at CERN; Switzerland.                    The school will be hosted by the Southeastern Universities                      Research Association, Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator                      Facility.  The 4th International School in the series of                        \"Frontiers of Particle Beams,\" will be on the subject of \"Beam                  Intensity Limitations,\" a very important concept which has to                   be taken into account in the design of a given particle                         accelerator facility.  The school provides a source of current                  knowledge on particle accelerators and helps build up particle                  accelerator expertise as well as fosters international                          collaboration on accelerator education.  The school is intended                 for individuals with professional interests in accelerator                      physics and technology, for graduate students, for post                         doctoral research scientists and for those working in                           accelerator-based sciences.",
