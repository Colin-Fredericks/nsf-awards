 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key challenge in educating today's undergraduate students is                  to bring together understanding of biochemistry,                                immunochemistry, microbiology and molecular biology in a                        functional manner. The aim of this project is to develop a                      year-long laboratory course with 3 integrated modules for                       undergraduate majors in the Department of Biological Sciences'                  Bachelor of Science degree programs in Biochemistry and                         Microbiology which are now being expanded to include Molecular                  Biology. These laboratory modules are designed to provide up-                   to-date training for the students in fundamental methods used                   in biochemistry, immunochemistry, microbiology an molecular                     biology. This laboratory course sequence will complement the                    year-long lecture course in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,                 which is a set of 3 one-term modules required for students                      studying Biochemistry and Microbiology. The current situation                   is that only a single one-term laboratory course is offered and                 it covers only the basic methods used in biochemistry and a                     brief introduction to nucleic acids. The proposed project is a                  logical extension of our curriculum, which would bring together                 contemporary methodology using modern instrumentation to                        enhance the learning environment for these students. To achieve                 this program development, we will integrate our offerings in                    laboratory methods to link the student's understanding of                       biochemistry, immunochemistry and microbiology to molecular                     biology.  The major instruments to be purchased include: UV-Vis                 spectrophotometers, PhastSystem gel electrophoresis system,                     FPLC chromatography system (including an IBM-type personal                      computer), preparative centrifuge, bench-top fermenter, DNA                     sequencing gel apparatus and DNA sequence analysis software.                    The significance of this project lies in the unique integration                 around a central theme of biochemical and immunochemical                        methods for analysis of enzymes and recombinant gene products,                  the regulation of gene expression in bacteria, and the cloning                  and characterization of bacterial genes.",
