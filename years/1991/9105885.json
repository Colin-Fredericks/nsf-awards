 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the function of proteins requires knowledge of                    their structures, conformations, and internal motions.  While the               existence of motions in proteins on a broad time scale is                       generally acknowledged, computer simulations of those motions are               confined primarily to the subnanosecond regime.  Experimental                   quantification of both  the rates and amplitudes of molecular                   motions on this time scale is difficult, but necessary in order                 to give credence to implications of the simulations.  The overall               goals of this project are to validate and to further develop NMR                and fluorescence methods for measuring internal motions in                      peptides and proteins, to apply those methods to specially                      synthesized, isotopically labeled peptides and genetically                      engineered proteins, and to correlate the experimental results                  with computer simulations of the molecular dynamics.  NMR and                   fluorescence data will be acquired on the same residues in the                  same peptides and proteins to confirm the experimental values for               the motional parameters.  The peptides examined will include the                cytolytic peptide melittin, which is especially suited for this                 work because of the solvent-dependent nature of its conformation                and its propensity to interact with proteins and with lipids.                   The proteins to be investigated, RNAse-T1, thioredoxin, and                     barnase, are of low molecular weight and have known crystal                     and/or solution structures.",
