 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of North Carolina at Greensboro for the renovation and               repair of Eberhart Building which houses animal care facilities                 and the biological and behavioral sciences research and research                training activities utilizing these facilities.  This building was              constructed in 1971 and expanded by means of an addition in 1977.               The ARFMP grant of $285,000 and $286,200 provided by the grantee as             cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research              training facilities thus accommodating a carefully planned increase             in the research and research training activities taking place in                Eberhart and helping to achieve the important goal of                           centralization of such facilities among the members of the                      Consolidated University of North Carolina.  This project,                       addressing the need to improve the research infrastructure by                   providing better sanitation and security, will include upgrading of             heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), and modification              of the floor plan to add a rack washer, fume hoods, and new animal              housing rooms.                                                                                                                                                  This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of graduate and undergraduate students.  Students              trained in these laboratories, where high standards of animal care              are maintained, will bring to their research and clinical careers               an appreciation for procedures which meet national standards of                 practice and accreditation.",
