 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial core support for the continuing                 activities of the Board of Chemical Sciences and Technology                     (BCST) of the Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and                 Resources.  It is supported jointly by the Office of Special                    Projects in the Division of Chemistry and by the Division of                    Chemical and Thermal Systems in the Directorate for                             Engineering.  The BCST serves as the focal point within the                     National Research Council (NRC) for concerns and issues                         affecting chemistry in its broadest sense, including                            biochemistry and chemical engineering.  Board activities                        require extensive planning for ongoing studies, potential                       studies, private sector fund raising, and broadly directed                      efforts to communicate Board activities to the chemistry                        community.  All of these are core activities.  The capacity to                  develop a new project while paying costs partially or fully                     from core funds enhances the freedom and ability of the Board                   to react responsively to important issues in the field of                       chemistry and chemical technology.                                              %%%                                                                             Effective communication with the public, with other scientists                  and with scientific organizations representing chemical                         sciences and technology is important for maximizing the                         effectiveness of research in the chemical sciences and chemical                 engineering.  Partial support for the Board on Chemical                         Sciences and Technology ensures that the National Research                      Council will be able to take maximum advantage of the                           scientific talent available to it and be appropriately                          aggressive in undertaking new tasks of importance to the                        community.  This support is highly leveraged with support from                  other Federal agencies and the private sector.",
