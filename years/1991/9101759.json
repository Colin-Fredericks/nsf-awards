The program's awards provide opportunities for                     joint research, and the use of unique or complementary                          facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                       This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research                    visit by Dr. John Dolan with Fereidoun Rassoulzadegan,                          Director of Research at the Station Zoologique, Villefranche-                   sur-Mer, France.  The researchers will focus on the oligotrich                  ciliates which often dominate marine microzo\u001aplankton                           communities, about which recent work has shown a large                          fraction (. 1/3) are mixotrophic; that is, in addition to                       herbivory they use photosynthate produced by chloroplasts                       sequestered from ingested algae.  The researchers propose to                    use field work and laboratory work to ask what large-scale                      environmental properties influence the abundance of these                       forms and what cellular mechanisms may be involved in                           chloroplast enslavement.  Field work will examine the                           variability of mixotrophic oligotrichs in relation to                           changes in the abundance of autotrophic nanoplankton, light,                    and heterotrophic competitors.  Laboratory work will                            investigate cellular mechanisms.  The postulate that a                          chemical cue, derived from the algae source of chloroplasts,                    modifies the normal course of food vacuole processing is                        justified.  A set of experiments designed to locate the                         chemical cue and examine the effect of the state of the                         source algae as well as the state of the oligotrich is                          outlined.  The study will add significantly to knowledge of                     how some plankters survive in nutritionally dilute environ-                     ments and also will further understanding of the cellular                       mechanisms involved with symbiosis.                                                                                                                             The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a dependents' allowance.",
