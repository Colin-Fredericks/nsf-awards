 "awd_abstract_narration": "An intensive two-week laboratory workshop that allows 20 university             faculty to learn the basic principles, techniques and applications              of modern molecular biology is being offered during three summers.              The goal of the program is to provide participants with the                     experience and materials to implement an effective undergraduate                molecular biology laboratory program.  Because of rapid advances,               few educational institutions have been able to incorporate modern               molecular biology in their laboratory curricula.  This workshop                 will provide an important contribution to undergraduate education               by offering undergraduate teaching faculty hands on experience with             these techniques.  The course consists of laboratory exercises in               DNA purifications and separations, gene cloning, Southern blotting              and hybridization, DNA amplification and sequencing, and DNA                    sequence analysis.  Laboratories are be supplemented with lectures              on the principles of the methods used, and by seminars on the                   applications of molecular biology, presented by recognized experts.             Laboratory and lecture emphasis is on applications that are                     applicable to undergraduate teaching laboratories, and participants             receive the necessary experience and manuals to implement the                   exercises.  Sustained interactions among participants and with the              staff is encouraged during the workshop by frequent discussion                  sessions, and following the course by holding a follow-up session               11 months later.  Here participants will their experiences in                   developing and implementing exercises into new and existing                     curricula.",
