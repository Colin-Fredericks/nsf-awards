 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a group of approximately 25 U.S. and Caribbean          scientists, representing around 20 regional marine research institu-            tions, to participate in a workshop organized by Prof. John C. Ogden            of the University of South Florida and collaborators.  The workshop,            which is to take place at the Discovery Bay Marine Laboratory of the            University of the West Indies in Jamaica, will discuss and conduct              fields trials for a suite of standardized physical (temperature,                salinity, light attenuation, and suspended solids) and biological               (community structure and growth rate of principal species) measure-             ments.  This monitoring program will be implemented with UNESCO                 funding following the workshop as the core of the Caribbean Coastal             Marine Productivity (CARICOMP) program.                                                                                                                         The Workshop will be led by a staff of experts in Caribbean marine              ecosystems and will be guided by a draft Methods Manual produced with           UNESCO support since the CARICOMP program was started at a UNESCO/NSF           supported workshop in Jamaica in 1985.  A key element will be the               establishment of data management protocols consistent with proper               statistical procedures.  The CARICOMP program is directed at an                 understanding of long-term coastal ecosystem change through comparative         ecosystem studies at the geographic scale of the Caribbean and                  adjacent waters.  The requested support will allow the implementation           of the program at a time of increasing conviction that we are                   entering an unprecedented era of marine ecosystem change caused by              human impact and global climate change.",
