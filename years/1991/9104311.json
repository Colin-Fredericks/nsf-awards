 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues in the Program in                      Computational and Applied Mathematics in the Mathematics                        Department at UCLA undertake expanded educational and research                  programs for graduate students.  Fellowships and an outreach                    program will be created to recruit and support graduate students.               A particular effort to attract and support female graduate                      students is a central point of the project.  The training of the                graduate students will be enhanced through a program of                         scientific visitors, in which established faculty from outside                  the university will be invited to give introductory seminars and                short courses on topics of current research interest.  To foster                interactions of the students with each other, as well as with                   faculty, visiting scientists, and postdoctoral scholars, they                   will hold a scientific retreat and workshop once a year.                             Current U.S. scientific and technological efforts have                     created a national need for teachers and researchers in                         scientific computing and applied mathematics.  This project                     attempts to address that need in a systematic way, building on                  particular local advantages but exploring methods that could be                 successful elsewhere.",
