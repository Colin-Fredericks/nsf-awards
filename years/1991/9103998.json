 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the management of congestion based on             flow control.  It will include a theoretical study of the paradigm              for solving networks with multiple virtual circuit window flow                  control and will validate the paradigm by simulation, including but             limited to Markovian traffic.  Particular attention will be given               to establishing the validity of the model which is based on the                 Markovian assumption and other, more realistic traffic models.  The             research will also include the theoretical study of the application             of open queueing networks for modeling input rate regulation as a               means of flow control.  Another research topic includes the                     examination and evaluation of fast algorithms for real-time                     optimization with respect to several network measures including                 network power, and throughput with queueing time constraints and                fairness.                                                                            The researchers will investigate, either by analytical means               or by simulation, several input rate control schemes including                  average rate control, leaky bucket and promising variations and                 compare them to window control.  They will study the opportunities              for using these methods and others described above to influence re-             routing and fault recovery.",
