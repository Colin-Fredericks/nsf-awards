 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with several aspects of the                      representation theory of semisimple algebraic groups over fields                of prime characteristic, with applications to finite groups of                  Lie type.  Recent ideas of Lusztig relating quantum groups and                  modular representations will be explored, with emphasis on                      injective modules.  Representations arising from the cohomology                 of line bundles on flag varieties will be another central issue;                a major question here concerns the relationship with                            Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for the affine Weyl group.  The study               of algebraic groups should provide further insight into                         representations of associated finite simple groups; here a number               of open questions and conjectures about injective modules and                   decomposition behavior mod p of ordinary characters will be                     studied.                                                                             This research is in the general area of algebraic groups.                  The proposed research falls under two broad headings: cohomology                of line bundles on flag varieties, and injective modules.                       Advances along these lines would both shed light on Lusztig's                   conjecture, as well as point the way beyond it.",
