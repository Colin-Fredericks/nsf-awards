 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new Laboratory is being created to enable the Computer                        Science Department to offer its majors experience in the design                 and implementation of parallel computing systems.  The students                 work with three types of parallel systems: extensively                          pipelined uniprocessors with multiple execution units,                          multiprocessors using shared memory, and message passing                        multiprocessor systems.  The new course completes a sequence of                 three courses; the other two courses are a lecture course in                    computer architecture, and a laboratory course in microcomputer                 systems design.  In the new laboratory each group of two                        students works with an Intel 386 based IBM AT clone equipped                    with a CSA Transputer board, a Microway i860 board, and a logic                 analyzer board.  The ATs are networked to a laboratory file and                 print server, and furnish I/0 facilities to the installed                       boards.  The Intel i860 provides the vehicle for investigating                  parallel uniprocessors.  The Transputer board introduces                        students to message passing multiprocessor systems.  A 16 node                  reconfigurable Transputer system, hosted by a separate AT,                      permits the students to implement on a real multiprocessor the                  software that they have developed, and enables them to                          investigate the link operation and link driver/receiver design.                 Microway's 860 boards are each equipped with two links which                    will enable the student to develop an asymmetric                                multiprocessing system with the Transputer.  Shared memory                      multiprocessors are made up of existing multiple Intel 8086                     boards housed in a Multibus equipped card cage.",
