 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aminotransferases (also called transaminases) are a class of                    pyridoxal-phosphate-depending enzymes that are known to be at                   the core of amino acid metabolism in all organisms.  Because                    of their central metabolic position, they have been                             demonstrated to be involved in a number of diseases that are                    characterized by inborn errors of metabolism.  The best                         studied of all of this class of enzymes is the aspartate                        aminotransferase, which equilibrates aspartic acid and                          glutamic acid through the corresponding a-keto-acids,                           ketoglutarate and oxalaoceate.  The enzyme is a dimer of two                    identical subunits, each of overall molecular weight about                      40,000.  The crystal structure of E.coli enzyme shows that                      each subunit consists of two domains, and that the active                       site lies at the domain and subunit interfaces.  There is a                     large conformational change, involving the movement of over                     100 amino acids in the smaller of the two domains, when                         substrate binds.  Another less well-characterized                               transaminase is the bacterial D-amino acid transaminase,                        which does not handle L-amino acids at all but does have s                      wide specificity for the D-counterparts.  Both are                              crystalline, and both bind substrates in the crystalline                        state.  A third transaminase which will be studied is the                       alanine specific one from beef heart.  The goal of this                         project is to understand the specificity and catalytic                          mechanism(s) of these transaminases in terms of their                           structures.  Structural comparison of the aspartate and                         alanine specific transaminases will give insight into the                       side-chain specificities of these enzymes.  Comparison of the                   L-and D-specific transaminases will give insight into the                       chiral specificities of these enzymes.  Mutants of the                          bacterial enzymes and structures of complexes with substrates                   and inhibitors will  giveinsight as to the roles of specific                    amino acids at the active sites and the structural basis for                    changes in catalysis (mechanism).  The causes of the                            substrate-dependent conformational change in the aspartate                      enzyme (and possibly in others) will be probed in detail                        through the combined use of crystallography and site-specific                   mutagenesis.",
