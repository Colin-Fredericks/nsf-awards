 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a two year research project                     between Professor Edmund Clarke, School of Computer Science,                    Carnegie Mellon University, and Professor Hiromi Hiraishi,                      Department of Information Science, Kyoto University, Japan.                     The aim of the project is to investigate formal verification                    methods for finite state systems.  These systems arise                          naturally in the design of computer software and communication                  protocols, and their correctness is likely to become an                         important issue in the future.  Recent work has shown that                      finite systems can often be verified automatically by                           constructing and analyzing state-graph models of system                         behavior.  However these methods rely on decision algorithms                    which explicitly construct the state-graph model and because                    the number of states in a model may grow exponentially with                     the number of concurrently executing components, the complexity                 of systems that can be verified has been limited.  This                         research will focus on new techniques which avoid this                          problem, so that formal verification can be applied to                          systems of realistic complexity.  A number of alternative                       techniques have been proposed.  One example is to exploit the                   hierarchical structure of the circuit in the verification                       process.  Each individual component may be verified separately                  and the results combined to infer properties of the global                      behavior of the system.  A second approach is to implement                      parallel algorithms that will run on supercomputers.                                                                                                            Both the US and Japanese researchers involved in this project                   have been developing techniques for detecting these design                      errors and recent research by both provides strong evidence                     that it is possible to develop practical tools for this                         purpose.  The research skills of the two researchers are                        complementary and each country has much to learn from the                       other about ways of dealing with this problem.  If successful                   this project should lead to new techniques for automatic                        design verification of finite state systems.",
