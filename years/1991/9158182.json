 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolutionary history of double fertilization and endosperm,                 two of the most important reproductive features associated with                 the origin and success of flowering plants will be examined. The                developmental fate of the second fertilization in the genus                     Ephedra, a non-flowering seed plant and a basal member of the                   most closely related extant group of plants (Gnetales) to the                   angiosperms, will be studied. The ultimate goal of this work is                 to determine whether the second fertilization product in Ephedra                exhibits endosperm-like qualities that would support a new                      hypothesis for a pre-flowering plant origin of endosperm.                       Evidential support for this hypothesis would fundamentally alter                our current concepts of the evolutionary history and origins of                 flowering plants.                                                                                                                                               A second set of studies will examine mate choice in non-                        flowering seed plants. Although more than fifty percent of                      flowering plant species exhibit some type of genetic                            incompatibility mechanism that prevents the fertilization of                    ovules by pollen from closely related individuals, evidence for                 similar incompatibility systems among non-flowering seed plants,                is rare. Initial studies using Douglas fir have, for the first                  time, documented pre-zygotic response to pollen quality outside                 of flowering plants. Planned studies will examine the competitive               effects of mixed genetic loads of pollen (and female response to                the genetic constitution of pollen) in loblolly pine, a major                   forestry crop in the southeastern US.",
