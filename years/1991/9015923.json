 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a four month visit by Professor                         Victor Kac of MIT to Pisa, Italy to carry out research with                     Professor Corrado DeConcini of the Scuola Normale in Pisa.                      The two mathmeticians intend to work on quantum groups at                       roots of unity and on quasiperiodic solutions of exceptional                    hierarchies of soliton equations.                                                                                                                               There has been a great deal of work recently on quantum                         groups Uq(g), where g is a finite-dimensional simple Lie                        algebra, for generic q.  For q = root of 1 the properties of                    Uq(g) are dramatically different.  The structure of the                         center of Uq(g) for this case is of particular interest to                      the researchers.  In the area of quasiperiodic solutions of                     soliton equations, thanks to the Krichever constructions                        Riemann theta functions are seen as solutions of the Kadomtsev-                 Petviashvili (KP) equations.  This result has been extended                     to show that Prym theta functions are also solutions of KP                      equations of type B.  The proposed joint work will attempt to                   show that some further generalizations, for example the Prym-                   Tjurin theta functions, will also turn out to be solutions to                   other exceptional hierarchies of soliton equations.",
