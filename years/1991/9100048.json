 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Narayan S. Hosmane of the Chemistry Department, Southern                    Methodist University, is being supported by the Inorganic,                      Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program to synthesize extended                 cage carborane species and characterize their electrochemical,                  structural, and spectral properties.  These novel compounds                     will contain main group and early transition metal elements                     \"sandwiched\" between carborane cages which are linked to form                   chains.  To accomplish the synthesis, Hosmane will take                         advantage of the stabilization afforded carborane cages by                      attachment of the C-trimethylsilyl group.  Stable carborane                     carbanions are to be generated by stepwise removal of these                     silyl groups.  In addition, metallocarborane cages linked by                    pyrimidine will be synthesized.                                                 %%%                                                                             The compounds to be prepared are unusual in terms of bonding,                   structure, and reactivity.  As a result, production of stable                   species with interesting electronic properties is a possible                    outcome.  More importantly, fundamental information will be                     obtained on the electrochemical properties of a class of                        compounds which has not been studied previously.  Also,                         designed synthesis of extended arrays and development of a                      means of activating carborane cages are important developments                  in borane and carborane chemistry and have implications for                     transition metalloborane and metallocarborane cluster chemistry.",
