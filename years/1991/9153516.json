 "awd_abstract_narration": "Minorities are significantly underrepresented in science and                    engineering fields in the United States.  To attract and retain                 capable minority students requires the development of programs                  which motivate and encourage them toward science and                            engineering.  This project is designed to involve students in                   hands-on research activities in the NAPI (Navajo Agricultural                   Product Industry) under the guidance of professionals.                                                                                                          The project has the following distinctive objectives:                                                                                                                Increasing the understanding and effectiveness of                               problem-solving, information processing and                                     decision-making analysis related to water, land,                                human resources and environmental protection for                                irrigated agricultural systems.                                                                                                                                 Training and encouraging Native American, Hispanic                              and other minority students, as well as women, to                               complete graduate work and pursue engineering and                               agricultural economic careers in the development and                            application of technology to improve resource                                   management.                                                                                                                                                     Implementing a teamwork learning environment that                               includes undergraduate students, graduate students,                             faculty, and an outside corporation (NAPI).
