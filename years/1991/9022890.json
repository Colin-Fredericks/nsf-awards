 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an investigation into the circulation of the                    deep basins of the Arctic Ocean using chemical tracers                          supported by closely spaced hydrographic sections.  Oceanic                     tracers are extremely useful in assessing how the large-                        scale circulation maintains the hydrographic structure and                      the arctic sea ice cover, and in estimating the exchange of                     water between the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas.  This                     project will collect, measure, and evaluate the tritium,                        helium isotopes, oxygen-18, and carbon-14 concentration in                      sea water on transects in the European Basin as part of the                     International Arctic Ocean Expedition 1991, a three-ship                        expedition.  Small volume sampling will be carried out on                       the Swedish icebreaker ODEN, while large-volume sampling                        will be done from the German research ship POLARSTERN.  The                     proposed combination of tracers will allow the establishing                     of renewal time scales for both deep and shallow water                          masses.  Additionally, the pattern of tracers in deep basins                    will give indications of the origin of these deep water                         masses and the processes by which they were formed.",
