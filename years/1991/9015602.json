 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most organic matter synthesized in surface waters of the sea is                 returned to inorganic constituents within the upper 500 m, or                   \"regeneration zone.\"  Oceanographers attribute these chemical                   transformations mostly to living organisms.  Yet surprisingly                   little is known about the biology of remineralization below the                 euphotic zone: whether the responsible organisms are dominantly                 metazoan or microbial and whether or not they occur on the larger               particles that deliver material to depth. Dr. Pilskaln, together                with Dr. Silver will conduct a 2-year study in Monterey Bay, and                accessible, comparatively deep water site, to study the role of                 both microbes and zooplankton in the remineralization of                        particles >1mm.  Using a combination of in situ observations and                laboratory measurements, she will study both the abundant marine                snow particles and very large aggregates (m size) that can serve                as model systems for such studies. She plans to (1) measure the                 size and abundance of the aggregates, (2) determine their                       chemical properties and associated living communities, (3)                      measure regeneration-related activities of the communities on the               particles, and (4) compare and particle-related remineralization                rates to those measured by sediment traps in the area.  For these               measurements, she will use field surveys with a Romotely Operated               Vehicle (ROV) and a Marine Snow Camera, a variety of sampling                   devices operated from the ROV, and a series of experiments on                   natural samples incubated on shipboard and in the laboratory.  In               year 2, Dr. Pilskaln transects the California Current to learn                  whether the very large aggregates, which are hypothesized to be                 regeneration centers to Monterey Bay, occur in significant                      numbers further offshore.  These results will increase the                      understanding of the biology of midwater remineralization and the               role that particles can play in the process.",
