Having learned broadly of new                    analytical science and technology from the classroom work, and                  having done forefront research in the various research groups                   at North Carolina, the undergraduate faculty will return to                     their home institutions, to foster undergraduate research there.                                                                                                %%%                                                                                                                                                             This program is one of three group Research Opportunity Award                   grants supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                        Program in the Chemistry Division.  It is unique in its                         combination of classroom lectures with research participation.                  Combined classroom and research work seeks to broaden the                       general understanding of teachers from small 4-year                             institutions, as well as to catalyze their increased                            involvement in research.",
