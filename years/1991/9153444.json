 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT), in collaboration with                  the Boston Housing Authority (BHA-Public Safety Division),                      Federated Dorchester Neighborhood Association, and the eastern                  zone Boston pubic elementary schools is developing a model                      program, the Summer/Winter Camp in Applied Technology.  The                     purpose of the program is to stimulate the curiosity and                        interest of elementary school age (grade 3 and 4) minority                      students in mathematics, science and technology.  Studies have                  shown that the time to influence young people's career choices                  is in elementary school.  WIT is conducting a program that                      demonstrates the practical application of mathematics and                       science by clarifying the part these subjects play in preparing                 for careers in applied technology.   The camp curriculum                        encourages hand-on participation through laboratory projects                    in manufacturing technology, computer science, mechanical                       engineering and civil engineering/building construction.  The                   underlying theme of the camp curriculum is how things break,                    how things work, how things are built , and how people solve                    problems.  The curriculum is based on the mathematics and                       science objectives of the targeted school district.  The                        technical components of the camp are balanced by a sports                       program that enables students to learn about the importance of                  good health, positive release of stress and team efforts.  The                  pilot for this program was held during July 1991, and was                       funded by the Massachusetts Board of Regents under the                          Eisenhower Program as well as the Alfred P. Sloane Foundation                   and local Boston industry.//",
