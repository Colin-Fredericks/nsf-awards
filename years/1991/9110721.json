 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on research in disjunctive logic programming.              There are two main themes:  extend the procedural semantics of                  disjunctive logic programming to make it a viable programming                   language, and build a programming environment similar to PROLOG based           on the above semantics.  The work uses the procedural semantics of              disjunctive logic programs using SLO-resolution.  It is planned to              extend the definition of SLO-resolution to answer positive and                  negative queries from normal disjunctive logic programs and to                  provide indefinite answer substitutions for variables in a query.  It           is planned to study the properties of disjunctive logic programs and            identify classes of programs for which ancestry-resolution checking             can be restricted without compromising completeness.  The study will            increase the efficiency of executing disjunctive logic programs.  The           intent is to augment SLO-resolution with these techniques.  It is               intended to build upon the theoretical studies and implement a                  programming system, called DISLOG, using SLO-resolution.  DISLOG will           be an extension of PROLOG, inheriting its stack-based environment,              control structure and backtracking feature.  The significance of the            research will be to extend the use of logic as a programming language           to a larger subset of predicate calculus.  Due to its capability to             solve problems with multiple extensions and indefinite information,             DISLOG will provide an enhanced representation and reasoning                    environment for solving problems in artificial intelligence.",
