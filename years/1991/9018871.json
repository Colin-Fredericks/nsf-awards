The plan to drill and core to 10 km depth by the KTB                project of West Germany represents the first opportunity to                     measure in situ stress magnitudes at seismogenic depth in                       continental crust.                                                                   Conventional stress measurement techniques cannot be                       employed in the KTB main borehole, or most other deep boreholes.                Thus, this project is aimed at development of a novel integrated                stress measurement strategy for eventual use to 10 km depth in                  the KTB borehole and other deep holes, such as those that exist                 in the Soviet Union.  There are four main  activities associated                with developing and implementing the proposed stress measurement                strategy:  Making detailed observations of breakouts and thermal                fractures in the borehole, development of sufficiently                          comprehensive theories of borehole failure, conducting                          comprehensive laboratory tests on core and making least principal               stress measurements utilizing hydraulic fractures through                       perforations in the casing.  This research is being done in                     collaboration with Prof. Karl Fuchs of the University of                        Karlsruhe and Prof. Fritz Rummel of  Ruhr University-Bochum.                    Laboratory strength measurements of core samples will be done in                collaboration with Dr. James Byerlee of the U.S. Geological                     Survey.",
