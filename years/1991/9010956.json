 "awd_abstract_narration": "An understanding of voting in sub-presidential elections is essential           to a full understanding of voting behavior in the United States.  This          derives most obviously from the fact that most voting is performed at           the state and local level, choosing government officials responsible            for allocating and administering public resources on a vast scale.              Despite the importance of these voting decisions, attention to them has         been overshadowed by attention to the presidential contest, and to a            lesser extent, to congressional elections.  In addition to substantive          findings, a contribution of this study is the development of a                  framework for analyzing voting behavior in sub-presidential elections.                                                                                          Important to the study of sub-presidential contests is the variation in         the visibility of the several races and the fact that low visibility is         a condition common to many state and local elections.  An understanding         of voting in such elections has not been provided by the much more              extensive research on the highly visible presidential elections.  Yet           such races are the norm in American politics rather than the exception.                                                                                         The site of this investigation is the 1990 general election in Ohio             which features a highly visible governor's race, moderately visible             contests for four state executive offices, and two potentially low              visibility nonpartisan races for seats on the Ohio Supreme Court.  The          variation in visibility is important to an understanding of the                 differences in the sources and kinds of information that are used by            voters as information becomes less obtainable.  Informational                   differences are expected to be critical to the understanding of the             bases for preferences between candidates.                                                                                                                       Different models of voting behavior will be tested, including party             line, split-ticket, incumbency preference, and coattail voting                  patterns.  The sources and levels of information brought to bear on the         voting decisions, and how they change as a function of the campaign,            will be examined in relation to variation in the visibility of the              different contests.                                                                                                                                             Interviews of 1,200 Ohio citizens will be conducted shortly after Labor         Day, respondents will be re-interviewed immediately prior to the                election, and all pre-election respondents will be re-interviewed               immediately after the election.  Respondents will be asked a series of          questions regarding evaluations of, attitudes toward, and preferences           for the competing candidates.  Knowledge of the candidates will be              critical information as will the sources of this knowledge, such as             mass media and the activities of parties and candidates in                      communicating with and enlisting the support of voters.  A full battery         of socio-demographic questions will be asked of each respondent in              addition to questions on prior voting behavior, political affiliations          and policy-related attitudes.",
