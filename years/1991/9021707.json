 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Porter is studying the social and political role of                         quantification.  He argues that the \"objectivity\" of quantitative               arguments is not simply a matter of appearing true, but also of                 being highly standardized, or governed by explicit rules.                       Quantitative reasoning is valued in the political realm in part                 because it seems to be independent of the biases and interests of               individuals, and hence to be quintessentially \"public\" knowledge.               Dr. Porter is examining from this standpoint the history of some                of the most widely-used modern methods for reducing decisions to                calculations.  His research emphasizes the uses of cost-benefit                 analysis and, if time is available, statistical methods for                     detecting weak causes (such as carcinogenicity in chemicals).                   This is the first serious historical study of either of these                   methods, and indeed the first systematic attempt to understand                  historically the vastly-increased importance of quantification in               public life.  His standpoint throughout is that of the history of               science, and he compares these public uses of calculation with                  quantitative norms for reporting experimental results, such as                  the significance test.",
