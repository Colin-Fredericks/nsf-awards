 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent national studies have identified serious deficiencies               in mechanical tolerancing and metrology standards and practices,                and in the teaching of these in universities, training institutes,              and industry.  The central problem underlying all of these                      deficiencies is the lack of proper scientific foundations for                   mechanical tolerancing.  In essence, tolerancing and metrology                  evolved from shop-floor practice, and are taught and applied as                 collections of special-case techniques.                                              This project pursues four related lines of research to improve             this situation:  (1) development of a semi-formal mathematical                  codification for the main principles of the ANSI Y14.5 tolerancing              standard, initially in the form of a monograph and/or course notes              for engineering students; (2) extension of the codification with                mathematical and computational techniques for analyzing the                     accumulation of geometric tolerances (i.e., generalization of one-              dimension tolerance stacking).  Such techniques are important in                design for assembly;  (3) linking of the codification to metrology              practices, with selective research on open issues in dimensional                and surface modeling; and (4) exploratory research in functional                tolerancing (i.e., control of the effects of spatial variability                on the performance of designed artifacts).",
