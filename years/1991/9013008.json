 "awd_abstract_narration": "A continuing problem in the demographics of the U.S. astronomical               community is the scarcity of high-quality young solar physicists.               The average age of solar astronomers is among the highest of any                astronomical discipline, and this problem is aggravated by the                  dearth of U.S. academic institutions that actively support solar                research.  The Principal Investigator (PI) seeks to alleviate this              problem through a two-week, NATO Advanced Study Institute summer                course in Scotland.  This course would bring together experts in                various subdisciplines of solar physics to teach graduate students              the important advances in techniques in concepts in their fields.               Detailed notes from the course would be written by the astronomers,             and would be made available to the students and other interested                parties.  Some 80% of the expenses for this course will be paid by              the NATO ASI.  However, owing to certain restrictions on the                    international distribution of students in ASI courses, the PI is                requesting additional support for travel from the NSF.  It is hoped             that this summer course will alleviate the scarcity of young solar              astronomers in the U.S. and will help highlight the demographic                 problem in this discipline that has existed for at least two                    decades.",
