 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of the distribution and potential availability of                   mineral resources in the ground is fundamental to many                          political and investment decisions that will be made, placing                   economic geology at the interface between science and society.                  This study propose to examine the effects of recent political                   changes on the economic importance of non-fuel mineral                          resources in the affairs of both developed and developing                       countries.  Mineral endowment trends in substitution and                        recycling, and policy strategies are preeminent concerns.                       Procedure will entail consultation with international scholars                  in political science, mineral economics, history, and geology,                  in addition to archival research.                                                 Results of this study should provide guidance both for                        resource policy decisions and for ore deposit research.  The                    project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigators'                        enhanced visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In                    this effort, the proposed activities which contribute to the                    second objective include:  developing and teaching a course on                  minerals and world affairs; presenting a seminar on science and                 policy, giving lectures on a scientist's role in government;                    and serving as a counselor and mentor to students.",
