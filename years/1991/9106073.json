 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cretaceous has long been considered a time of equable                  climate while the cenozoic is regarded as a time of ice ages.                   Recent work suggests that the concept of an ice free Cretaceous may             need to be re-examined.  The best place to look for the extremes                of Cretaceous climate is within a high latitude terrestrial                     sedimentary basin.  Such rocks exist within the Otway and                       Strzelecki groups, southeastern Australia, which were deposited at              high latitude (>70 degrees S) during the lower Cretaceous.  Stable              isotopic measurements provide a vehicle for inferring the surface               temperature.  Previous work on the carbonate concretions recovered              from terrestrial sandstones revealed extremely  O-depleted values               for calcite, and these data indicate precipitation from low  O                  meteoric fluids and annual temperatures on the order of 0 degrees               C.  In addition, isotopic profiling of individual concretions and               cemented beds indicates that secular changes  in the    O values                of calcite cements can be correlated on three different scales:                 within an individual concretion, within a relative age sequence in              a composite concretion, or over meter scales in a vertical section              by comparing the isotopic compositions of concretion cores.  This               type of detailed isotopic work in conjunction with textural studies             indicate that it is possible to differentiate in these rocks the                near surface primary meteoric water signature from complications                arising from subsequent diagenetic events.  Interpreted in terms                of temperature change, the maximum   O change would correspond to               about a 5 degree C change in mean annual surface temperature.  In               this study, we propose to further constrain the carbonate oxygen                isotope data with   O/  O data on phosphate from fossil bones, and              with D/H and  O/  O data from paleosols.  Because of the high                   paleolatitude of this site and because of its terrestrial                       character, any Cretaceous global climatic changes should be                     amplified and easily detected in sequential samples in                          stratigraphic sections.  The changes already detected in limited                stratigraphic sampling suggest that it may be possible to recognize             Milankovitch climatic forcing in the isotopic record of the                     Cretaceous, southeastern Australia.",
