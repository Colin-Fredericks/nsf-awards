 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is an empirical investigation of female labor supply.             The first part focuses upon how experience on the job affects                   future wages and labor supply decisions; the second part looks at               joint labor supply decisions taken by married couples.  The                     estimation is complicated by the fact that labor market conditions              change with the business cycle, fluctuations that affect the                    decisions of individuals and households, which in turn feed forward             into future wage and employment rates.  Since previous research has             largely ignored this dynamic phenomenon, an important component of              the research is to develop econometric techniques from the                      underlying economic framework which can implement with the proposed             empirical strategy.  This research is important because it will                 provide a deeper understanding of factors that affect the                       participation and success of women in the labor market.",
