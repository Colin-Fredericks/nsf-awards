 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Drs. David Grove, Susan               Gillespie and their colleagues will conduct archaeological                      research at the Olmec site of La Isla which is located in                       Veracruz, Mexico.  The name \"La Isla\" or \"island\" reflects the                  fact that two streams bound the site which, unfortunately, is                   being destroyed through lateral erosion by each stream bed.                     Material abundant on both the surface as well as stream walls                   supports the attribution of this small site to the Olmec.  The                  investigators plan to conduct an intensive surface survey to                    locate and plot object densities and distributions.  This should                provide clues to the nature of individual activity areas and on                 this basis, limited excavations will be conducted.  With the                    stream wall materials to guide them, the team will also conduct                 horizontal excavations.  In addition to cultural materials such                 as pottery, both plant and animal remains will constitute an                    important focus of the research since the investigators wish to                 reconstruct subsistence practices.                                                                                                                              The Olmec society developed and flourished in the tropical                      lowlands of Mexico's southern Gulf coast between 1200 and 500 BC.               Large Olmec sites contain Middle America's first large public                   architecture and massive stone monuments.  Olmec has been termed                the \"America's first civilization.\"  Surprisingly, however,                     relatively little is known about them and is limited to old data                from two large sites.  Very little is known about either Olmec                  social organization or subsistence.  Archaeologists have learned                that to answer such questions it is best to examine smaller sites               where people lived rather than concentrate on large ceremonial                  centers which served as focus for ritual events.  This research                 by Drs. Grove and Gillespie is the first to be conducted in such                a situation.                                                                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed                   light on the factors which gave rise to the Olmec civilization.                 It will also provide data of interest to a large group of                       archaeologists.",
