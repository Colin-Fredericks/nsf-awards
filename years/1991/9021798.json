 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Luther              College for the renovation, repair, and partial replacement of                  Valders Hall which houses that institution's biology and chemistry              research and research training activities.  This building was                   constructed in 1961 and last renovated in 1987.  The ARFMP grant of             $125,000 and $148,078 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will              be used to modernize these research and research training                       facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                  current research infrastructure in terms of health and safety as                well as of the quality and quantity of research that can be                     conducted by replacing the ornamental greenhouse with a climate-                controlled prefabricated research greenhouse; converting existing               greenhouse space into research cubicles for student research                    projects; and modernizing rooms so as to accommodate computer                   networking and to house the impressive collection of research-                  caliber chemistry instruments that have been acquired in recent                 years and are presently scattered in five locations.                                                                                                            This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate students in an                        institution that has a strong track record of training students                 for science careers.",
