 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wu plans to continue his study on Dehn surgery and 3-                      manifold theory.  The principal task is to search for some                      satisfactory understanding of those \"exceptional\" Dehn surgeries                which yield reducible or boundary reducible 3-manifolds.  For the               boundary reducibility problems, he will concentrate on the 1-                   bridge conjecture for surgeries on knots in handlebodies.  For                  the reducibility problems, he will start by searching for more                  examples of exceptional Dehn surgeries, as this will hopefully                  lead to some intrinsic (probably even a complete) understanding                 of the reducibility of surgered manifolds.  Also, he will study                 the cabling conjecture for surgeries on knots in 3-manifolds                    which contain a non-separating reducing sphere.                                      Three-dimensional manifolds are very basic objects of                      geometric interest.  They are spaces which have the local                       character of Euclidean 3-space but may be globally much more                    complicated.  Examples in two-dimensions are easier to picture --               many surfaces are not the plane but would appear to be to ants                  crawling on them.  Since we live in a 3-dimensional manifold,                   ignoring the time dimension, they are of cosmological interest as               well, and there is a surprising amount not known about them.",
