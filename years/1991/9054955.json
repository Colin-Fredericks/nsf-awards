 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is enabling the Departments of Geological Sciences                 and Astronomy to develop a series of new freshmen/sophomore                     seminars for all liberal-arts undergraduates at the University                  of Michigan.  The goals of these seminars are to enhance the                    science instruction of potential science majors as well as non-                 science majors.  These seminars are limited in enrollment to                    twenty students, are taught by senior faculty,  have teaching                   assistants to provide extensive outside-class help to students,                 and require an oral presentation as well as a written paper on                  selected topics.  Seminars are in-depth treatments of                           scientific issues (in astronomy, geology, paleontology or                       oceanography) which are of importance to students' lives; the                   courses are not meant to he comprehensive introductory                          offerings.  Ample time for in-class question/answer periods and                 discussions enhance student participation and critical                          thinking; at the same time, the classes with their small size                   provide better opportunity for student-faculty contact than our                 present large lecture offerings.  Some of these seminars have                   hands-on laboratory or computing components, others are planned                 with short field trips.  The teaching assistants associated                     with these seminars help lead discussions and give occasional                   lectures under close supervision of the faculty; this allows us                 to train these TA's in classroom methods.  It is hoped that an                  increase in the numbers of undergraduate concentrators in                       science fields will be an eventual result of these seminars.",
