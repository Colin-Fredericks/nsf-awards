 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over time in a location, common species tend to  remain                    common while rare species remain rare.  Biologists have long been               interested in determining what factors or processes regulate or                 control population size.  Recently, the effect of human                         activities in decreasing the abundance of some species has                      become more apparent.  With increasing interest in protecting                   biological diversity has come an attempt to identify the factors                affecting the survival of rare and endangered species.                               This research investigates the effects of population size on               the performance of individual plants within those populations.                  Two species of thistle occurring in the mountains of New Mexico                 will be studied:  one a rare species (protected as a federally                  Threatened species) and the other a more common thistle of                      similar environments.  Populations of different sizes (ranging                  from 10 to over 3000 individuals) will be selected from known                   populations of the rare species;  individual plants within these                populations will be monitored. Similar observation will be                      carried out on artificial populations of the common species,                    which will be established with plants transplanted by the                       investigator.  Estimates of the rates of survival, seed                         production, and so on in these populations will be used in                      computer models to assess the viability (the chances for                        continued persistence) of extremely small populations of the                    threatened species.                                                                  This research will shed light on the processes that regulate               population size in plants, both common and rare.  The research                  will also test methods for assessing the viability of small                     populations.  Such techniques are essential for land managers and               government agencies making decisions about which species or                     populations are worthy candidates for conservation efforts.",
