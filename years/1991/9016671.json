 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Geldzahler at Applied Research Corporation and his collaborator             Dr. Fomalont at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory will carry             out a concentrated study of the enigmatic galactic source Sco X-1.              They will use radio telescopes in the U.S. and Europe to address                questions of the relative motions of components of the source, the              distance of the source, the implications for a dual-beam model of               energy transport, flux density variations of the extended                       components, the emission mechanism of the source, and confinement               of the lobes.                                                                                                                                                   The X-ray binary star system Sco X-1 is the only known Galactic                 object to exhibit a radio morphology similar to the classical                   extragalactic double radio sources.  It is also the only known                  double-lobed radio source with a neutron star as its energy source.             It has been suggested that the process of forming the lobes in Sco              X-1 is similar to that in the luminous extragalactic objects.                   Investigation of Sco X-1 can impact a number of fields of                       astrophysics and plasma physics.  Understanding dual-beam                       extragalactic sources is important to cosmology, to active galactic             nuclei, and to jets.  Space and laboratory plasma physicists are                interested in the mechanics of jet acceleration, stability of the               beams during energy and momentum transport, and the interaction of              the beams with targets.  Dr. Geldzahler and his collaborators have              designed observations to more clearly reveal the character of Sco               X-1 and thus better understand the linkage between this source and              extragalactic core-jet-lobe sources and to better understand the                plasma physics of this phenomenon.",
