Computer                              demonstrations and assignments are being made an integral part                  of course syllabi for designated mathematics and biology                        courses and are being used to a lesser extent in chemistry and                  physics classes.  Acquisition of computer equipment and the                     incorporation of computer technology into science and                           mathematics courses is enabling students to better appreciate                   and understand difficult science and mathematics topics                         encountered at Maysville Community College.  The incorporation                  of computer technology into all science disciplines is                          producing students who are prepared to use up-to-date                           technology at their transfer institutions.NSF grant funds are                   being matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
