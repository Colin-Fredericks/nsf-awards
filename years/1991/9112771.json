 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are three parts in this project.  The first part deals with               learning processes in common value (mineral rights) auctions.                   Inexperienced bidders in these auctions suffer from the winner's                curse, earning negative profits and bidding above the expected                  value conditional on winning the item.  Experience bidders adjust               to the adverse selection forces, eventually earning positive                    profits.  The question is exactly what it is that subjects are                  learning.  Are they simply learning to bid less for any given                   environment, a reaction to losing money as a consequence of                     winning, or learning to understand the adverse selection forces,                which would indicate some ability to generalize across                          environments.  The research has practical implications for                      understanding bidding behavior in mineral rights auctions and                   coincides with recent theoretical interest in learning processes                in economics as well.                                                                                                                                           The second part studies private value double auctions.  Recent                  developments in theoretical analyses of double auction mechanisms               have concentrated on single shot auctions in which traders'                     valuations are drawn randomly from distributions whose structure                is common knowledge, and in which traders have inelastic demands                or supplies for a single unit of consumption at a reservation                   price that is privately known.  The motivation for detailed game                theoretical studies of particular trading rules is to elaborate                 precisely how trading rules and each trader's strategic behavior                using his private information combine to determine terms of trade               that reflect substantially all the disbursed information.  In                   this project, the experimental investigation of these trading                   rules is designed to determine the behavioral robustness of these               predictions.  These studies are important since double auctions                 are a fundamental trading environment for market economies.                                                                                                     The last part deals with experimental and field studies of                      auctions with incentive contracts.  Incentive contracts make the                payment depend both on the bid and the realized cost.  If                       realized cost exceeds the firm's bid, the firm is responsible for               some farction of the cost overrun; if the firm succeeds in                      keeping its cost below its bid, it is reqarded by being allowed                 to keep part of the cost underrun.  Incentive contracts are of                  considerable potential practical importance in Department of                    Defense weapons acquisition and are commonly employed in the                    construction industry as an alternative to fixed price bid                      contracts.  Further, Nash equilibrium bidding theory makes                      several clear and novel predictions for incentive contracts that                have yet to be subject to systematic study.",
