 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Michigan Ann Arbor for the renovation and repair of               the C. C. Little Building which houses the x-ray mineralogical,                 paleomagnetic and rock magnetic, mineral separation, and                        seismological/geodynamics research and research training                        activities of the Department of Geological Sciences.  This                      building was constructed in 1920 and last renovated in 1970.  The               ARFMP grant of $350,000 and $353,570 provided by the grantee as                 cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve             the current research infrastructure by reconfiguring it so that it              is more efficient and by providing adequate power and fume exhaust              systems and environmental controls and computer network                         connectivity necessary for safe and reliable research operations.                                                                                               This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                   graduate students.  Also the laboratories to be modernized in this              project serve as a focus for postdoctoral programs and                          collaborative and cooperative research with university and                      industry throughout the nation and as an informal regional and                  national center for many types of instrument-intensive research in              geology.",
