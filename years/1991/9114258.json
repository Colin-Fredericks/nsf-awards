 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manufacturing operations like rolling, forging, and extrusion are               characterized by interrupted, non-isothermal, large deformations                at high strain rates (104sec-1) and high homologous temperatures                (0.5 to 0.9).  There is very little test data available to validate             and/or refine constitutive relations proposed to describe the                   material behavior under these loading conditions.  The purpose of               this research is to perform experiments on Fe-2% Si and Ti6A1-4V                in a split Hopkinson torsion bar at different strain-rates and                  various values of the homologous temperature.  These test data and              others available in the literature will be used to delimit the                  functional forms of constitutive relations, and also to find values             of material parameters.  The predictive capability of these                     constitutive equations will be ascertained by comparing                         analytical/computed results with experimental findings under                    loading conditions different from those used to establish them,                 including dynamic loading of specimens pre-strained quasistatically             in a direction different from that of dynamic loading.  The                     developed constitutive relations will be used to analyze extrusion              and hot forging processes, and the effect of loading rate and                   initial specimen temperature upon the initiation and growth of                  shear bands in forging, torsion, and combined loading.  The study               will combine a thorough theoretical/numerical effort with careful               and accurate experimental investigation.  The close collaboration               and integration between the experimental and theoretical work                   should help formulate reliable constitutive relations that can be               used to analyze other high strain-rate processes such as machining              and penetration of metallic targets by fast moving penetrators.",
