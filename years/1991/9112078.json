 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Offshore Technology Research Center, a National Science                     Foundation Engineering Research Center is a joint venture between               Texas A & M University and the University of Texas, will design,                build and install a current generating system in its new multi-                 directional wave basin.  The objective is to provide a more                     realistic, scaled, approximation of conditions found in the                     offshore environment.  The conclusion of currents in the wave                   basin will further the study of deep ocean engineering problems                 by permitting the controlled and reproducible combination of                    waves and currents in the laboratory.                                                                                                                           The current generator will expand the OTRC laboratory                           capabilities to include the physical model study of interactions                between waves, currents and offshore structures.  Within the                    context of the OTRC research agenda the most affected thrust                    areas are in (1) Hydrodynamic Loading and (2) Structural                        Integrity of Deep Water Systems.  The expanded experimental                     capability to incorporate currents will result in advances in:                       o the study of the kinematics of long-crested and shorted-                 crested seas in currents,                                                            o the study of hydrodynamic-structural interactions affected               by both waves and currents, such as wake formation, shielding,                  vortex shedding, and structural vibrations, and                                      o the study of the wave and current effects on the drag,                   added mass and damping coefficients of vessels, offshore                        structures and rigid and complaint members within structures.",
