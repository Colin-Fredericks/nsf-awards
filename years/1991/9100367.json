 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Knapp will make systematic use of intertwining                   operators into and out of reducible and irreducible representations             of semisimple Lie groups in order to understand the representations             better.  Two specific areas of investigation are the relationship               of algebraic and analytic forms of representations and the                      introduction of a more direct approach to harmonic analysis on                  semisimple symmetric spaces.  The postdoctoral associate supported              by this award will use micro-local analysis to gain a better                    understanding of the dual of a semisimple Lie group.                                 The research supported by this award is in the area of the                 representation theory of groups.  Groups usually arise as                       transformations which preserve the structure of some system.  For               example, the group of rotations about the center preserves the                  sphere.  In applications the abstract group is not all that is                  needed but in addition a concrete realization of this group, called             a representation.  This project will study the representations                  which arise from a family of smooth groups called Lie groups.",
