 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nutrient limitation of algal growth provokes changes in the                biochemical composition of the cells.  This in turn affects the                 quality of algae as food for upper trophic levels.  Models of the               dynamics of the interaction of herbivores and their food thus                   should include such food quality effects.  This research will                   explore the ways in which algal growth rate changes food quality.               Laboratory demography studies of the freshwater cladoceran,                     Daphnia pulex, feeding on variously limited unialgal and multi-                 algal foods will be undertaken.  These studies will ascertain the               relationship between growth rate and quality in simple systems.                 In addition, food quality effects in natural populations will be                examined through a set of experiments and measurements including                1. assessment of nature and degree of nutrient limitation in                    algal populations, 2. assessment of degree of food limitation in                zooplankton populations, 3. measurement of assimilation                         efficiency of N and P in zooplankton.  These data will then be                  used to explore in theoretical models how the stability and                     tendency for coexistence of herbivore and algae is influenced by                food quality effects.  Results will contribute to the conceptual                basis of limnology and will add to the information base for                     managing aquatic resources.",
