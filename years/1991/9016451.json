 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of six U.S.                           scientists in a joint seminar on \"Computers in Heat Transfer                    Science,\" to be held in Tokyo, Japan, in October 1991.  Among                   the main topics to be discussed are forced convection,                          natural convection, phase changes, radiative heat transfer,                     and heat transfer in combustion.  Experimental, theoretical,                    and a combination of the two approaches will also be featured.                  Significant issues to be addressed are:  (1) in what details                    can we theoretically clarify hitherto unresolved heat                           transfer processes, if the performance of computers is                          upgraded 10-fold or even 100-fold from that of computers                        available today; (2) how far can we improve the accuracy of                     heat transfer measurements if we are equipped with data                         acquisition and processing equipment in the laboratory that                     are more powerful than that currently available by a factor                     of 10 or 100; and (3) what role can heat transfer specialists                   play to develop the technology that is essential in ushering                    in computing equipment that is 10 or even 100 times more                        powerful than those in existence today?                                                                                                                         The advent of computers has played a major role in the                          advancement of the science of heat transfer as well as in the                   solution of many practical problems.  Both the United States                    and Japan have made significant contributions to advance the                    knowledge of heat transfer and are also among the most                          advanced countries in the development and utilization of                        microelectronics and computing technology.  The objective of                    the seminar is to bring together leading researchers from                       both countries in an effective forum to review the current                      impact of computers in heat transfer research and discuss how                   the continuing advances in computer technology will impact                      the development of heat transfer science.  The co-organizers                    of the meeting are Professor Kwangtzu Yang of the University                    of Notre Dame and Professor Wataru Nakayama of the Tokyo                        Institute of Technology.  This seminar is the third in a                        series of joint meetings between the United States                              and Japan sponsored by NSF and the Japan Society for the                        Promotion of Science.  The first was held in Tokyo in 1981                      and the second in San Diego in 1985.",
