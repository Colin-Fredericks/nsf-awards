 "awd_abstract_narration": "Allegheny College requests $332,736 from the National                         Science Foundation to support a program to encourage minority                   students to enroll at Allegheny and to pursue a degree in the                   natural sciences or mathematics.  Allegheny is a private                        undergraduate liberal arts institution with an enrollment of                    1750 men and women students.  Located in the extreme                            northwestern corner of Pennsylvania, Allegheny enrolls                          students primarily from Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio.                        Allegheny has established a reputation for being the best                       liberal arts college in the region and is also well-known for                   its exceptionally strong science and mathematics departments.                   Each year, from 25 to 30% of our students graduate with                         degrees in the natural sciences and mathematics.  When                          Behavioral Science is added to this total, the percentage                       increases to 37.                                                                  To capitalize on this traditional strength and to increase                    the percentage of minority students on this campus, Allegheny                   is proposing a program that will increase the likelihood of                     these students pursuing a degree in the sciences and,                           eventually, scientific careers.  Through a four-year, multi-                    disciplinary program, Allegheny will provide students (up to                    eight a year) with the attention to their academic and study                    skills, career goals, and scientific research skills that will                  ensure their success in the sciences.                                             Students' research skills will be developed through a                         faculty mentoring relationship.  Each student will be paired                    with a faculty mentor in his area of scientific interest and                    together they will work on research that will culminate in the                  requires Senior Comprehensive Project.  Working                                 collaboratively, many of these students will produce work that                  they can present at national conferences or that can be                         published.  Our science faculty's history of such joint                         presentations and publications and publications demonstrates                    that high-quality projects can be achieved through                              \"apprenticeships.\"                                                                Mr. John C. Reynders will director our \"Research Careers for                  Minority Students\" program Mr. Reynders is special assistant                    to the provost and director of the Educational Enhancement                      Program at Allegheny.  He will work with a group of at least                    eight faculty mentors, chosen from all of the science and                       mathematics departments.  Faculty and administrators will                       report regularly to Provost Andrew T. Ford.  Provost Ford                       fully supports implementing this special program.  At the end                   of the proposed five-year cycle for this program, the provost                   and the president of the College, Dr. Daniel F. Sullivan, will                  decide whether to continue our program.",
