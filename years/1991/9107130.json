 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will study the evolution of communication in                          populations of agents, situated in simple, artificial                           environments.  The primary research methodology is experimental                 and task-oriented in nature, involving the simulation of                        populations of male/female ANNs, using genetic operators (i.e.                  recombination, mutation and selection) that are applied to                      initially random populations of genotypes (which specify ANN                    connection weights and biases).  Current simulations are being                  done both on computer workstations and a 16K Connection Machine                 (CM-2), whose massive SIMD parallelism is particularly suited to                such simulations.  These initial simulation studies will be                     headed in several direction -- ones that will support the                       evolution of more complex forms of communication.  These                        directions include: (a) evolving more complex ANN architectures,                (b) introducing multiple, distinct species in the environment,                  (c) adding simple forms of learning, metabolism and morphology,                 (d) augmenting our instrumentation for analysis and                             interpretation of the \"meaning\" of the dialects that evolve, and                (e) increasing the complexity of the terrain and physics of the                 environment.",
