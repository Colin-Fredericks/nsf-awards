 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering Lower Division Laboratory MaterialsFaculty at West                  Virginia University, University of Wisconsin - Platteville, and                 Colorado School of Mines are addressing the criticism of                        engineering education that it is weak in design, and while                      producing engineers who excel at analysis, lack skills in                       design, synthesis and evaluation.  Many educators propose                       changes in curricula and instructional methods aimed to                         integrate these skills back into the learning experience.                       While many innovations have merit and work well for their                       developers, educators elsewhere often experience difficulty                     incorporating them into their particular environment. The                       faculty are developing lower-division electrical engineering                    design oriented laboratory materials and plan to evaluate their                 effectiveness in three very different curricular environments.                  A student booklet of laboratory design exercises and an                         accompanying instructor's manual describing in detail how to                    conduct a design-oriented laboratory is being developed from                    the most broadly successful draft materials.  The materials                     transform the laboratory from the relatively passive                            intellectual experience of verifying well established theories                  to an active intellectual experience creating functional                        devices, circuits, and systems.  The student materials are                      heavily supported by extensive aids for the instructor, and all                 materials are designed for and evaluated within disparate                       curricular structures to make them broadly useful.",
