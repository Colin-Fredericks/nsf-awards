 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is the reactivity of vanadium                         bromoperoxidase isolated from marine organisms (e.g.,                           Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus distichus Macrocystis pyrifera).                     The marine environment is a very rich source of halogenated                     and selectively oxidized metabolites, many of which have                        important biological activities (e.g., chemical defense,,                       antimicrobial), and applications as pharmaceuticals                             (antineoplastic, antiinflammatory, antifungal, antibacterial)                   and specialty chemicals (e.g., dyes).  V-BrPO catalyzes the                     bromination of certain organic compounds and the oxidation of                   others.  The PI has shown that in the absence of a good                         substrate for bromination, V-BrPO catalyzes the formation of                    singlet oxygen.  V-BrPO is not inactivated by high                              concentrations of singlet oxygen or oxidized bromine species,                   contrary to the behavior of the FeHeme haloperoxidases.  The                    plan is to investigate the selectivity of bromination vs                        oxidation for important marine natural product precursors                       (e.g., indoles, furans, B-diketons and B-ketoacids), the                        kinetics and mechanism of bromination and oxidation.  The                       mechanism of chloroperoxidase activity of the vanadium enzyme                   which the PI has recently discovered , will also be                             investigated.  The non heme chloroperoxidase from the fungus                    Curvularia inaequalis will be studied, including                                determination of the active-site metal ion (e.g., likely to                     be iron, zinc or vanadium), the kinetics and mechanism of                       halogenation vs dioxygen formation, and the relative                            reactivity of oxidation vs halogenation.",
