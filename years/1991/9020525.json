 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of carbamates and benzofurans which are either                         commercially used or generated as industrial waste are highly                   toxic.  The N-methyl carbamates used as pesticides inhibit                      cholinesterase activity. They persist in some environments,                     causing serious health hazards. These compounds are generally                   biodegraded via hydrolysis or oxidation.  Hydrolysis processes                  are relatively slow. While the oxidation mechanisms are rapid                   generate highly toxic metabolites, for example aldicarb (LD=0.9                 mg per Kg) is oxidized to equally toxic aldicarb sulfoxide and                  then to aldicarb sulfone. Therefore, knowledge of the metabolic                 pathways involved in the detoxification of carbamates and                       benzofurans is important for their safe use and disposal.  We                   have selected carbofuran (2, 3 dihydro-2.2- dimethyl-7                          benzofuranyl methylcarbamate) as model compound represented both                carbamates and benzofurans to investigate the biochemical                       pathways and genetic determinants involved in its degradation. In               our previous studies several microorganisms capable of degrading                carbofuran and other carbamates were isolated.  These isolates                  utilize carbofuran as sole source of carbon or nitrogen.  A                     Flavobacterium sp. 50085, harboring a plasmid pRC200 encodes                    functions for the hydrolysis of carbofuran.  Another bacterium, a               Pseudomonas sp. 50432 harbored several plasmids and rapidly                     detoxify carbofuran.  One of the plasmids, pCF2 was determined to               be involved in the oxidation of this compound.  The proposed                    study is designed to investigate the mechanism of biochemical                   oxidation of carbofuran in strain 50432.  These studies will                    involved the following: 1) physical mapping of the plasmid                      pCF2:2) purification of the enzymes responsible for the oxidation               of carbofuran: and 3) generation of transposon insertion mutants.               The results of this study are expected to improve our                           understanding of catabolism of carbofuran in Pseudomonas sp.                    50432.  This should then help in developing microbial agents                    capable of decontaminating soils/waters polluted with carbamate                 and benzofuran compounds as well as in devising strategies for                  improving the efficacy of pesticides and for their safe                         environmental use.",
