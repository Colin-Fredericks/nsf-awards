 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaboration in quantum field theory                   between a physics research group at the University of                           Pittsburgh led by Daniel Boyanovsky, and a group at the                         Pontificia Universidade Catolica in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,                     led by Carlos Aragao de Carvalho.  Based on a conjecture                        that a recently fixed point theory describes the critical                       properties of thin film layers of superfluid HeII in a                          substrate potential, the project aims to study with pertur-                     bative and non-perturbative techniques both the renormalizable                  and the superrenormalizable regime in statistical mechanics                     theories in which both order and disorder operators are                         present.                                                                                                                                                        The research is designed to lead to an understanding of the                     renormalization aspects of theories in higher dimensions in                     which topological excitations play a leading role in describing                 the dynamics.  The project involves topics in quantum field                     theory that are of common interest to both the U.S. group and                   the Brazilian group, and in which the collaborators in both                     groups have experience.  The joint project will enable the                      two groups to combine their expertise and expedite the                          research results.",
