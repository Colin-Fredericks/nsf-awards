 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is designed to achieve a comprehensive,                           system-wide transformation of the Montgomery County Public                      Schools, Maryland (MCPS) system's elementary (pre K-5)                          science curriculum.  The new curriculum stresses student                        inquiry leading to science process skills as well as                            science content and positive attitudes toward exploration                       and cooperative learning.  The transformation will be                           spearheaded by a group of 40 experienced \"lead teachers\"                        who will each receive a minimum of 6 weeks of training and                      will then train \"liaison teachers.\"  There will be one                          liaison teacher per grade level per school (approximately                       860 liaison teachers in all) who will then act as mentor/                       coaches to other classroom teachers.  Some of the liaison                       teachers will also work with the lead teachers to train the                     more than 1500 classroom teachers; classroom teachers will                      each receive a minimum of four days of training that will                       introduce them to the philosophy and pedagogy of hands-on                       teaching and learning, and instruct them in the use of the                      units adopted for their grade level.                                                                                                                            This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because of its systemic plan to enhance the science                     teaching of all teachers of elementary science in the                           district.                                                                                                                                                       Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 152% of the amount                        requested from NSF.",
