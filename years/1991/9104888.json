 "awd_abstract_narration": "We plan to investigate the hydromechanical properties of                   closely related group of scaphitid ammonite species in the context              of their phylogenetic framework and their distribution with respect             to time, lithofacies, and geography.  We have chosen an endemic,                monophyletic group of approximately 25 species ranging from the                 Turonian to Santonian (Upper Cretaceous) of the Western Interior                of North America.  These species preserve in their shells a record              of their growth and manifest profound morphological changes during              ontogeny, eventually developing an uncoiled body chamber at                     maturity.  In addition, these species display a wide diversity in               adult shell shape ranging from relatively compressed species with               a well-developed \"scaphitid\" body chamber to relatively depressed               species in which the body chamber is \"normally\" coiled.  Using a                flow tank and drag measuring apparatus, we will study the                       hydromechanical implications of ontogenetic changes in size and                 shape for each species.  This will allow us to construct species                specific hydromechanical ontogenetic trajectories (HOT's) covering              all of postembryonic growth.  We will supplement this information               with studies of the siphuncle and septa, which may provide                      information on relative habitat depth.  We will compare these HOT's             with the paleoenvironmental and evolutionary distribution of the                respective species within the well documented context of the                    Western Interior Seaway.  Thus, this comparison will elucidate for              the first time the extent and way in which functional                           hydromechanical constraints have contributed to the evolution and               geographic distribution of a closely related group of ammonites.",
