 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator is proposing a                  new numerical method for the study of the behavior of solids                    suspended in a viscous fluid.  The method combines finite                       difference approximations to solve the field equations with                     Lagrangian fluid markers to track the positions of the solid                    particles in the fluid.  The suspended material is replaced with                an appropriate force-density term in the equations of fluid                     motion.  This method is capable of handling a large number of                   particles since there is no need to specify boundary conditions                 on the surface of each particle and since one set of                            equations obtains in the whole flow field.                                           The behavior of particles suspended in a viscous fluid is an               interesting physical phenomenon that has wide-ranging                           biological and technological importance.  In this project the                   principal investigator will apply a novel numerical method in                   order to solve approximately the coupled fluid-solid equations                  that describe the motion of solid particles suspended in a fluid                under realistic general conditions.  The need for accurate                      simulations of such suspension flows arises in areas as diverse                 as medicine (blood flow), civil engineering (control of                         sedimentation in rivers) and design manufacturing (ceramics and                 composite materials).",
