 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science, it is frequently argued, merits its primacy in its                     knowledge claims because of its experimental foundations.  It is                not based on prejudice, superstition, astrology, common sense                   beliefs or even divine revelations, but rather on the disciplined,              public interrogation of nature known as the \"experimental method.\"              Recent scholarship in the sociology of science, however, has                    challenged this presumed experimental foundation for modern                     science.  One of the leading sites for debate about the                         experimental method has centered around Robert Boyle, the 17th                  century chemist who was one of the most important original                      exponents of the experimental method.  Advocates of this                        revisionist view argue that Boyle's experimental practices                      \"involved in the generation and justification of proper knowledge               were part of the settlement and protection of a certain kind of                 social order.\"  Under her previous grant, Dr. Sargent began a                   \"counter-attack\" on this social constructivist view of Boyle and                the philosophy of experiment.  She argues that Boyle advocated the              experimental method not for social and political purposes but for               the advance of science.  Under this new grant, she is continuing                her efforts to provide a systematic account of the details of                   Boyle's experimental practice and the manner in which he defended               it against the serious criticisms of other natural philosophers of              his day.  Not only will this study help to explicate Boyle's                    sophisticated arguments in favor of the experimental method, but                it promises to make valuable contributions to current debates in                the philosophy and social studies of science about the role of                  experiment in the advance of science.",
