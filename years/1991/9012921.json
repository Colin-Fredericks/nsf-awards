 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the history of global sea level changes                           has relevance to a wide range of studies in earth sciences.                     Along with a former graduate student and his colleague Dr.                      Joann Stock at Harvard, Dr. Molnar proposes to conduct                          indirect measurements of sea level back to 84 Ma, estimate the                  errors involved in the technique, and with these constrained                    ranges of values, prepare interpretations regarding the effects                 on past climate, global heat flux and sea floor spreading rates.                The technique requires calculating the mean age and area of                     the ocean floor at discrete times in the past.  Both                            calculations require plate reconstructions based on marine                      magnetic anomalies, and this work has been done over the last                   several years by Molnar and Stock.  From these reconstructions,                 and from an empirical relationship between seafloor age and                     depth,\"mean depths\" can be estimated.  Based on the                             plate configurations and knowledge of continental                               histories, palinspastic reconstructions of continental                          lithosphere will provide estimates of the areas of ocean basins.                These calculations were done during thesis research by Jose Rosa                at 35 and 59 Ma, where he found that sea level was 72\u001a .\u001a26 m and               173\u001a .\u001a56 m above present, respectively.  The present award                     will allow Rosa to continue this work with Stock, and to complete               similar analyses at 11, 20, 42, 49, 69, and 84 Ma.  While similar               work has been done by others (e.g. Kominz, 1984), the precision                 of his plate reconstructions, his proposed error analysis, and                  the estimates he will make concerning the effects of 1)                         seamounts, 2) hot-spot swells, and 3) sediment displacement of                  ocean water, will result in the most tightly constrained set of                 sea level estimates yet made.",
