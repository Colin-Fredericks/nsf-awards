 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                  will allow the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State                    University at University Park to acquire a mini-super class                     computer system.  The research studies to be performed include                  the following:  Protein Crystal Structures, Molecular Dynamics                  Simulations of Solvation, Quantum Chemistry by Random Walk,                     Computer Simulation of Macromolecular Structure and Function,                   Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Surface Reactions,                            Simulations of Molecular Liquids and Physisorbed Layers and                     Computer-Assisted Studies of Structure-Property and                             Structure-Activity Relationships Using the ADAPT computer                       software system.                                                                                                                                                The computational demands of modern chemical research require                   the proper computing system that would avoid wasteful                           bottlenecks by balancing a variety of computational                             capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware                   and software maintenance, support personnel and training in all                 areas of computational chemistry.  Many new insights into the                   kinetics of chemical reactions can be developed through                         theoretical studies with use of mini-supercomputers when the                    experimental data are inaccessible.  In addition, the most                      cost-effective computers are the mini-supercomputers.",
