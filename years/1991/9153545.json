These include                 (a) a three-week Summer Workshop at the Graduate Center of the                  City University of New York (CUNY) in which they are developing                 expertise with computers; (b) ten Saturday Sessions for field                   trips to museums, research laboratories and universities; (c)                   after school science/mathemtics clubs which meet on a weekly                    basis to facilitate networking; and (d) Prep Time for 8th grade                 students which is preparing them to take the Secondary School                   Aptitude Test (SSAT).  This project integrates scientists into                  all activities and, thus, provides for continual access to                      information and role models.",
