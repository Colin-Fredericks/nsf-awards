This building                was constructed in 1951 and has not been renovated since that time.             The ARFMP grant of $500,000 and $590,250 provided by the grantee as             cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research              training facilities.  The project will address the need to improve              the current research infrastructure by providing central air                    conditioning; adequate power lines; and adequate power, water,                  vibration-free tables, benches, shelves and other essentials; and               additional fume hoods.                                                                                                                                          This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of undergraduate and graduate students at the                  only institution in the state of Arkansas that offers the                       doctorate in physics.",
