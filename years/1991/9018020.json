 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some insect parasites that lay eggs in their hosts inject special               secretions into the host along with their eggs.  These secretions               appear to have two effects.  First, they protect the parasite's                 eggs from the host's immune defenses and second, they cause arrest              of host development.  For Campoletis sonorensis, both phenomena may             be induced by a polydnavirus (PDV).  PDV is the only animal DNA                 virus with a heterogeneous, segmented genome.  Several viral gene               families have been identified, and viral gene expression is tissue              and/or host specific.  Through evolution the parasite has acquired              the ability, which is essential for its survival, to assemble,                  amplify and transfer this genetic information in a viral form to                another eucaryotic host.  Prior results from this laboratory have               shown that one family of the venom-related (VR) wasp and                        polydnavirus (PDV) genes belong to the \"DEAD\" protein family whose              members are implicated in the control of gene expression at the                 levels of translation and splicing.  This suggests that these                   unique genes may regulate splicing or translation of wasp and/or                host genes.  Recent studies show also that three CsPDV genes                    contain a cysteine motif characteristic of peptide toxins.  The                 presence of this motif may reflect a function as a ligand of cell               surface receptors which may correlate with parasite survival.                   Polydnavirus expression products and venom secretions may be more               related in \"host regulation\" phenomena than previously thought.The              next stage of this research will be directed toward identifying                 these expression products and determining their functional                      significance.                                                                                                                                                   The life cycles of certain wasps involve a stage at which they are              parasites on other insects such as moths.  The adult wasp lays its              eggs by injecting them into the body of a larval moth.  Special                 secretions are injected along with the eggs.  These secretions                  contain factors that protect the eggs from the host's immune                    defense mechanisms and arrest the development of the host.  In at               least some such parasite/host relationships, a virus is an                      important component of this interaction.  This laboratory is                    approaching this complex problem by identifying parasite and virus              genes and gene products involved in this relationship.  The overall             goal of this research is to understand the molecular basis of the               parasite-induced avoidance of host insect defense systems.",
