 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project plans to study the distributional effects of                       distortionary tax policy.  In most analyses of tax reform, the                  question of how tax policy affects agents with different                        preferences, endowments or investment opportunities is not                      addressed.  In the case of dynamic economies, the main reason for               this omission is that the task is computationally formidable.                   However, preliminary indications show that numerical methods used               in fluid dynamics and structural mechanics for solving partial                  differential equations may be applicable.  This research                        investigates their application to a model with heterogeneous agents             and distortionary taxation.                                                                                                                                     The project requires several planning activities.  The first is to              test the methods on cases for which there is a known solution.                  Such problems usually involve a distortion-free economy inhabited               by identical agents.  The second is to test the methods on models               with identical agents and distortionary taxes.  For some models of              a distorted economy, there exists a transformation of parameters                or variables which makes it resemble a distortion-free economy.                 For both sets of test cases, alternative numerical methods will be              used to validate the results.  Preliminary results show that finite             difference techniques perform well and may be sufficiently                      efficient for maximum likelihood estimation.  Finally, the                      alternative finite-element and variational methods will also be                 explored.",
