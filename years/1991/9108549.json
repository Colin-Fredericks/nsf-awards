 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Lawrence Robbins                 and George Brook will conduct archaeological excavation and                     related geological research in the northwestern portion of                      Botswana.  Previous work in the Tsodilo Hills region has revealed               the presence of deeply stratified archaeological deposits in the                White Paintings shelter (WPS).  These included abundant faunal                  and lithic remains as well as floral materials which are                        extremely rare in prehistoric African sites.  The team will                     conduct two seasons of excavation and hope to uncover deposits                  which exceed 40,000 years in age.  Materials will be analyzed by                a team of experts.  In conjunction with the excavation,                         geological study will be conducted at Tsodilo and in surrounding                regions.  This will provide a broader context for interpreting                  the WPS and will enhance regional perspectives on Kalahari                      paleoenvironments.                                                                                                                                              The Tsodilo Hills region is unique in Africa because hunting and                gathering peoples still inhabit the region and it is highly                     probably that this cultural group is directly descended from the                prehistoric inhabitants of the shelter.  Because of this, it will               be possible to combine ethnographic and archaeological data and                 to interpret the latter in ways not normally possible.  Given the               time depth of the site it should also be possible to gain insight               into the prehistory of this |Kung San group.  Preliminary                       evidence indicates that in the distant past, these Bushman                      hunter-gatherers employed different subsistence patterns.                                                                                                       This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed new               light on a part of Africa where the prehistory is poorly known.                 Secondly, it will place the present |Kung San groups into broader               chronological perspective.  For several decades this group has                  been intensively studied by anthropologists and has been                        portrayed in textbooks as the \"archetype\" of a hunting and                      gathering society.  This model has recently been challenged and                 arguments advanced that |Kung San culture was altered well over a               millennia ago by contact with agricultural and pastoral groups.                 Excavation at WPS should shed new light on this issue.  Finally,                this research will examine the mechanisms which a technologically               simple society employed to adapt successfully to a harsh and                    variable desert environment.",
