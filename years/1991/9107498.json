 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in statistics                    and probability between Dr. James Marron, University of North                   Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Professor Wolfgang Hardle,                         Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.  The objective of                      the research is to study bandwidth selection and construction                   of confidence bands/error bars for additive multivariate                        regression models                                                                                                                                               The proposed research concerns nonparametric regression,                        especially in the multivariate case.  The two main problems                     to be addressed are smoothing parameters (i.e. bandwidth                        selection) and data based assessment of the accuracy of                         estimators (in the spirit of confidence intervals).  Non-                       parametric regression provides a powerful tool for providing                    insights in situations where no widely accepted model is                        available, or where there is some doubt concerning the                          appropriateness of a given model.  For practical applications,                  the two improvements most needed are a really reliable                          method of bandwidth selection, and a means of assessing the                     variability of the estimator. Both Drs. Marron and Hardle                       have a strong record of past joint research, which will be of                   benefit to this proposed collaboration.",
