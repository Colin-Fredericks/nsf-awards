 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sexual recombination as well as mutations provides the genetically              variable raw material upon which evolutionary forces act in higher,             more complex organisms.  Thus, based upon that assumption, sex has              been considered an important, almost necessary, component of the                evolutionary process. However, Dr. Matthew Meselson of Harvard                  University describes a class of animals, Bdelloidea, which, in so               far as has been determined, has no sexual genetic exchange. But,                as he points out, sexual exchange may occur under rare or at least              unknown circumstances and a more rigorous test is needed to confirm             the fact that an organism which has been successful in evolution                is lacking any mechanism for genetic exchange. He proposes to use               restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) as a test.                     Specific species of Bdelloidea, thought to be diploid, will be                  selected as test organisms. Isolated DNA will be fragmented with                restriction enzymes and the extent of heterozygosity will be                    determined. The underlying assumption is that sexual organisms                  homozygous their chromosomes much more rapidly than do asexual                  organisms. The project can be done within the one year limitation               and is high risk in that if the answer is that there is little                  heterozygosity seen in the rotifer DNA, the organisms probably have             some type of sexual mechanism and thus, are of little interest for              further study. If, on the other hand, the answer is that there is               a large amount of heterozygosity in their DNA, then significant                 insights into our understanding of evolution can be achieved by                 asking the proper questions.***                                                                                                                                 \f//",
