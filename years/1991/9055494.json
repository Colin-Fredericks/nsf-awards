 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will provide training over a two and one-half                     year period to enhance content preparation for 60 under-                        prepared or uncertified intermediate school teachers in                         minority districts in New York.  Under the aegis of the City                    College of New York, CUNY and in cooperation with local                         school districts and the Bronx High School of Science                           Regional Resource Center (funded by the Department of                           Education), the City College will establish 3 District                          Resource Centers for intermediate school science teachers in                    the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens.  The                          project entitled \"Science in the Twenty-First Century:  The                     Science 21 Project\", will provide training to the 60 teachers                   in minority school districts through linking college courses                    focused on the content of the middle school curriculum with                     training in inquiry pedagogy provided by university and                         Regional Center trained peer leaders to be located in the                       boroughs of the Community School Districts listed above.                                                                                                        For each of the designated years of the project, a cohort of                    30 under-prepared and/or uncertified intermediate/junior high                   school science teachers per year (for a total of 60                             participants) will attend courses given by the City College                     five days per week for four weeks (90 hours) and earn tuition                   free graduate credits. During the course of the project the                     teachers will have taken courses in physical science, life                      science, and earth science, earning six tuition-free graduate                   credits per course totalling 18 graduate credits.  Training                     will take place during the summer and the academic year.                                                                                                        In summary, through teaching content to under-prepared                          teachers in minority school districts, the program is                           enabling teachers to provide appropriate content to their                       students and to increase their own professional standing.                       Through linking the City College School of Education, the                       Bronx Science Regional Resource Center and local school                         districts, a network of trained teacher leaders is being                        created who will be in place as local trainers after the                        conclusion of the project and who will have ongoing access to                   the resources of the supporting institutions.                                                                                                                   Cost sharing equals 72% of the NSF award.",
