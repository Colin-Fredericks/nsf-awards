 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scientists Institute for Public Information (SIPI), a                  non profit organization of scientists and media professional                    that works to strengthen reporting of science, will organize                    annual briefings for television news directors and producers by                 leading scientists during the next three years.  Each year 35-                  50 local news directors from across the country will meet face-                 to-face with nationally prominent scientists for two days of                    discussions of leading stories in science, health and the                       environment.  Science is underreported on commercial                            television, and this targeted intervention has a substantial                    opportunity to directly improve the quality and quantity of                     science reporting by America's television industry.                                                                                                                  SIPI's Media Resource Service has developed an                             international reputation for its provision of scientific and                    technical sources for journalists.  The prototype TV News                       Director's Briefing, held March 10-12 1989, demonstrated in a                   practical way the potential of the project, reaching 35 key                     journalists from 17 states.  The briefings will be attended by                  a geographically distributed group of professional scientists                   and journalists who are well supported in their discussions by                  extensive pre-meeting work by SIPI staff.  Extensive news                       coverage of the topics discussed will take place and be                         documented by SIPI staff.  A continuing evaluation study by an                  independent contractor will analyze the impact of the briefings                 on the participants.  NSF support will amount to 28% of the                     $660,000 project total.",
