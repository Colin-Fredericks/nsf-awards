 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of graph labellings and their applications is an                important mathematical subject.  It interacts with graph theory,                combinatorics, group theory and non-associative algebras.  The                  study of graceful directed graphs leads to the construction of a                non-associative algebraic structure called a neofield.  Graph                   labellings has applications to other branches of mathematics,                   computer science, engineering, operations research and social                   sciences.                                                                            This grant will partially support a conference on graph                    labellings and their applications to be held at Northeastern                    University in March 1991. The conference will feature hour talks by             three experts in the field and will bring together additional                   leading researchers who will present shorter talks.  There will be              strong emphasis on applications and possible interactions with                  industry.  The informal structure of the conference will provide an             excellent opportunity for young researchers and graduate students               to become involved in this rapidly growing area.",
