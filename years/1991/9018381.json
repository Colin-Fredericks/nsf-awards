 "awd_abstract_narration": "The magnitude of the Yellowstone fires of 1988, which were the                  largest fires every experienced in a national park within the                   continental United States, has created an exceptional opportunity               to address some of the central questions in ecology today.  Drs.                Romme, Turner and Gardner will use the Yellowstone National Park                fires to ask three basic questions: First, how climate and                      landscape pattern interact to create situations in which                        extremely large fires are possible.  The investigator's previous                experience suggest that there may be thresholds in parameters of                landscape structure and meteorological conditions that interact                 to control fire size.  They propose to identify the thresholds                  and then use them in a modeling approach to explore the                         implications of global climate change for Yellowstone's                         disturbance regime.  Second, Drs. Romme, Turner and Gardner ask                 how fire size affects landscape pattern.  They hypothesize that                 landscape heterogeneity is greatest with fires of intermediate                  size and least with very small or very large fires.  They will                  test this hypothesis by using remotely sensed imagery and the                   Park's geographic information system.  Third, they ask how plants               having different modes of reproduction respond to fire size,                    severity, and heterogeneity.  They will sample areas burned from                1972 to 1988 in three successive field seasons to test specific                 hypotheses relating landscape parameters (e.g. the size of a                    burned patch, distance from an unburned edge, and internal                      heterogeneity of a burned patch) to the reestablishment of                      individual species and to community richness.                                                                                                                   This investigation of Yellowstone fires will not only help us                   understand the events of 1988 but will provide insights into                    interactions between vegetation patterns and ecological processes               in all landscapes.  Drs. Romme, Turner and Gardner are                          international experts in the area of landscape ecology.  The                    facilities for this research are excellent.",
