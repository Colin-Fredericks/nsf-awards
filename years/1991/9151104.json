 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project constructs a series of \"showcase\" experiments for                  the undergraduate chemical engineering laboratories at Ohio                     University.  The emphasis of these experiments is their visual                  nature, allowing for a vivid demonstration of underlying                        engineering principles.  Traditional experiments in                             undergraduate laboratories can be greatly enhanced through the                  use of clear tubing, color change reactions and real-time data                  display. Experiments are planned in multiphase mixing, reaction                 kinetics, fluid flow, heat transfer, process control and                        materials analysis.  The experiments serve many purposes: they                  are used as experiments in the undergraduate laboratory                         courses, as demonstration projects in the appropriate                           undergraduate lecture courses, and as demonstration experiments                 for a \"Taster\" course in chemical engineering being implemented                 by the department. This course is an intensive two-day                          experience for high school students designed as an introduction                 to chemical engineering.  The ability to let the participants                   conduct visually dynamic experiments is critically important to                 excite these students to pursue a career in chemical                            engineering.",
