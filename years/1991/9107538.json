 "awd_abstract_narration": "The modeling and analysis of dynamic bifurcation phenomena                 is important in science and engineering because experiments are                 often performed by dynamically tuning one or more parameters                    until destabilization causes a transition to a new observed state               or behavior.  Using numerical and computational methods, this                   project will investigate accommodation phenomena in                             spatially-unrestricted axons and myelinated nerve segments.  A                  primary goal is to establish the interrelationship between                      passive loading (both conductive and capacitive) and                            accommodation in nerve cells and how it affects signaling.  The                 project requires computational and analytic bifurcation studies                 of reaction-diffusion equations with slowly varying boundary and                interface conditions.  Another objective is to classify and                     explore how different kinds of random fluctuations influence                    accommodation in nerve models.  Stochastic perturbation methods                 for exit time estimates and numerical simulations will be                       employed.                                                                            In neuroscience, threshold and accommodation experiments at                the cellular level are performed by slowly depolarizing an                      excitable membrane by ramping or stepping up an applied current.                Such experiments to investigate accommodation phenomena in                      spatially-unrestricted axons and myelinated nerve segments are                  important for understanding why and how conduction failures occur               in partially demyelinated nerve; debilitating diseases such as                  Multiple Sclerosis can induce lesions that partially demyelinate                the myelin sheath.  In addition, many of the tools developed in                 this project are useful for studying dynamic bifurcation                        phenomena, which occur in many other areas of science and                       engineering.",
