This Committee                 will advise Federal agencies through the interagency Committee                  on Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES) Working Group on                     Global Change on scientific planning for the U.S. Global Change                 Research Program.  The CGCR will: (1) formulate scientific                      recommendations for coordinating the U.S. Global Change                         Research Program with internationally planned activities; (2)                   provide liaison between international and U.S. planning                         efforts by serving as the U.S. national committee for the                       international programs on global change; and (3) hold                           frequent meetings with representative of the CEES Working Group                 on Global Change to assure coordination of NRC activities and                   to communicate science needs of the U.S. Global Change Research                 Program.  The CGCR will coordinate its activities with those of                 other NAS/NRC boards and committees working in related areas,                   and will develop a comprehensive NAS/NRC proposal, to be                        submitted to the Federal agencies for FY 1992 funding, that                     will encompass all NAS/NRC activities undertaken primarily for                  issues related to global change.",
