 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will acquire                           items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool                   of shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for                      use on or in association with the three research vessels                        operated by the Institution.  A substantial part of the                         ships' operating schedules in recent years and again in 1991                    is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The                          instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the                      ships and of the institution to support research and                            engineering activities.  The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                          -An integrated meteorological sensor and data system (IMET).                     A modern instrument package will be installed to make                           underway, continuous measurements of air temperature and                        humidity, wind velocity, and other variables,                                  -Shipboard data management systems and components for real-                      time acquisition, management, analysis, and display of large                    environmental and geophysical data sets,                                       -Water purification system to provide reagent grade pure                         water for chemical analyses at sea,                                            -Shipboard remote sensing computer and image display                             equipment to provide scientists on board with near real-time                    data collected from satellites,                                                -A disk drive system and other peripheral equipment,                            -Precision acoustic pingers for determining position of an                       instrument package relative to the surface or seafloor,                        -Precision temperature and conductivity sensors for                              continuously monitoring and recording sea surface                               temperature and salinity while the ship is underway,                           -replacement water sampling bottles for collecting discrete                      seawater samples at specific depths,                                           -Satellite communications gear for scientific data transfer                      and communications ashore,                                                     -Underwater spectroradiometer for measuring chlorophyll and                      other optical properties in the water column,                                  -a deck control unit for a CTD that collects precision                           Temperature and Conductivity data as a function of Depth,                      -Box corer for obtaining seafloor sediment samples,                             -Acoustic command and tracking system for interrogating and                      activating deployed instruments,                                               -Replacement x-ray tube for fluorescence laboratory,                            -Grating drive upgrade for inductively coupled plasma atomic                     emission spectrometer,                                                         -Calibrated hydrophones for testing ship installed acoustic                      systems, and                                                                   -an ultra cold freezer for storing samples during transit                        from sea to shore laboratory.
