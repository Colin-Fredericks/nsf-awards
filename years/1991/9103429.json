 "awd_abstract_narration": "On 28 January 1989, the Argentine supply ship Bahia Paraiso ran                 aground near Palmer Station, Antarctica, spilling 180,000 gallons               of diesel fuel, jet fuel and heavy lubricants into the marine                   environment.  The spill, which coincided with the feeding,                      fledgling and dispersal stages of the area's six most abundant                  seabird species, exposed 36,000-43,000 chicks and adults to the                 oil.  The focus of this study is to determine the impact this spill             has had on seabird populations in the Palmer area.  From prior                  research at Palmer Station during 1987-1989, there is current data              on the abundance, breeding success, diets and growth rates of the               more numerous members of this seabird community, including marked               chick cohorts form 1988 (not exposed to oil) and 1989 (exposed to               oil).  This data will be used as baseline information in a                      comparative study designed to assess seabird mortality in the area              and determine the population's potential for recovery.  The                     availability of similar baseline data is rare among oil impact                  studies on seabird communities as a whole.  The proposed study thus             becomes uniquely valuable, not only in terms of assessing the                   impacts of an oil spill on a comparatively pristine polar seabird               community, but as a potential source of critical data for seabird               impact studies in general.",
