 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to carry out an in-depth                 analysis of multi-stage, multi-product production/inventory                     systems.  The research first focuses on the identification of                   effective manufacturing strategies and their investigation over an              array of performance measures.  The development of exact and                    approximate analytical models for these strategies and their                    incorporation into a queuing network based decomposition approach               constitutes the bulk of the effort in years two and three.                      Industrial collaboration is involved in all phases.                                  Models of production/inventory systems frequently arise in                 design and performance studies of manufacturing systems.  Despite               their potential applicability, their use is not widespread.  This               is due mainly to the limited capability of existing tools for                   analyzing manufacturing systems.  The development of manufacturing              strategies for multi-product, multi-stage production/inventory                  systems should lay the groundwork for more comprehensive tools and              therefore greater applicability of analytical approaches to                     production system environments.",
