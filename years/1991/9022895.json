 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in physics                       between Dr. Robert Brandenberger, Brown University and Dr.                      Anne Christine Davis, University of Cambridge, England.                         The proposed research deals with the role which topological                     defects that arise in many particle physics models play in                      cosmology, and conversely, with the constraints that can be                     put on particle physics models by investigating their                           cosmological consequences.                                                                                                                                      Topological defects are playing an increasing role in                           cosmology.  They are invoked in many theories to explain                        the origin of galaxies, clusters and the large-scale                            structure of the universe.  Specifically, it is proposed to                     study the microphysics of topological defects.  Cosmological                    consequences of some non-standard particle physics models                       will also be explored.  These studies may provide new                           information about the state of matter at energies which                         will never be accessible in accelerators. This project will                     benefit from the complementary expertise of the US                              investigator in cosmological applications and the experience                    in field theory of the British collaborator.",
