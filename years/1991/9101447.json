 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of a set of studies addressing the issue                  of acidity in zeolites and related materials.  Intermediates                    in                                                                              H-ZSM-5 are studied spectroscopically - nuclear magnetic                        resonance being the prime tool - to characterize species whose                  stoichiometry and reactivity have been established separately;                  the objectives are the determination of the structure of the                    intermediates, the nature of their interactions with the                        zeolite lattice, and the barrier heights for them to undergo                    further transformations.  The effect of various dealumination                   procedures and the roles of framework and nonframework                          aluminum concentrations are examined by preparation of and                      investigation of the acidity of a series of well-characterized                  H-Y zeolites; acidity surrogates used include temperature-                      programmed desorption and thermal gravimetric analysis of                       amines, alkane cracking, and alkali-metal poisoning.  A series                  of metal-substituted ZSM-5 and ALPO-5 molecular series are                      prepared and examined to determine the relative acid strengths                  of these materials and to determine the necessary conditions                    for maintaining the metal ions in the framework.                                                                                                                Zeolites are already widely used in the petroleum and                           chemicals industries both as catalysts and separations media.                   Despite this, factors influencing their performance are poorly                  understood.  This work promises an approach to more rational                    design for applications of zeolites and related framework                       materials, better quality control over synthetic zeolites, and                  possible new applications of known or new framework materials                   in chemical processing, environmental control, and other                        areas.",
