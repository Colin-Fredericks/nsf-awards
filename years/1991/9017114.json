 "awd_abstract_narration": "The value of time-series measurements for the understanding of                  natural processes, the assessment of anthropogenic effects on                   the environment, and the entire complex of issues referred to                   as \"Global Change\" is increasingly appreciated.  This proposal                  requests funds to continue time-series sediment trapping at                     depths of 500, 1500, and 3200 m in the sargasso Sea for three                   years.  At this time, the 3200 m series extends over twelve and                 a half years.  It is by far the longest such series in                          existence, and its sampling site has been designated the JGOFS                  time-series site in the North Atlantic.  Together with the                      hydrographic time series at nearby Station \"S\" and with the                     growing number of JGOFS measurements, it provides an unequaled                  data base on physical, chemical and biological variables in the                 open ocean.  The series has demonstrated the existence of                       temporal variability in the deep ocean, revealed the efficiency                 of processes removing materials from the surface ocean, and the                 effects of those processes on the chemistry and biology of the                  deep ocean.  Continuation of the Bermuda series will be an                      efficient route                                                                 towards identifying the forcing functions of carbon flux to the                 deep ocean, assessing decade-scale trends in the efficacy of the                \"biological pump,\" and monitoring transport of antropogenic                     components to the deep ocean.//",
