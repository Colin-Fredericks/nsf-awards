 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project ATMOSPHERE will over a  five-year period (a)                            establish a permanent national network of precollege                            Atmospheric Education Resource Agents, (AERAs) (b) produce                      scientifically accurate, up-to-date, and pedagogically sound                    resource and instructional materials aimed at teachers, and                     (c) disseminate and implement these materials.  It is part                      of a national program of the American Meteorological Society                    designed to encourage teachers, grades 5-9, to use the                          atmospheric environment to heighten interest in and                             relevancy of science.  An extensive training program                            followed by annual renewal sessions will produce a steady-                      state network of 70 to 80 AERAs.  With representation in                        every state, the network will build on the strengths of                         resource agents who come to the project as recognized master                    teachers and professional leaders in their home areas.  They                    will participate in project materials development and will                      play major roles in disseminating information and                               implementation activity.                                                                                                                                        Phase I atmospheric education will be done at National                          Weather Service Training Centers (NWSTC) workshops.  Drawing                    teachers from these; 60 AERAs will receive Phase II training                    in year 1 in this project's 2-week workshop.  In year 2, 3,                     4, and 5 60-80 AERAs will receive Phase II and Phase III                        training at 2-week workshops.  Workshop sites are Boulder,                      CO and Norman, OK in alternative years.  In year 3, 4, and 5                    there will be 1-one week follow-up workshops for 55                             teachers.                                                                                                                                                       A minimum of 2 peer-led workshops will be delivered by                          increasing numbers of AERAs each year, beginning with 24                        teachers in year 1 and increasing to 94 teachers by year 3.                                                                                                     The teacher enhancement materials to be developed include                       200 reference and resource papers on atmospheric environment                    topics, annually-published newsletter/information packets,                      and 10 self-contained instructional modules.  Dissemination                     will range from mailings of materials to the offering of                        informational sessions by AERAs.  The instructional                             materials will implemented in workshops arranged and                            conducted by AERAs.  Approximately 1,000 information and                        training sessions will take place with an estimated 20,000                      teachers enrolled.                                                                                                                                              The Project Director for this comprehensive project is                          Dr. Ira Geer.
