 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Anthony Marks, Ms Amy Campbell will                  conduct research for her doctoral dissertation.  She will analyze               stone tool assemblages from a number of Middle Paleolithic sites                from Nubia, the Negev, the Near East and Western Europe to                      understand the manufacturing process which produced \"denticulate\"               types of tools.  These collections are housed in museums both in                Europe and the United States.  Middle Paleolithic cultures were                 widespread in the Old World and date to periods greater than                    40,000 years ago.  While archaeologists have focussed their                     analytic efforts on some types of stone tools which are included                in such lithic assemblages, denticulate pieces have received                    little attention.  A denticulate is defined by closely spaced                   notches along the edge of a stone flake which create a saw tooth                effect.                                                                                                                                                         The Middle Paleolithic period is of great interest to                           archaeologists because it is during this time that anatomically                 modern humans first appeared.  Scientists want to understand what               cultural adaptations are associated with this emergence and the                 main body of data available consists of stone tools.  Through                   classification of these into different types and the study of                   variation within types they are able to make inferences about                   both the cognitive abilities and the social organization of their               makers.  It is surprising that so little attention has been                     focussed on denticulate because they are widely distributed and                 are common in most assemblages.  Ms Campbell's work will increase               our understanding of how they were manufactured and what                        functions they served.                                                                                                                                          This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                insight on the factors which led to the emergence of modern                     humans.  It will provide data of interest to Old World                          archaeologists and will assist in the training of an extremely                  promising young scientist.",
