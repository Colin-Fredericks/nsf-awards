 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will prepare software and associated written                       material to introduce computational chemistry into the first                    two years of the chemistry curriculum.  Computational                           technology is one way to illustrate chemistry as it is                          practiced today.  It gives students hands-on experience with                    the models that we use at the molecular level in a way                          previously unavailable.  The software will enable students to                   carry out atomic and molecular electronic structure                             calculations on simple atoms and molecules that are discussed                   in introductory courses.  IBM PC and Macintosh computers will                   operate the software.  The software and written materials will                  be disseminated widely via organizations such as Quantum                        Chemistry Program Exchange and Project Seraphim.  Work will                     also be submitted for publication in JCE:Software and the                       Journal of Chemical Education, and to software firms that                       market molecular modeling (molecular mechanics) software.  This                 inexpensive technology could be used by any two-year community                  college or four-year undergraduate institution.",
