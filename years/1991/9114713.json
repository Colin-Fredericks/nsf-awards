 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ceramic matrix composites ar a new class of advanced materials                  intended for high temperature engineering applications.  They                   exhibit enhanced strength and fracture toughness over monolithic                ceramics due to the interaction of a propagating crack with the                 second phase reinforcing material.  Theories for the mechanisms of              toughening in brittle matrix composites, based on crack bridging                and a fracture process zone, have been developed over the past few              years.  While these mechanisms have been studied in detail for both             continuous fiber and whisker reinforced ceramics at room                        temperature, their fracture behaviors at elevated temperature are               not well characterized.                                                                                                                                         The first goal of this research is the development of a new                     experimental approach which will provide a quantitative measure of              fracture processes at high temperature.  The approach involves a                simple experimental technique which permits simultaneous                        measurement of crack growth resistance curves and direct                        observation of microscopic fracture processes during controlled                 loading over a temperature range of 20-1,7500C.  The second goal is             to study the behaviors of three important and well characterized                materials, representing a range of properties: SiC whisker                      reinforced alumina, Nicalon fiber/LAS glass ceramic, and                        carbon/carbon composite.                                                                                                                                        The primary significance of the research is that it will provide                the tools to determine the fundamental mechanisms of fracture and               deformation of ceramics at high temperature.  With these tools,                 materials developers can design ceramic matrix composites with                  improved fracture behavior and application designers will be able               to predict the reliability of their structural components under                 high temperature conditions.",
