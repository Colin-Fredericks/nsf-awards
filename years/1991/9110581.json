 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic integrity constraints arise in many traditional and non-                traditional database applications; however, such constraints are                not supported by current database management systems.  This                     project focuses on efficient methods for checking dynamic                       integrity constraints in databases.  Past Temporal Logic and Past               Metric Temporal Logic are proposed as constraint languages,                     making it possible to formulate both qualitative and quantitative               temporal conditions.  The project includes the development and                  the implementation of a method to reduce dynamic integrity                      checking to static integrity checking.  If this method is used,                 past database states do not have to be stored for the purpose of                dynamic integrity checking.  Instead, compressed historical                     information is stored in every database state as auxiliary                      relations.  The definitions of the needed auxiliary relations are               automatically derived from the constraints.  Techniques that                    optimize constraint checking and issues that arise from the                     integration of this new method with existing database management                systems will also be addressed.  The proposed research will                     significantly enlarge the application scope of database                         management systems and will make it easier to integrate these                   systems with real-time processes.",
