 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is the first phase in establishing a Parallel                     Applications and Software Laboratory that will be a component of                the Indiana University Center for Innovative Computer                           Applications (CICA).  This laboratory will build upon the                       resources of an established center to provide a facility where a                staff of trained people will work directly with scientists from a               variety of disciplines to design new parallel applications and to               study the effectiveness of specialized tools for parallel                       programming, program restructuring and performance visualization.                                                                                               The research mission of the laboratory will be to use the domain                of real world applications to study the problem of designing                    scalable parallel software.  Our specific research projects for                 this laboratory are: (1) To apply and evaluate existing parallel                programming tools to real applications in the physical and social               sciences.  (2) To investigate the utility of higher level, object               oriented abstraction mechanisms in the design of parallel                       applications.  In particular, we will use a new programming                     methodology based on object oriented design that will allow us to               compile programs for a wide variety of massively parallel                       architectures.  (3) To extend the state of the art in performance               analysis tools so that they are able to predict performance as                  machine and problem sizes are scaled.  This involves the design                 of a new generation of algorithm visualization tools that                       incorporates parallel complexity models and static and dynamic                  analysis of parallel programs with analytical models of machine                 behavior.",
