 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mobilization of protein reserves in the germinating seed                    requires the action of a number of proteases at appropriate times               during growth of the embryo.  Four such proteases have been                     identified in the mung bean (Vigna radiata): proteinase F, vicilin              peptidohydrolase, and carboxypeptidase I and II.  The levels of                 these proteins in mung bean cotyledons will be quantified at                    different stages of seed development and germination using specific             antibodies.   cDNA clones in lambda-gt11 for each of the proteases              will be isolated and used as specific probes to characterize and                quantitate protease mRNA levels.  These results will be combined                with those for the in vitro translatability of protease gene                    transcripts, and the direct determination of protease activities.               These studies will pinpoint the level of control of synthesis to                transcription, mRNA processing, translation, post-translational                 processing, or a combination thereof.  The levels of proteases and              their mRNAs in cotyledons detached from the embryonic axis shortly              after germination will also be examined.  Detachment of the                     cotyledons disrupts the normal pattern of changes in the proteases,             and may offer insight into the role of phytohormones in the                     regulation of these enzymes.                                                                                                                                    An important part of seed germination and seed viability is the                 mobilization of stored food reserves such as carbohydrate, protein              and lipids.  Little is known about the mobilization of protein                  reserves in the seeds of higher plants.  It is not known why                    different protein-degrading enzymes appear in different amounts at              different times during germination or how this process is                       controlled.  The work described in this proposal will develop the               molecular tools to study the regulation of the synthesis of four                different enzymes involved in protein degradation in mung bean                  seeds.  The development of these tools will offer in the future the             potential for controlling the process of protein degradation which              would impact agriculture, particularly the malting and brewing                  industries.//",
