 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first experimental study of the effect of magnesium                 content and precipitation rate on the  13C of magnesian calcite.                Magnesian calcite (Mg-calcite), calcite with roughtly greater                   than 10 mole percent MgCO3, is an important and often dominant                  component of shallow marine sediments, and serves as a Mg and CO3               source for subsequent dolomitization.  Surprisingly, the 13C                    fractionation between Mg-calcite and HCO3 has never been                        determined.  Experimental procedures have been developed for the                precipitation of calcite and aragonite at constant rates in                     solutions of constant temperature and chemical and isotopic                     composition.  Eighty-five previous experiments yield calcite-                   HCO3 and aragonite-HCO3 13C enrichment factors averaging 1.0 and                2.5% respectively.  Calcite-HCO3 enrichment factors ( cl-HCO3-)                 do not vary significantly with temperature (10o to 40oC) or                     precipitation rate (103.0 to 105.2 umol m2hr1).  Aragonite-HCO3                 enrichment factors ( ar-HCO3) show a weak correlation with                      temperature, suggesting that  ar-HCO3 decreases 0.020%oC-1.  Only               in experiments at 10o and 25oC does  ar-HCO3 exhibits a weak                    inverse correlation with precipitation rate.  The project                       includes roughly 30 experiments at 25oC over a range of                         precipitation rates between 2 and 5 umol m2 hr1 for solutions                   having Mg/Ca ratios of 5 to 20, producing Mg-calcites with 7 to                 20 mole % MgCO3.  Determination of these Mg-calcite-HCO3 13C                    fractionation relations will permit researchers to better                       quantify the original isotopic composition of marine sediments                  and waters, vital information for studies of global change and                  carbonate diagenesis.",
