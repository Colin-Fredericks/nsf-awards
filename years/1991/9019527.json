 "awd_abstract_narration": "When polymeric fluids flow, individual polymer chains may become                deformed by hydrodynamic forces.  Understanding this deformation                process is a central research goal of polymer rheology, as the                  conformational dynamics of individual chains ultimately create                  non-Newtonian flow properties.  Despite this obvious importance,                few attempts have been made to study directly polymer chain                     dynamics in flow.  In this project, low-angle light scattering is               used to probe the stretching and orientation of polymers in                     steady uniaxial elongational flow of dilute solutions.  Results                 from the previous funding period indicate that the level of chain               stretching in a model flow, created between opposed jets, may not               be as great as previously suggested by indirect optical methods                 (birefringence) or current molecular theories.  The physical                    mechanisms responsible for controlling the rate of deformation                  and the ultimate deformation level of flexible polymers are now                 being examined by varying molecular weight, solvent type and                    quality, elongation rate, and backbone stiffness.  Experiments                  are being conducted in a recently completed light-scattering                    apparatus capable of low-angle measurements off an extremely                    small scattering volume located at a stagnation point.  These                   measurements will be complemented by birefringence studies and                  flow experiments in more transient stress environments.                                                                                                         This research aims to understand macromolecular behavior in flow,               which is of fundamental scientific importance as well as in                     technology, such as fiber spinning, turbulent-drag reduction, and               enhanced oil recovery.",
