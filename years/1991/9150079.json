 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is investigating the cognitive and motivational                    development of diverse groups of high school students as they                   work with highly visual, dynamic simulations of the laws of                     random phenomena as exhibited in a wide variety of physical,                    biological and chemical systems.  Students manipulate models of                 physical reality in a fashion similar to the modelling methods                  used by the research scientists who are conducting this project.                The investigators hypothesize that students underrepresented in                 mathematics and science, including women and minorities, will                   particularly benefit from these visualization tools and from                    their participation in current scientific research.  Research                   questions include the following:  What is the cognitive                         significance of pairing hands-on experiments with compute models                in learning activity?  What are the cognitive consequences for                  students of working with dynamic, time-dependent representations                of systems and phenomena that are impossible to represent                       directly in prose or still photographs?  What are the                           consequences of multiple representations, such as liquid water                  viewed at a microscopic and macroscopic levels?  What are the                   central anchoring concepts students need in order to use dynamic                visual models to explore and understand both the scientific                     processes of modeling and the concepts of randomness and order in               nature?  What are the consequences for high school students and                 teachers of cognitive apprenticeships with graduate students who                are carrying out the research modeled in the teaching materials?//",
