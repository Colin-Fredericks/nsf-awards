 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will facilitate continued collaboration between                      Professor Anthony L Fink, University of California, Santa                       Cruz, and Associate Professor Yugi Goto, Department of                          Biology, Osaka University, Japan.  The scientists will                          investigate the protein conformational state known as the                       molten globule and its role in protein folding reactions.                       The goal of the research is to increase our understanding of                    the molecular details and physical properties of molten                         globules and to determine whether they may be important in                      certain physiological processes such as membrane transloc-                      ation.  Research has indicated that molten globule-like                         states are of critical importance in protein folding, protein                   denaturation and probably in vivo protein function. In order                    to establish generalities, a variety of biophysical techniques                  will be used to structurally characterize the molten globule                    state from several different proteins.  In addition, kinetic                    experiments using stopped-flow fluorescence and CD will be                      performed.  An increase in our understanding of the deter-                      minants of protein folding and stability has important                          implications for most aspects of proteins and their functions,                  including drug design and proteins for medical and industrial                   uses.                                                                                                                                                           The US and Japanese scientists involved in this effort have                     complementary skills and experience in studying structural                      and functional properties of proteins and enzymes.  Both have                   obtained significant funds for their individual efforts on                      this problem and their previous collaborations have been                        highly productive, and their research original and important.                   Their continued joint efforts should contribute to our                          understanding of proteins in a wide variety of ways.",
