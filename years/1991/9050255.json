 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, Masters II:  Math and Science Teachers for                        Reservations Schools II, is a renewal of a previously funded                    program which will serve 117 teachers of Native American                        children in grades K-9.  Teachers will be selected from the                     entire United States, but especially from the sixteen states                    with schools serving predominantly Native American students.                    Each year, thirty five teachers from public and Bureau of                       Indian Affairs (BIA) schools will participate in intensive                      eight-week workshops to improve their mathematics and science                   content and pedagogy.  Six of these teachers will be selected                   to participate for a second and third year eight-week workshop                  during the two subsequent summers.  These selected teachers                     will mentor new participants, develop their leadership skills                   and work closely with agency and education personnel to effect                  change in their own local school districts. This project design                 of building leaders through their three-year involvement holds                  real promise for effecting change.                                                                                                                              Curriculum materials, especially adapted for their                              effectiveness with Native American students, will be used                       extensively.  An existing BIA funded electronic network, ENAN,                  will facilitate the networking so important for teachers who                    are spread across the country.                                                                                                                                  The University of Kansas, Haskell Indian Junior College and                     participating school districts as well as the BIA are cost-                     sharing this program.  The bulk of the cost-share is coming                     from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in an amount twice that of                    the NSF request.  This funding supports programs that are                       integrated with the MASTERS project as well as those that                       precede it and support it.",
