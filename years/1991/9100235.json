 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support US participation in a US-UK workshop                    on the topic or rehabilitation robotics, to take place in                       Cambridge, England in April 1991.  The co-organizers are:                       Dr. Richard Howell, Ohio State University and Dr. Ray Gosine,                   Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge.                                                                                                             The rapidly expanding research area which has been termed                       \"rehabilitation robotics\" is dedicated to the development of                    functional robotic assistive tools for use by severely                          physically disabled individuals in home, work or educational                    environments.  As a new area of endeavor, rehabilitation                        robotics is composed of information from the disciplines of                     engineering, rehabilitation, education and computer science.                    The task of merging these disparate areas into a cohesive                       effort is made more difficult by the few operational research                   projects from which to draw information, and which are quite                    isolated from one another throughout the world.  The proposed                   workshop will feature an international gathering of research                    scientists in rehabilitation robotics, who will present                         summaries of current research efforts and discuss a series of                   topics focusing on the disabled use of robotic devices.  The                    topics will include:  the user interface, safety issues in                      robotic environments, the needs and perceptions of the users,                   and user acceptability of robotic devices.  In addition,                        sessions are proposed on the current progress in hardware and                   software, and aspects related to commercialization of robotic                   systems.",
