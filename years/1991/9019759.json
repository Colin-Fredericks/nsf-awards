 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to assess the effects of                              substituent and solvent variations on proton transfer                           reactions of organic molecules.  For appropriately                              substituted amines and carboxylic acids, he will conduct                        proton transfer equilibrium measurements in selected                            solvents.  Recently developed substituent parameters                            (resonance, field/inductive and polarizability) will be                         used to identify, quantify and analyze substituent effects                      on the basicities and acidities of these molecules in                           various solvents.  Comparison with reported gas phase                           basicities and acidities will allow solvent attenuation                         factors (SAF) to be determined.  The SAF values will                            provide detailed insight into solvation effects on each                         species involved in the proton transfer reactions.                              Attention will then be focused upon the structurally more                       complicated alpha-amino acids which possess both amino and                      carboxyl functional groups in a single molecule.                                Substituent and medium effects on the acidity and basicity                      of substituted alpha-amino acids will then be evaluated in                      terms of the information gained regarding substituent and                       medium effects on the basicity of substituted amines and                        the acidity of substituted carboxylic acids.",
