 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Venezuela award will support Professor Hal Caswell                    of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in a research                       collaboration with Professor Juan Silva of the Universidad de                   los Andes in Merida, Venezuela.  The investigators intend to                    study the way in which the environment, genetics, development,                  and life history interact to produce a set of vital rates                       (i.e., rates of survival, reproduction, growth, etc.).  By                      incorporating those rates into appropriate structured                           population models, mathematical analysis may be used to                         predict patterns of population dynamics and the sensitivity                     of those patterns to changes in the environment.                                                                                                                The researchers plan to collaborate by combining theoretical                    population models with an experimental program on tropical                      savanna plant populations.  The theoretical research will                       extend statistical tools for analyzing demographic experiments,                 develop matrix models for interacting populations, and                          incorporate quantitative genetics into models of complex life                   histories.  The experimental research will address the                          comparative responses of annual and perennial savanna plants                    to environmental disturbance, competitive interactions among                    savanna grasses, the evolution of seed dormancy, and the way                    these factors combine to determine savanna community structure.                 This approach to population dynamics is a most powerful                         approach to understanding community patterns, including                         diversity, stability, and coexistence.",
