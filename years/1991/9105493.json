 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paleoecological studies have demonstrated that shifts in the               transition areas between grasslands and forests have occurred in                response to climate change, but few such studies have examined                  tropical or subtropical grasslands.  This doctoral dissertation                 project will examine the Holocene vegetation dynamics of the                    southwestern Louisiana prairie, a subtropical grassland.  Pollen,               charcoal, and stratigraphic analyses will be used to reconstruct                the vegetation history and to identify controlling factors in the               development and maintenance of this subtropical grassland.  Core                of lake bottom sediments from Lake Arthur, an estuarine lake with               a drainage basin entirely within the natural tall-grass prairie,                will yield at least a 6000-year record.  Vertical profiles from                 Prien Lake, with a similar origin but with a drainage basin                     outside the prairie, will be used to detect possible shifts in                  the grassland.                                                                                                                                                       This project will provide the first radiocarbon-dated pollen               record of the southwestern Louisiana prairie and will be one of                 few data points for the entire American tropics and subtropics                  that contain a detailed Holocene history of savanna vegetation.                 It will provide a rare opportunity to examine the sensitivity of                prairie vegetation to climate change in a subtropical context,                  thus adding to broader understandings of the effects of climatic                changes.  In addressing the factors of fire, edaphic control, and               human disturbance, the project will add further to this                         understanding by answering questions concerning the origin and                  evolution of a southern grassland.  This project also will                      provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to               continue to develop independent research skills.",
