While                                   these numerical models include the reservoir                                    interaction and the water compressibility                                       effects, they also are sensitive to reservoir                                   geometry and the reservoir bottom reflection                                    coefficient.  A cooperative research project                                    with Chinese researchers is proposed under                                      this project to: a) investigate reservoir                                       interaction effects on arch dams, b) conduct                                    field measurements on a large arch dam in                                       China, and c) make quantitative evaluation of                                   analytical procedures by comparing the                                          measured and calculated results.                                                                                                                                The reflection coefficient of the absorptive                                    reservoir bottom and the actual topography of                                   the reservoir, which are required as input in                                   analytical predictions, are to be determined                                    by field surveys.  Measurements will be made                                    to detect water compressibility and spatial                                     variation of ground motion near the dam-                                        foundation contact.  This excitation                                            technique is expected to produce larger                                         hydrodynamic pressures and better information                                   regarding the dynamic interaction between the                                   dam and its foundation than has been obtained                                   previously using eccentric-mass shakers.  The                                   measured dam response, foundation response,                                     and the hydrodynamic pressures will be                                          compared with analytical predictions using                                      the best current mathematical procedures to                                     validate the accuracy of the analytical                                         techniques.                                                                                                                                                     The final product of the research program                                       will be specific testing procedures to                                          measure absorptive coefficient of the                                           reservoir bottom, measured dam-foundation and                                   reservoir response behavior, and the                                            associated analytical predictions which will                                    be useful for design purposes.",
