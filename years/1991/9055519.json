 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Statistical Association, in collaboration with                     the Baltimore City and County Public Schools, seeks funds                       for a three-year program to 1) develop and deliver in-                          service workshops for elementary school teachers which will                     allow them to implement a quantitative literacy strand in                       their teaching and for elementary school-based                                  administrators to inform them of the content and techniques                     of a quantitative literacy strand so as to ensure proper                        teacher support and implementation of the program; and 2)                       plan and develop quantitative literacy professional                             development materials to support teacher and administrator                      workshops in any elementary school.  The three-year project                     will develop a complete scope and sequence plan, a set of                       modules for the classroom, and model workshops accompanied                      by professional development materials.  Materials and                           workshops will be initially delivered to and field-tested by                    80 teachers and administrators, and the project will                            culminate in five, five-day regional summer workshops                           serving 225 elementary school teachers and 50 of their                          school-based administrators.  Field-tested follow-up                            activities will take place the following school year                            supported by the local school districts and statisticians                       from business and industry.                                                                                                                                     The staff for the project includes nine elementary and                          middle school teachers and administrators from the Baltimore                    City and County Public Schools, plus staff members from the                     American Statistical Association, and mathematics educators                     and statisticians from universities throughout the country.                     In all, 364 elementary school teachers and administrators                       will be enhanced through the workshops.  The quantitative                       literacy professional development materials should provide a                    second-wave effect.  The cost-sharing of the American                           Statistical Association, the Baltimore City and County                          Public School and others represents 64% of the NSF award.                                                                                                       Producing a citizenry which is quantitatively literate is an                    NSF, and indeed a national, priority.  This project                             addresses this priority by bringing a quantitative literacy                     strand into the elementary schools through enhancing                            teachers in appropriate subject matter and pedagogy.",
