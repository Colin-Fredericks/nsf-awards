 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will examine                    several problems involving nonlinear elliptic systems of partial                differential equations in two and three space dimensions.  The                  specific systems to be considered come from the theory of                       nonlinear elasticity, and the principal investigator will study                 the properties of solutions that are the energy minimizers of the               associated variational problems.  Her primary goal is to                        determine various regularity properties of solutions and to                     examine their qualitative behavior.  The main tools to be used                  are previous results of the principal investigator concerning                   maximum principles and a'priori estimates.                                           The solutions of many problems that describe physical                      reality are what mathematicians call \"variational\" solutions,                   that is, the correct physical solution is the mathematical                      solution of a variational problem.   In ordinary language, a                    variational solution is one that maximizes or minimizes a                       fundamental quantity like the total energy of a system.  For                    example, the bubbles in your glass of beer are spherical, because               the spherical shape minimizes the surface energy.  In this                      project the principal investigator will study various                           mathematical properties of solutions of variational problems that               model two- and three-dimensional nonlinear elastic phenomena.",
