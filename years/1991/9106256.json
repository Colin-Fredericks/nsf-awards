 "awd_abstract_narration": "The steady-state level of specific mRNA is determined by the rates              by which this molecule is synthesized and degraded.  Despite the                importance of mRNA turn-over in the control of gene expression,                 the mechanisms that underlie this process are still obscure.  It                is thus the long-term goal of the proposed research to explore the              mechanism of intracellular mRNA breakdown.  In recent studies the               PI has shown that the breakdown rate of the mRNA for PEP-                       carboxykinase (PEPCK) is hormonally regulated and that cAMP (as an              intracellular mediator of glucagon) stabilizes the mRNA against                 degradation.  It has also been demonstrated that 733 nucleotides                from the 3'-region of the mRNA are sufficient to confer the cAMP                regulation of mRNA turn-over.  The main goal of this proposal is                to delineate the nucleotide domains that mediate the cAMP                       regulation of PEPCK mRNA as well as the determinants that confer                the short half-life of PEPCK mRNA.  These studies will involve                  monitoring the half-lives of mRNA transcripts of a variety of                   hybrid genes containing different sequences of PEPCK, after these               genes have been introduced into hepatoma cells.  In addition, we                propose to examine the role of RNA-protein interaction at the cAMP-             responsive element in the control of the half-life of PEPCK mRNA.               It is hoped that these studies will result in a better                          understanding of the molecular events which control gene expression             and also will find a practical use in the construction of an                    efficient expression system in which the control of mRNA stability              is considered when a foreign gene is to be introduced into cells.//",
