 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Drs. James O'Connell                  and Karen Lupo will study the anatomical distribution of meat and               its nutritional value in a variety of East African wild game                    species.  Working in close collaboration with the Kenyan                        government, they will be given access to the carcasses of ca.                   five species of game culled by the Kenyan Wildlife Service.  They               will transport and have the carcasses butchered in a traditional                manner and then determine the amounts of meat and marrow from                   different anatomical portions.  Nutritional analyses will also be               conducted and on this basis the relative \"value\" of each portion                can be determined.  The costs involved in processing can also be                measured and a cost/benefit ratio established.                                                                                                                  Animal bones which represent the remains of meals are often                     recovered from prehistoric African sites and on this basis                      archaeologists attempt to reconstruct prehistoric behavior                      patterns.  Often unexpected and non-random distributions of body                parts are discovered at sites and these can be difficult to                     explain.  In an attempt to solve this apparent puzzle, Dr.                      O'Connell and his colleagues have studied the Hadza, a present-                 day group of East African hunters and gatherers and again the                   results are surprising because they do not conform to a simple                  least effort model.  However, studies which involve controlled                  butchering have never been conducted on wild African species and                hopefully the utility information collected will shed new light                 on this question.                                                                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons.  Because faunal                 remains are recovered from many archaeological sites and                        constitute a major data source, many archaeologists focus on the                analysis of such material.  The information collected by Drs.                   O'Connell and Lupo will provide valuable data which will be                     widely used in many archaeological contexts.  The goal is to                    understand human subsistence strategies and how these developed                 over time.",
