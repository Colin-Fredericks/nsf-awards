 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is not well understood how disturbances such as frequent, low-               intensity (e.g. sublethal) fire have influenced life history                    evolution in plants.  Pityopsis graminifolia is a fire-adapted,                 clonal perennial herb that inhabits frequently burned sandhills                 in Southeastern longleaf pine savannas.  The reproductive biology               of this species differs in two sandhill communities in which it                 has been studied despite the fact that fire results in little                   adult mortality or seedling establishment in either community.                                                                                                  The proposed study has two major objectives.  It will first examine             how low intensity fires change the favorability of environmental                conditions in these two sandhill populations of P. graminifolia.                Specifically, if and to what extent fire reduces the cost of                    flowering and vegetative reproduction (e.g. clonal growth) in this              stress-tolerant species by increasing the availability of nutrients             in each of these communities will be examined.  The impact of                   floral herbivory and seed predation following fire in each of these             sites will also be examined. The significance of their impact in                light of the phenotypic variation in reproductive behavior                      exhibited by this species following fires in each of these sandhill             communities will be assessed.  Results may indicate how fluctuating             environmental conditions during the life of a plant influence life              history evolution.  The second goal of the study is to address how              the dynamics of flowering and clonal growth respond to fires that               differ in their historical, evolutionary importance (e.g. growing               season vs. dormant season fires).  In particular, whether the more              profuse flowering and fruiting of shorter duration following                    historically important growing season fires reduces the impact of               floral herbivory and/or seed predation in this species will be                  assessed.  Evidence of this kind could provide insight regarding                the adaptive significance of growing season vs. dormant season                  sublethal fires in longleaf pine savannas.",
