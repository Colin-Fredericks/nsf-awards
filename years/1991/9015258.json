The unit of                                      analysis is the local jurisdiction (i.e.,                                       cities and counties).  The universe is all                                      jurisdictions in Seismic Zone 4 in the state                                    of California.  Quantitative data will be                                       gathered from a stratified random sample of                                     jurisdictions.  The first objective will                                        involve an attempt to specify and test a                                        model explaining various stages of completion                                   of a program for identifying and reducing the                                   hazardousness of pre-1934 unreinforced                                          masonry buildings (URMs).  The model will be                                    tested using logistic regression analysis.                                      The second objective will involve comparisons                                   of organizational characteristics of building                                   departments in the sample of jurisdictions                                      for Fiscal Years 1989 and 1990 (i.e., the                                       year prior to and the year following the                                        October 4, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake).                                        Results should help to assess the prospects                                     for developing an empirically-verified                                          knowledge base in the area of hazard                                            mitigation upon which public policy may                                         comfortably rest.",
