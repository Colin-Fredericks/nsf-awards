 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to determine how much molecular               variability exists at a gene coding for the structure of an                     esterase enzyme, EST 6, in Drosophila melanogaster and to                       understand the meaning of this molecular variation.  Esterases                  are particularly interesting genes to study because they are                    representative of a class of highly variable loci found in many                 organisms including humans.                                                          The general objective of the work is to assess the                         hypothesis which argues that changes in the expression of genes                 are more significant in evolution than changes in the regions of                genes which code for the structure of proteins.  Dr. Richmond                   will identify elements responsible for the regulation of the Est-               6 gene and a similar gene, Est-P.  He hopes to associate                        variation which controls expression with variation which controls               the structure of two related esterases.  Studies of molecular                   variation in Est-6 genes from different geographic populations of               Drosophila melanogaster will help to identify the molecular basis               for geographic variation.  Finally, Dr. Richmond hopes to obtain                molecular clones for the Est-6 genes from two other Drosophila                  species related to Drosophila melanogaster to determine what                    changes have occurred in these genes during the process of                      speciation.                                                                          Recombinant DNA technologies will be used to clone and                     manipulate esterase gene sequences.  Factors regulating the                     expression of esterases will be investigated by using                           transposable-element mediated transformation of Drosophila                      embryos with cloned esterase genes.  Procedures for the                         amplification of specific genes from total genomic DNA will be                  used to obtain DNA for direct nucleotide sequencing.  Reliable                  data on the nature and extent of genetic variation will permit                  inferences on how the forces of evolution act to mold variation                 at the molecular level into adapted phenotypes.  This work will                 also contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms of gene                   regulation and how the evolution of regulation occurs.",
