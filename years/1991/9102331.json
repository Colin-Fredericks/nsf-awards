 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop and test a new framework              for modeling family decision-making based on game-theoretic                     marriage markets.  The first part of the project will integrate                 altruism into marriage market models. The second part of the study              will explore the empirical consequences of such models and their                interrelations with bargaining models.  The goal is to produce                  structural models of marriage and family demands and to empirically             estimate such models.  Understanding the economics of family                    decision-making is crucial to many important policy issues,                     including the impacts of taxes and subsidies at the macro and micro             levels, the implications of varieties of child care and child                   support programs, the impacts of aid to developing countries, as                well as marriage, divorce, fertility, births to unwed mothers and               mortality rates by age and sex.",
