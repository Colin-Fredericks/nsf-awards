 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the study of the factors which control the                secretory function of the adrenal medulla (the inner portion of the             adrenal gland) during fetal development using the pregnant sheep                as the animal model.                                                                                                                                            The adrenal medulla is active in early fetal life and responds to               stressful stimuli by releasing catecholamines into the circulation.             In the immature fetus before the establishment of functional neural             input to the gland, the adrenal medulla can respond directly to                 stress such as hypoxia.  During maturation, there is a transition               from direct to neural control of adrenal medullary secretory                    function such that in the mature fetus and adult, adrenal medullary             function is entirely under neural control.  The neurotransmitter                mediating the neural control is acetylcholine.  In the present                  project, the hypothesis that the adrenal peptide vasoactive                     intestinal peptide (VIP) is the mediator of the direct control will             be tested.  Two specific objectives will be investigated.  First,               the effectiveness of VIP and acetylocholine in stimulating                      catecholamine release and biosynthesis in the adrenal medulla will              be determined in sheep fetuses at early, mid and late gestation.                Secondly, the appearance of receptors for VIP and acetylcholine on              the fetal adrenal medulla at these gestational ages will be                     examined.  The maternal adrenal medulla will be similarly studied               for comparison.  The hypothesis that in the immature fetus, the                 adrenal medulla responds to VIP stimulation but not to cholinergic              stimulation because of the lack of cholinergic receptors will be                tested.  As the fetus matures, responsiveness of the adrenal                    medulla shifts from VIP to acetylcholine in association with the                appearance of cholinergic receptors.  The results from these                    studies will provide understanding for the factors which regulate               adrenal medullary function during fetal life, and the maturation                of these events leading to adult type of function.//",
