 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this research is to support established                   paradigms in programming language research in order to reduce                   programming effort and shorten development time.                                Constraint logic programming (CLP) is a new class of programming                languages whose basic operation is constraint solving over a                    computation domain.  CLP languages are best used for combinatorial              problems that often require considerable expertise and development              time.  Typical examples include scheduling and formal verification of           circuits.  CLP languages presently support partial enumeration                  (subsuming branch and bound and backtracking) as the main paradigm.  A          successful representative of the first generation of these languages            is CHIP which is now widely used in industry (e.g., at Siemens, Bull            and ICL) for tasks like the scheduling of ships in Hong Kong harbor.            This project will develop a second-generation CLP language, extending           the support for combinatorial problems in three directions:                                                                                                       1.  Constraint handling:  new reasoning and pruning techniques will                 be incorporated by providing new primitive operations such as                   constraint entailment and new ways of combining primitive                       constraints;                                                                                                                                                2.  Execution models:  dynamic programming and local search will be                 investigated in order to incorporate them into CLP languages;                                                                                               3.  Computation domains:  the project will investigate new                          application areas such as computational geometry and                            parsing where constraints play a fundamental role in order to                   identify new computation domains.",
