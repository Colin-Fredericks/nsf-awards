 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to provide renewal support for a project                       previously conducted under NSF Grant No. 87-14640 in which                      an existing 1.5 Mev, 50 ma, electron accelerator located                        at the Virginia Key Wastewater Treatment Plant in Miami                         was used to study electron-beam applications in                                 environmental engineering practice.  Results confirmed the                      effectiveness of the electron beam for inactivation of                          microorganisms in aqueous suspension,  destruction of                           organics contaminants in aqueous solution, and defined                          reaction rate constants associated with destruction of                          organic contaminants in water.                                                                                                                                  Research in this project includes expanding studies of                          dose-destruction relationships for polycyclic aromatic                          hydrocarbons, identification of reaction mechanisms and                         byproducts produced by electron beam irradiation,                               exploring methods for more efficient presentation of the                        fluid to the beam, study of radical scavengers and                              enhancers to improve the beam's efficiency, and                                 development of cost models for determination of economic                        feasibility of electron beam use in environmental                               engineering practice.                                                                                                                                           Results of this research conducted at a sufficiently large                      scale to obtain engineering design parameters are likely                        to be utilized in environmental engineering practice.                           Potential applications include design of processes and                          systems for decontamination of surface and groundwaters,                        destruction of hazardous wastes, treatment of sludges                           derived from treatment of wastewater to improve their                           dewaterability and amenability to stabilization processes,                      disinfection of sludges and processing byproducts and to                        improve their biodegradability or removal from aqueous                          solution by other physical or chemical processes.",
