 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research consists of studies of chemical                      processes of importance in the atmosphere which involve cloud                   particles.  There are strong indications that polar stratospheric               clouds are chemically very active, transforming stable chlorine                 compounds to a form that efficiently promotes ozone depletion.                  The studies in this proposal are aimed at elucidating the                       mechanism for such processes, and at measuring parameters such as               chemical reaction rates, which are needed to model the behavior                 of the polar stratosphere and to predict future effects of the                  release of man-made chlorofluorocarbons.                                             More specifically, the PI plans to characterize the various                ices of atmospheric interest (which consist of water with                       varying amounts of HNO3, H2SO4 and HCl) by means of thermal                     analysis techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry,                  and by infrared and ultraviolet spectrophotometry and to measure                the vapor pressures of HCl for the various ices as a function of                the ice composition via mass spectrometry.  The PI also plans to                determine reaction probabilities for ClONO2 and N2O5 vapors                     interacting with ices containing amounts of HCl which are                       appropriate for stratospheric conditions.",
