 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major obstacle in design research is a representation and                language to describe a design problem, interpret the design, and                recognize modifications to the design to support design innovation.             As a significant step toward solving this problem, a graph-based                representation will be developed which abstracts essential                      geometric descriptions of a body to a level where modification and              interpretation of the body becomes computationally feasible.  The               anticipated graph not only represents an abstract model of the                  geometry of the body, but also models physical constitutive                     relations and behavioral design constraints.                                         The graph can be expanded based on optimization information,               modeling the process of design innovation.  A language of features              is then defined on the graph representation to describe and                     interpret the design computationally; the language will be built                on top of the graph to recognize features modeled in the geometric              representation and adjust design constraints accordingly.  This                 research is part of a long-term goal to create a design environment             which can reason about a design problem at various levels of                    abstraction to support the rapid generation of solution concepts.",
