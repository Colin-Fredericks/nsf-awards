 "awd_abstract_narration": "In its thirty years of existence, finite element analysis has                   become an indispensable tool of engineering.  Because of its wide               applicability, the present lack of knowledge of this complex method             among U.S. engineers is costly to our economy and to the                        competitive position of our nation.                                                                                                                             The purpose of this proposed project ISAIAH (the Interactive                    Structural Analysis Instructor and Helper) is to utilize modern                 hypermedia technology to research and develop an Interactive Finite             Element Analysis Knowledge Base on a microcomputer laser disk to                provide:                                                                        (1) engineering students with \"hands-on\" experience combined with               interactive instruction and                                                     (2) practicing engineers with interactive assistance during pre-                processing and post-processing,                                                 to improve the quality of finite element analyses and the resulting             quality of U.S. engineering.  As a first step toward this goal (to              be realized in privately-funded Phase III), a proof-of-concept                  Prototype Frame Analysis Assistant on a microcomputer diskette will             be formulated and tested in Phase I to:                                         (1) verify the feasibility of the hypermedia approach, and                      (2) test its effectiveness with engineering students and                        practitioners.                                                                                                                                                  With non-Federal funds, an interim Interactive Frame Analysis                   Knowledge Base will be developed in Phase 1.5.",
