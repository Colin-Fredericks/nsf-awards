 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Shields and others have recently found many new                  interpretations of entropy in such diverse areas as string                      matching in DNA analysis, prefix generation and Hausdorf                        dimension, recurrence and waiting time problems in probability                  theory, Markov order estimation, statistical problems associated                with recognizing a process from its sample paths, and hypothesis                testing.  In his project, Professor Shields will extend and                     sharpen these recent results and will further develop the                       theoretical properties of processes which have connections with                 entropy.                                                                             Professor Shields' work is on the interface between abstract               and applied information theory.  The concept of entropy,                        originally developed in physics, and of crucial importance for                  the second law of thermodynamics, is the mathematical realization               of the vague idea of disorder or lack of information.  This                     concept continues to bear fruit in many fields including those                  mentioned above.",
