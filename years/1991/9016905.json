 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will continue an ongoing research project to explore            the implementability and utility of Equational Logic Programming .              The project has already produced a compiler for an equational                   programming language, in which a program is a set of equations, an              input is a term, a computation is a derivation of certain logical               consequences of the equations in the program, leading to the output of          a term in normal form equivalent to the input.  Novel features of the           language include a total refusal to compromise semantics for                    performance, leading to a uniform use of \"lazy\" evaluation-- a                  technique in which precisely the information demonstrably relevant to           the final output is automatically computed-- and a lazy input/output            facility, which gives the consumer of a term dynamic control of its             computation.  The current version of the compiler uses partial                  evaluation of intermediate code as an optimized compilers for C.                Continuing research will include the study of more sophisticated                evaluation techniques to improve performance, the performance                   implications of applying those techniques to other languages,                   theoretical advances to extend the class of equational programs that            can be compiled, the semantic ramifications of introducing modular              programming constructs, and experimentation with advanced user                  interfaces, including structure editor interfaces.",
