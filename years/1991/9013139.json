 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two faculty investigators in the projects                        described below, F. R. Cohen and S. Gitler, as well as two of                   their graduate students involved in thesis research.  All of the                research concerns algebraic techniques in topology.                                  F. R. Cohen intends to consider problems in classical                      homotopy theory and some offshoots to the cohomology of certain                 discrete groups.  Three of the main projects involve (1)                        improving his bounds on the exponent of a mod-2-to-the-r Moore                  space, r at least 2, and trying to extend some results to the                   case when r is 1, (2) a study of the Whitehead product involving                spaces of rational functions together with their interplay with                 Cayley-Dickson algebras, and (3) the cohomology and stable                      structure for the classifying space of certain discrete groups                  called mapping class groups.  Some of these problems involve                    configuration spaces and are part of joint work with S. Gitler                  and L. Taylor (University of Notre Dame).                                            S. Gitler intends to consider several problems centered on                 mapping spaces, their cohomology, and their relationship to                     homotopy theory.  For example, he intends to study maps (X,Y) and               their cohomology for \"good\" spaces X and Y.  Setting Y equal to a               space in the omega-spectrum for Morava K-theory, K(n), one gets                 useful examples of spaces with periodic homotopy groups.  Gitler                intends to study applications of these spaces.",
