 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's practicing engineers run their simulation models                   iteratively to help create product designs, often through ad hoc                strategies for multiple runs.  It has been observed that: (a)                   there are efficient strategies for planning multiple simulation                 runs; (b) many of these techniques are common across all                        engineering disciplines; and (c) there is a void in the United                  States engineering curriculum in this area.  The objective of this              effort is to create a modern course in engineering design, with a               focus on the exercise of computer models to improve the performance             and manufacturability of device and system designs, not just to                 analyze existing designs.  An interdisciplinary course will provide             a common language and approach that will allow engineers from                   different disciplines to work together more effectively.  This will             result in better designs for products and systems.                                   This effort represents a unique and innovative mechanism for               training engineers in engineering design.  Tools of simulation will             be combined with a case study approach using extensive industrial               collaboration.  The modular development of this interdisciplinary               course will facilitate its transfer and use by manufacturing                    engineering programs throughout the country.",
