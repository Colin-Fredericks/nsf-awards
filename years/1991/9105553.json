 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a model system to study organelle transport, pigment granule               aggregation and dispersion will be analyzed in lysed melanophores               from the teleost fish, Tilapia mossambica and Fundulus                          heteroclitus, and the movements of isolated granules along                      microtubules will be assessed in vitro.  The aim of the project is              to determine whether or not dynein and kinesin have opposing roles              in the generation of bidirectional pigment granule transport in                 melanophores and to understand the mechanism by which the two                   directions of transport are regulated.  This laboratory has                     previously determined that dispersion requires protein                          phosphorylation via cAMP dependent protein kinase while aggregation             requires protein dephosphorylation via calcineurin.  Experiments                will be carried out to determine if dynein, kinesin, or other                   components of the pigment granule transport system in the                       melanophores are substrates for the kinase and phosphatase.  If                 these substrates as well as the motors generating opposing                      movements are identified, then it may be possible to elucidate the              mechanism by which the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation signal             is translated into transport in a given direction.                                                                                                              The orderly transport of membrane-enclosed subcellular compartments             from one region of the cytoplasm to another is a very important                 problem in cell biology.  Such transport phenomena are responsible              for a wide variety of cellular functions, including endocytosis and             secretion.  In the case of melanophores of fish, the transport of               the pigment granules radially from an \"aggregated\" central location             to a \"dispersed\" situation results in a change in the coloration                of the skin of the fish, and is an important adaptive response to               predation.  This project will result in information that will be                of use in not only understanding fish coloration, but also all                  other microtubule-mediated translocations of subcellular                        compartments.",
