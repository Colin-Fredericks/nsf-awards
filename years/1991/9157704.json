 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic molecules with high-spin ground states will be prepared                 and studied as models for building ferromagetic organic materials.              Tetramethyleneallene (TMA) is one of the species that will be                   prepared and the electronic structure will be determined. This                  tetraradical can be viewed as a union of two planar pi-systems,                 each a trimethylenemethane triplet biradical, in an orthogonal                  arrangement. TMA is expected to display an extremely strong                     quintet spin preference, since it provides powerful exchange                    coupling of the orthogonal triplet trimethylenemethane subunits.                This concept will be tested experimentally. A second class of                   high-spin ground state compounds will be prepared and studied,                  which consist of two carbons in a trimethylenemethane biradical                 fused to an array of aromatic rings. These high-spin compounds                  will be characterized by cryogenic, matrix-isolation EPR and                    electronic spectroscopy. Another aspect of the research will                    employ photoacoustical calorimetry to acquire thermochemical data               on strained bridgehead olefins and imines via the enthalpies of                 their photochemical generation and subsequent reactions.                        %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research              of Professor Gary J. Snyder at the University of Chicago.                       Molecules in their lowest energy state ordinarily have all of                   their electron spins paired. A simplistic view is that electrons                normally travel in pairs, where one electron of the pair spins                  clockwise and the other spins counterclockwise. In this research                project, molecules will be prepared where the lowest energy state               has either two or four unpaired electrons. That is, electrons that              do not travel in pairs, which usually defines a higher energy                   state of a molecule. Specially designed molecules will be prepared              to have these so-called high-spin states and their electronic and               physical properties will be studied. This may be of practical                   importance to the preparation of organic ferromagnetic substances.",
