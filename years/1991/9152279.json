 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clear, unambiguous, \"real world\" physics laboratory experiences                 are crucial for the development of an appreciation and                          understanding of physics by the non-physics major.  Heidelberg                  College is addressing this need by developing laboratory                        experiences that utilize a \"video system\" (camcorder, jog and                   shuttle player, monitor and tripod).The equipment acquired with                 this grant is being used to conduct experiments in the areas of                 kinematics, dynamics, momentum, angular motion, and energy.                     These are areas which students have found difficult to                          visualize and understand.  The video equipment is providing                     students with tools to record the complex or short duration                     events common to these areas, and analyze the events step-by-                   step as the events progress in time.The power of the video                      system is that it aids students in observing and quantifying                    \"real world\" events that normally cannot be considered in the                   introductory laboratory because of size, spatial, and time                      limitations.  For non-physics majors, it is sometimes the first                 time they discover that physics exists outside of the                           laboratory.NSF funds are being matched with funds from non-                     federal sources.",
