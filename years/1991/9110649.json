 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are large reliable differences in probability judgments                   made by individuals in Western countries like the United States                 and those in numerous Asian countries. Most differences pertain                 to calibration.  (Good calibration exists, for example, if about                40% of the events that are assigned probability judgements of 40%               actually happen.)  However, differences in discrimination have been             documented too.  (Discrimination is the ability of judgements to                sharply distinguish instances when a target event will occur from               those when it will not.)  Several potential explanations of the                 observed differences are to be tested in experiments with subject               groups in the United States and a number of Asian locations.  One               hypothesis is that the effects are limited to judges' directly                  reported assessments, which are not their opinions.  Another claims             that the differences are restricted to a narrow class of events.                A third explanation says that they reflect societal differences in              the relative importance of various aspects of judgment quality.                 The hypothesis of primary interest asserts that the effects rest                on cognitive processing habits rooted in different educational                  practices.  The proposed studies promise insights about universal               judgment mechanisms as well as mechanisms peculiar to given                     cultures.  They should provide guidance about problems in cross-                national communication and cooperation and the transferability of               decision technologies.",
