 "awd_abstract_narration": "The staff of the Center for Multisensory Learning at the Lawrence               Hall of Science proposes a three-year primary school general                    science project, the Full Option Science System, Kindergarten                   through Grade Two Project (FOSS K-2).  The project will extend                  the existing FOSS 3-6 program down to the early childhood years.                FOSS K-2 activity development will be guided by the same                        philosophy and theory of cognitive development that was used                    successfully in the FOSS 3-6 project.  The result will be a                     collection of eight topical modules, featuring multi-sensory                    activities that are technically and developmentally appropriate                 for all youngsters in the grades for which they are suggested,                  and easy for typical teachers to use.                                                                                                                           The FOSS K-2 project will develop three major instructional                     products in conjunction with Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational               Corporation, two school districts (Vallejo and Mt. Diablo), and a               national network of test directors (10) and the schools with                    which they work.                                                                    1.  Eight teacher guides for the eight modules, including                   background, objectives, preparation, lesson plans, discussion                   questions, language and math extensions, and take-homes.                            2. Eight complete student equipment kits, attractively and                  efficiently packaged, including manipulatives, student sheets,                  and study posters.                                                                  3.  Study posters and science stories to be read to students.               Study-poster books and narrative stories will help students                     transfer the content of the activities to every-day situations.d                                                                                                Special attention will be directed to making the FOSS K-2                       activities exciting for teachers to use with students.  The end                 product will be a complete, developmentally sound K-6 program.",
