The organizer is Dr. P. Majumdar of the                       S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences in Culcutta.                       Topics will include 1.  Structure functions at low X,                           polarized structure functions, and higher order QCD                             contributions for jets, W, Z and heavy flavour production;                      2.  Low energy weak interactions (hedronic matrix elements,                     B- Physics); 3.  New particle search; and 4.  Electro -                         weak radiative corrections to electro - weak processes and                      2 W physics.  Participation will include scientists from                        India, the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Switzerland,                            Sweden, Japan, Austria, and Poland.  Much of the                                presentations will cover theoretical research, with                             experimental work contributed by four Indian and a number                       of European and U.S. scientists.  The meeting will include                      three days of presentations to be followed by one week of                       separate working groups on specific subtopics under group                       leaders.  The group leaders will present the results on the                     final day of the workshop.                                                                                                                                      Scope:  This is the second such workshop.  The first was                        held in January 1989 at Tata Institute of Fundamental                           Research in Bombay which resulted in proceedings published                      by World Scientific.  The two week intensive interaction                        between senior visiting scientists and young Indian                             scientists is expected to lead to emerging new ideas and                        new results for expanding the present knowledge of basic                        science.  It is also likey that future collaboration would                      result from this interaction.",
