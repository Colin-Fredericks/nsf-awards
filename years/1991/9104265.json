 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will investigate geometric                      structures on spaces but will focus much of the research on Mobius              structures. A Mobius structure on a space is a group action which               acts on the space and comes from the standard structure of                      conformal transformations of the sphere. In the two dimensional                 case a Mobius structure is equivalent to a one dimensional complex              projective structure. Professor Kulkarni will study three classes               of spaces with Mobius structure and attempt to understand the                   underlying geometry of these spaces.                                                 The theme of this research is to understand an abstract space              by placing additional structure on the space. One simple way of                 understanding this mathematical tool is to think of a simple closed             curve - perhaps twisted in some way. Now if one marks off equal                 distances on the curve thus creating a metric space, one can talk               about the relationship between points on the curve. Thus the curve              has been endowed with \"additional structure\". The principal                     investigator will attempt to do something like this but with a much             more complicated structure.",
