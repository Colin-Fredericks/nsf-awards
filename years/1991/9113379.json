 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although much of the basic research in geography and regional science        is conducted by faculty members in disciplinary-oriented departments            within colleges and universities, many faculty members in professional          planning schools also engage in high-quality basic research.  For               faculty in these programs, the annual meeting of the Association of             Collegiate Schools of Planning (ACSP) is one of the foremost settings at        which to hear the latest research results, plan future research and             educational collaborations, and discuss other matters of mutual                 interest.  In July 1991, the ACSP annual meeting will be held jointly           with the annual meeting of the Association of European Schools of               Planning (AOESP) in Oxford, England.  This meeting will be one of the           first opportunities for large-scale direct contact between Americans and        European with common planning-related research interests.  This proposal        provides group-travel support to enable at least eight women who hold           junior faculty positions at American universities to attend the joint           ACSP/AOESP meeting in Oxford.  All travel-grant recipients will be              required to seek out and explore possibilities for research                     collaboration with at least one European scholar.  Travel-grant                 recipients will report on their activities at the joint conference and          on their efforts to establish collaborations after the meeting.                 Recipients also will be required to secure matching funds to support            their attendance at the meeting.                                                   Through this award, American participation in this important                 international meeting will be expanded.  At least eight young women will        be given opportunities to broaden their exposure to current knowledge           and to expand their networks of international contacts.  Long-term              benefits of this activity ultimately will include development of                collaborative international research projects and stimulation of the            careers of productive young women scientists.",
