 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fabric (that is, the physical structure) of sand, and the                   effect of aging,                                                                play a fundamental role in determining the stresses necessary                   to trigger liquefaction under earthquake loading.  Recent                       observations indicate that changes in sand fabric, as                           measured in the field, may result in a rapid initial gain in                    stiffness due to aging, but that dynamic loads, such as those                   induced by earthquakes, cause this stiffness to degrade.  This                  results in significant fluctuations of the sand liquefaction                    resistance with time.  It is possible that both physical and                    chemical mechanisms may contribute to these age-related                         changes in liquefaction resistance.                                                                                                                             The basic intent of this research project is to investigate in                  the laboratory whether beneficial ageing effects on soil fabric                 can be destroyed by relatively low levels of cyclic strain,                     thereby simulating the effects of earthquakes which are                         smaller, but more frequent, than the \"design earthquake\" for                    a given site.  The goal is to investigate the earthquake-                       induced reversibility of the effects of time on sand fabric,                    thereby concluding whether it is a matter of practical                          concern in evaluating the liquefaction potential of a given                     site.  If this turns out to be the case, it will bring into                     question the way in which penetrometer-based design                             methods are currently applied, and will further suggest that a                  conservative design approach may be to base the                                 liquefaction potential evaluation on the resistance of the                      sand in a freshly-deposited state in the laboratory.",
