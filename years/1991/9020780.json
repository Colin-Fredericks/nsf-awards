 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Jeremy Bruenn,                       Department of Biological Sciences, State University of New                      York (SUNY) at Buffalo, to pursue with Dr. Hyun Sam Kang,                       Director, Institute for Molecular Biology  and Genetics,                        Seoul National University, for a period of 24 months, a                         program of cooperative research on cis-acting sites in the                      yeast viral double-stranded RNA's.  This research will                          address current problems involving the interaction of                           proteins and nucleic acids.  The collaborators will undertake                   a fine-structure mapping of the recognition  sites on the                       viral plus strand for viral proteins.  This will be                             accomplished by RNase protection experiments and by in vitro                    mutagenesis  of cDNA clones of relevant regions and their                       expression both in vivo and  in vitro.                                                                                                                          Viruses provide a convenient means of addressing some of the                    problems involving the interactions of proteins and nucleic                     acids.  In particular, viruses with their own packaged                          polymerases provide self-contained systems in which the                         interaction of both enzymatic and structural proteins with                      nucleic acids can be studied in an easily purified and                          isolated form.  The ScV, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus                      provides an opportunity to study these interactions and                         protein interaction with double stranded RNA's (dsRNA's) as                     well.  The U.S. and Korean collaborators are highly respected                   scientists who not only have extensive individual research                      records but also a record of successful collaboration in the                    field of the proposal.  This project is relevant to  the                        objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                        which seeks  to increase the level of cooperation between                       U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange                   of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and                    through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean                    participation in the project is supported by the Korea                          Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
