 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Tien Wu of Ohio State University and Dr. A. Watson of the New                   Zealand Forest Research Institute. The principle objective of                   the project is to establish realistic models of root geometry                   and soil-root interaction that can be used in analyses and                      evaluation of vegetation roots as soil reinforcement for                        civil engineering construction projects. Data collected by                      the New Zealand Forest Research Institute will be used as the                   basis for the model. With this data, a two-dimensional soil-                    root interaction model will be extended into three dimensions.                  In-situ tests on root systems of Pinus radiata will be                          performed in New Zealand, and the results used to verify the                    model. The stochastic nature of root geometry and soil-root                     interaction will be accounted for in the model. The mean and                    variance of root and soil properties, generated by the model,                   will be used to evaluate the mean and variance of the                           estimated performance of the system in soil reinforcement.                                                                                                      The project represents excellent collaboration in combining                     the models developed by Wu with the existing data base and                      expertise in field studies available at the New Zealand                         Forest Research Institute. This is important fundamental work                   in advancing soil-root interaction models, as well as                           havingpotential for contributing to the solution of slope                       stability problems of major concern in such civil engineering                   projects as watershed management and land use planning.",
