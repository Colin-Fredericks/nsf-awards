The hosting society is the                   Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.  Other                          participating societies are Gesellschaft fuer Angewandte                        Mathematik und Mechanik (Germany), Institute of Mathematics and                 Its Applications (United Kingdom), Italiana di Matematica                       Applicata e Industriale (Italy), and Societe de Mathematiques                   Appliquees et Industrielles (France).  There is the expectation                 that over 1800 mathematical scientist, computer scientist,                      engineers and other scientist from over 50 countries will attend                this research conference.                                                            Scientific topics will include fluid dynamics, solid                       mechanics, materials science, geophysics, thermodynamics,                       electrodynamics, number analysis, large-scale modeling, parallel                processing, symbolic computation, linear programming, dynamical                 systems, computer science, discrete mathematics, signal                         processing, control theory, robotics, semiconductor design, and                 applied probability and statistics.  This conference will provide               U.S. investigators with access to developing international                      technology in computers, algorithms, and mathematics.  In                       addition to the National Science Foundation, this conference is                 supported by industrial sponsors, the Air Force Office of                       Scientific Research, the Department of Energy, and the Office of                Naval Research.",
