 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator intends to study questions involving the                  symmetry properties of manifolds and the existence of riemannian                metrics with weak curvature properties on manifolds.  The                       symmetry investigations will include questions about low-                       dimensional manifolds and the applications of surgery theory and                homotopy theory to problems involving higher-dimensional                        manifolds; much of the latter will involve symmetries whose                     singular sets have relatively large dimension and comparing the                 possible classifications of such actions with cases where the                   singular set dimension is relatively small.  All these problems                 will be studied by a combination of methods from algebraic and                  geometric topology, with input from stable and unstable homotopy                theory, the theory of surgery on manifolds, topological and                     differentiable transformation groups, and low-dimensional                       topological methods, including gauge theory.  The objective of                  the work is an improved understanding of some questions about the               existence of positively curved metrics and the existence and                    classification of certain symmetries; these questions have                      generally arisen in connection with recent advances in geometric                topology.                                                                            Manifolds are ubiquitons in mathematics, arising naturally                 as the solutions of systems of equations in higher dimensional                  spaces.  As to low-dimensional manifolds, we live in one,                       three-dimensional or four-dimensional, depending on whether the                 time dimension is considered as well as the three space                         dimensions.  More information about symmetries of manifolds,                    their curvature, and other properties is thus bound to be useful.                                                                                                                                           //",
