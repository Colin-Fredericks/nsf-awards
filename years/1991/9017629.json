 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will develop a generalized three-dimensional model               for the interaction of normal and strike-slip faults during                     continental extension.  The relationship between transverse                     structures (strike-slip faults) and detachment (normal) faults in               southern Nevada will be examined in detail, and a temporal and                  structural history will be established.  To accomplish this, an                 integrated study will be conducted that involves geologic mapping,              geochronology, and seismic reflection profiling across both                     detachment and strike-slip faults.  This is a collaborative                     proposal with 9018301 which will concentrate on the seismic                     aspects.  Three classes of models will be tested:  strike-slip                  faults ar crust-penetrating, fundamental first order structures and             normal faults are secondary; detachment faults are first-order                  structures  and strike-slip faults are secondary transfer faults                in the shallow crust; and, strike-slip and normal faults are                    synchronous and allow extension to occur by the horizontal                      translation of crustal blocks.  The results of this study will                  provide fundamental three-dimensional information on the mechanisms             by which continental crust may extend, and as such have                         wide-reaching tectonic importance.",
