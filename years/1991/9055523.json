Each                   summer 20 teachers in science and 20 teachers in mathematics will               attend a six-week summer workshop and participate in an academic                year follow-up.  A coordinated workshop for 12 principals will                  also be included.  The science teachers will study biology and                  physical science with an emphasis on using microcomputers to                    increase learning.  The mathematics teachers will learn                         techniques of teaching problem solving and application of                       microcomputers in geometry and algebra.  Both groups of teachers                will learn techniques for instructional improvement particularly                those which are effective with minority students.  The follow-up                activities include classroom visits by SIUE faculty and meeting                 with teachers in the summer once a month throughout the academic                year.                                                                                                                                                           The matching funds from SIUE and the target schools is 31% of the               NSF award",
