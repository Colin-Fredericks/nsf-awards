 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biology at Grinnell College is in the process                 of revising its sophomore-level core course in Cell Biology. In                 the past the laboratory consisted of a series of independent                    exercises where important techniques were learned but the                       experience was not unified in any way. We propose development                   of a series of sequential experiments unified around the study                  of cellular structure and function, made possible by                            fractionation of organelles. Laboratories are planned to                        prepare organelles from plant and animal tissues for the study                  of the activities of selected organelles such as oxygen                         consumption by isolated mitochondria, electron flow in isolated                 chloroplasts, kinetic studies of marker enzymes for different                   cellular fractions, organization, and protein diversity in                      differentiated tissues.  All equipment necessary for these                      laboratories is available with the exception of an                              ultracentrifuge and rotors. We also propose updated experiments                 in four upper-level courses where ultracentrifugation will be                   necessary for preparation of fractions for the study of plasma                  membrane function, plasmid isolation, purification of virus                     particles and examination of fractions by electron microscopy.                  The addition of an ultracentrifuge will make it possible for                    the department to broaden the firsthand experience of students                  with modern biological instrumentation.",
