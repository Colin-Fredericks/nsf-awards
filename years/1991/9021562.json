 "awd_abstract_narration": "What are the mechanisms that mediate the experience of time in                  humans and other animals?  Killeen and Fetterman (1988) argued                  that animals base temporal judgments on behaviors elicited by                   periodic reinforcements, and that the frequency of reinforcement                determines the speed of a pacemaker whose pulses instigate                      transitions from one behavior to another.  This research will                   evaluate the adequacy of that Behavioral Theory of timing, and                  will compare its predictions against those of an information-                   processing theory of animal timing (Scalar Expectancy Theory).                                                                                                  Behavioral Theory predicts a correlation between temporal                       judgments and ongoing behavior, and thus Dr. Fetterman will                     observe animals as they time the duration of events.  Temporal                  judgments should be better predicted by the ongoing behavior than               by the time elapsed.  Dr. Fetterman will also disrupt ongoing                   behavior, which should produce a decrease in the accuracy of                    timing.  Other experiments concern the statistical properties of                the pacemaker and the relation between the speed of the                         pacemaker, arousal, and ensuing temporal judgments.  Behavioral                 Theory holds that a given interval of time is always evaluated                  relative to the prevailing level of arousal; changes in arousal                 should cause changes in the perceived duration of events.                       Several experiments will incorporate manipulations that should                  alter level of arousal (e.g., by changing rate of reinforcement),               and thus should perturb the animal's sense of time.  These                      findings may be related to the human literature on disturbances                 in biorhythmicity and to disorders that involve a distortion of                 time perspective.",
