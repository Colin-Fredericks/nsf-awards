In the past,                  these needs have been met by each Agency individually, through                  individual procurements of low-speed (9600 to 56,000 baud),                     typically satellite, circuits between networks at affected sites on             either side of the Atlantic.                                                         Substantial economies of scale exist in the telecommunications             industry.  Through discussions leading to mutual agreements, the                agencies are able to meet all their needs for US-UK computer                    connectivity by sharing a single fractional-T1 (512 kb/s)                       fiber-optic circuit.  DARPA have agreed to act as the agent for                 procuring the circuit; the purpose of this project is to compensate             DARPA for NSF's agreed-to share of the cost.",
