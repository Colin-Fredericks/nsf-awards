 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central equatorial Pacific is an extensive region of high                   nutrient upwelling, enhanced primary productivity, and elevated                 plankton concentrations that is of special interest to the Joint                Global Ocean Flux Studies (JGOFS) because it may account for 20                 to 50% of the estimated global rate of carbon export to the deep                sea. The general goal of this research is to contribute to                      understanding the relationships among primary production, food-                 web structure, and biogeochemical cycling and fluxes in this                    region as a component of the JGOFS Equatorial Pacific Program.                  The research utilizes a complementary set of experimental                       approaches (fluorescently-labelled prey particles, metabolic                    inhibitors, and seawater dilution) and flow cytometry techniques                to identify major microconsumer groups and to measure their                     grazing rates, behaviors, and community impacts at different                    temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, the research will 1)                 determine the distributions, abundances, and biomass of pico- and               nanoplankton communities and their variations with depth and                    latitude on cross-equatorial transects, 2) identify and quantify                the dominant microzooplankton grazers on pico- and nanoplankton                 communities, 3) determine the grazing impact of microzooplankton                on component populations of bacteria, prochlorophytes,                          cyanobacteria, and algae as functions of depth, time of day, and                trophic state, 4) evaluate the hypothesis that there is  a                      general size relationship linking the rates of grazing impact on                picoplankton  populations, and test the hypotheses that the role                of mixotrophy among planktonic flagellates will increase along                  environmental gradients from eutrophic (nutrient-rich) to                       oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) systems and at low light levels in                 the euphotic zone.",
