 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his study of non-                 self-dual Yang-Mills connections. The existence of these                        connections on any bundle satisfying a topological condition was                recently proved by Sadun and the principal investigator. He will                now use algebraic and analytic methods to attempt to obtain                     additional topological and geometric information. Spectacular                   geometric results about four-dimensional manifolds were obtained                from a study of the self-dual Yang-Mills moduli spaces and it is                hoped that equally important breakthroughs will result from a study             of the non-self-dual case.                                                           The Yang-Mills equations were first studied by physicists in               an attempt to create a unified field theory. Deep mathematical                  techniques were needed to analyze these equations and it soon                   became apparent that this area of mathematical physics possessed a              fascinating algebraic and geometric structure. The field has                    developed to become one which is important both to physics and                  mathematics and in which ideas from each discipline contribute to               the other.",
