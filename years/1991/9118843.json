 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. W. Wayt Thomas is a Curator at the New York Botanical                  Garden, and he has organized an ambitious two-year planning                     activity involving a Consortium of eight of the largest free-                   standing (i.e., non-University, non-Federal) natural history                    museums and botanical gardens in the U.S.:  the American Museum                 of Natural History (New York), the New York Botanical Garden, the               Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Carnegie Museum                of Natural History (Pittsburgh), the Missouri Botanical Gardens                 (St. Louis), the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History,                  the Bernice P. Bishop Museum of Natural History (Honolulu), and                 the California Academy of Sciences (San Francisco).  The Field                  Museum of Natural History (Chicago) and the Smithsonian's Museum                of Natural History are ex officio members of the Consortium.  The               Consortium proposes to engage the Mitre Corporation as an                       independent consultant for analysis of the data management needs                in each of the eight member museums, and for recommendations                    concerning hardware architecture and approaches to system                       software.  These needs would include databases of specimens, and                institutions, and general interoperability with the biological                  research community.  The results of the needs assessment and the                recommendations for system design would then be used in future                  proposals for large-scale computing hardware.                                        Each of the Consortium  museums has initiated creation of                  computer databases for their specimen holdings, and the research                community will increasingly expect access the these data in                     easiest possible way.  This collective planning activity will                   highlight common needs and solutions that could be shared among                 institutions, thereby ending the tendency for the museums to                    diverge in their data management practices, and increasing the                  level of interoperability among the nation's biodiversity                       reference collections.  The creation of the Consortium and the                  results of this project will provide benefits to the entire                     biological research community by coordinating the management of                 data used by diverse scientific disciplines.",
