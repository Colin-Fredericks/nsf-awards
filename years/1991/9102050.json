 "awd_abstract_narration": "The innovations expected during the efforts carried out in                 this project relate primarily to the integration of expert system               technology into mechanical design and finite element analysis.  The             resulting software will provide an efficient three-dimensional                  design tool that will make expert skills available to the novice                user without requiring an exhaustive background in the finite                   element theory and terminology.  This availability is likely to                 reduce design time and productivity.  The design-representation                 system (DRS) will represent the design in a format that may be                  addressed by a variety of other applications.  Feature-based design             is gaining popularity and the intended generality of the DRS will               represent an advance in this domain.                                                 This project presents some challenging obstacles that will                 need to be overcome during its implementation.  The application of              expert system technology to mechanical engineering is a relatively              new field of research, and there is little prior work in this area.             It is expected that the research will capture the qualitative                   nature of analysis practices in the form of an integrated kilobyte              and also improve the capabilities of computer-aided design via                  artificial intelligence techniques.",
