 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California at Irvine and the University of               California at Santa Barbara propose to establish an NSF                         Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for High-Speed                  Image/Signal Processing.  The Center will focus on fundamental                  approaches to high-speed computation and will include the                       development of algorithm, computer software, computer                           architectures, and electronic circuits for industrial applications.             The Center will initially cover six principal research areas: 1)                Digital Signal Processing Algorithms, 2) Parallel Architecture, 3)              Pattern Recognition and Image Understanding, 4) Automatic Circuit               Design, 5) Image Formation and Sensors, and 6) Robotic                          applications.  The Center plans to support industries in several                areas including Robotics and Automation, Non-destructive                        Evaluation, Remote Sensing, Medical imaging etc.  Both the                      University of California at Irvine and the University of California             at Santa Barbara have an outstanding research record in high-speed              image/signal processing and the combined resources of the two                   universities will provide an outstanding interdisciplinary                      environment to attack the problems that will be addressed by the                Center.                                                                              The Program Manager recommends $100,000 for the first year of              a five-year continuing award to be divided equally between the two              universities participating in the Center.                                            Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                   and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review             the progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the               following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                     interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to                  which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                  robust research program is developing. If the review is                         satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support of the                 next period of this continuing award.",
