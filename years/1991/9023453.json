 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers recognizes               the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching and                        scholarship, as well as potential for continued significant                     contributions to scientific research, the academic profession,                  and the education of future scientists and engineers. Dr.                       Williams's research under this award is in morphological aspects                of solid surfaces.                                                                   The morphology of solid surfaces, e.g., their structure on a               scale of nanometers to microns, is the governing factor in a                    range of practical processes including crystal growth, epitaxy                  and etching. To understand these processes, it is first necessary               to understand both the thermodynamics and kinetics of surface                   morphology, which are in turn governed by the behavior of surface               steps. Direct measurements of step behavior, designed to allow                  quantitative analysis in terms of statistical mechanical                        predictions, will be performed using diffraction and imaging                    techniques.  This grant will be used to foster excellence in this               research by supporting: 1) development and application of state-                of-the-art experimental capabilities to allow measurements in                   previously unexplored areas, and 2) direct interaction with                     theorists to insure that experiments are relevant to outstanding                questions of theory.                                                                 Within the broad criteria listed above, the systems to be                  studied will be chosen to have practical materials significance.                Examples of relevant problems are the formation of quantum wires,               the oxidative etching of Si, and the faceting of metals surfaces                under adsorption of chemical reactants.",
