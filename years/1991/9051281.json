 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to expose undergraduate civil                       engineering students to the wide variety of field test equipment                they will be encountering in geotechnical engineering practice.                 This training has not traditionally been included as part of the                undergraduate curricula at most universities, yet field testing                 has as the primary design tools for geotechnical engineering                    firms.  Current industry needs are therefore dictating a change                 in the focus of undergraduate civil engineering education.  This                change includes a greater emphasis on interdisciplinary testing                 techniques.  Engineers are relying on geological and geophysical                methods in conjunction with geotechnical field test to conduct                  engineering surveys and determine design parameters.  The                       equipment was selected in an effort to expose students to some                  other tools most widely used in current practice:  a nuclear                    density device, a dilatometer, and geophysical equipment                        (seismograph, resistivity meter and magnetometer).  Approximately               170 students per year will become acquainted with these new tools               through field exercises incorporated into three undergraduate                   civil engineering courses.",
