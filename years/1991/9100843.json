 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses time series analysis on a national sample                of employed adults to assess differing explanations for the                     increasing inequality of incomes.   Human capital and status                    attainment explanations focus on characteristics of individuals                 such as their education.  This project compares those perspec-                  tives to effects produced by changes in the structure of jobs                   (e.g., movement towards a U.S. service economy, and movement of                 manufacturing to other countries) and wages (e.g., rapid creation               of low-wage jobs).  PI anticipates finding important, perhaps                   primary, effects of these structural changes.  The project                      permits comparing predictions of all three perspectives.  Out-                  comes of the research will contribute to sociological and econo-                mic analysis of changes in income distribution.  Applications of                the information would include design of intervention programs                   either at the individual (e.g., training programs) or the struc-                tural (e.g., international trade laws) levels. //",
