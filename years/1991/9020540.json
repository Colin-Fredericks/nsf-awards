The                 conference is expected to draw between 300 and 350 participants and             will focus, through eight scientific sessions, on the forefront of              research into the genetics, molecular genetics, and molecular                   biology of the filamentous fungi.  Twenty-three speakers have been              invited to speak on their research and approximately twice this                 many will be chosen for shorter presentations at a time closer to               the conference.  All seven session chairpersons, and all invited                speakers have been confirmed.  Special effort has been made both                to identify younger scientists whose efforts warrant exposure, and              to encourage participation in the conference by students.  At the               time of the meeting, all participants will be encourage to                      participate in one of three poster sessions.",
