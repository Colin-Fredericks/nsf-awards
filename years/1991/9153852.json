 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clemson University Foundation will conduct a four-year                          program to develop materials that can be used to train AP                       calculus teachers and to help them successfully implement                       the use of graphing calculators in their calculus                               instruction.  Four sets of materials will be developed: a)                      a set of references, b) a set of workshop materials, c) a                       set of instructional examples, and d) a set of prototypic                       test items.  Criteria for which areas of calculus materials                     will be developed are the importance of the calculus                            concepts in the AP calculus syllabus, instruction of the                        concepts may be significantly changed when graphing                             calculators are used, and the set of currently available                        reference materials does not sufficiently explore the use                       of graphing calculators in teaching the concepts.                                                                                                               Clemson University, as the site of the AP Calculus reading,                     will use the materials developed to create a cadre of 350                       high school and college mathematics teachers, themselves AP                     calculus readers, who will be trained and well-equipped as                      a national team of AP Calculus workshop leaders.  The                           training will consist of 9 days of summer institutes held                       over the four year period.  It is anticipated that in the                       next four years, these workshops leaders will deliver over                      a thousand workshops for approximately twenty                                   thousand second-wave calculus teachers.  The emphasis is on                     the implementation of the graphing calculator in calculus                       curriculum because the AP Calculus Committee of the College                     Board has issued policy statements to the effect that                           beginning in May 1993 (May 1995), both the Calculus AB and                      Calculus BC examinations will contain questions for which a                     scientific (graphing) calculator is necessary of                                advantageous.                                                                                                                                                   Clemson University, the College Board, Educational Testing                      Service, Hewlett Packard, and Texas Instruments                                 cost-sharing account for 119% of the NSF budget.                                                                                                                The project has the potential for improving the conceptual                      and problem-solving content of existing high school                             calculus courses through enhancing calculus teachers'                           capacities to incorporate computing technologies into their                     courses.  If any institution can have an impact on                              introducing technology into the teaching of secondary                           school calculus, it may well be the College Board.  And                         Dr. Kenelly's connections with the AP Program and his long                      experience with the College Board are key strengths of this                     proposal.",
