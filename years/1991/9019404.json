 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several types of gelatinous zooplankton, including medusae,                     sometimes occur in extremely high numbers (blooms).  The                        reasons for dramatic population fluctuations are not                            understood.  The scyphomedusa Chrysaora quinquecirrha is                        unusual in thriving in estuarine waters of as little as 7%                      salinity.  However, its annual population fluctuations may be                   related to differences in springtime conditions during asexual                  production of medusae in the spring.  This research is                          designed to test the combined effects of temperature, salinity,                 and food levels on the production and survival of young                         medusae.  Drs. Purcell and Wright will examine ionic and osmotic                regulation in the polyps and medusae in order to determine if                   they are physiologically limited in low salinities.  This project               is an effort to understand population fluctuations of a major                   predator in Chesapeake Bay.  The results are important in                       understanding the formation of blooms in pelagic ecosystems.                    Responses of bloom organisms to changing environmental                          conditions are of particular importance now, given the                          predicted temperature and salinity changes associated with                      global warming.",
