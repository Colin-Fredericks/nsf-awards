The subject matter for both workshops will be                                   approximately the same.  The specific content of the                            second workshop will be based on the results of the first                       workshop and the need to fulfill the objectives of the                          project.                                                                                                                                                        A steering Committee representing the United States and                         Argentina will select a maximum of eight participants for                       each workshop.  Each workshop will last three days in                           which preliminary papers will be presented; relevant                            research needs and opportunities will be discussed; and                         future collaboration will be planned.  A fourth day will                        be available for visiting a few local facilities and                            laboratories related to the Workshop topics.                                                                                                                    The objective is to enable the United States and Argentina                      to gain mutually from collaborative discussion of common                        research needs in developing coastal ocean space and how                        best to approach them.",
