 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major function of the brain is to initiate and direct an                      individual's behaviors.  While behaviors are controlled by                      dispersed groups of highly intertwined neurons, the particular                  neurons responsible for particular behaviors have not been                      identified.  This problem remains unsolved simply because there                 are so many neurons and their possible interconnections are so                  complex that the task seems Herculean.  Dr. Coquelin's aim is to                unravel this tangle by capitalizing on some recent advances in                  the fields of behavioral genetics and developmental biology.  He                has selected two different strains of inbred mice that differ in                their expression of some specific hormonally induced behaviors.                 Dr. Coquelin will combine very young embryos from these two                     different inbred strains.  The offspring, referred to as                        chimeras, will possess a mosaic of cells in all tissues,                        including the brain.  When they mature, the mice will perform the               kind of behavior according to the type of neurons which were                    inherited from the particular genetic strain.  The origin of                    these neurons will be identified by immunocytochemical                          procedures.  Thus, generating chimeras will enable him to                       identify the sets of neurons which are responsible for some                     genetically determined hormone-regulated behaviors.  Such                       information eventually will help us locate and fix behavioral                   abnormalities which may arise congenitally, from disease, or                    accidentally.",
