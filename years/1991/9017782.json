 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adhesion of cells within tissues is a basic cellular process that               is common to all multicellular organisms. Dr. Loomis is focusing                his attention on the mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion in                        Dictyostelium that function during aggregation and subsequent                   morphogenesis. He has shown that a surface glycoprotein, gp24, is               synthesized during the first few hours of development. Antibodies               specific to gp24 block adhesion during this period and this                     activity can be neutralized by highly purified gp24. A cloned                   protein of the gene coding for gp24 was ligated downstream to an                actin promoter such that antisense RNA would be generated. Both                 synthesis of gp24 and the acquisition of cell-cell adhesion is                  delayed about four hours in cell transformed with this vector.                  Dr. Loomis proposes to delete the pair of genes coding for gp24                 by gene replacement in both wild type strains and in strains                    specifically lacking the second adhesion mechanism (contact sites               A). The consequences of a complete lack of gp24 throughout                      development will be fully determined with respect to                            morphogenesis and subsequent developmental gene expression.                     Following aggregation another adhesion mechanism appears in                     prespore cells that can be distinguished from the first two                     mechanisms by the adhesion blocking activity of specific                        antisera. Dr. Loomis proposes to fully characterize the essential               component(s) of the third adhesion mechanism.",
