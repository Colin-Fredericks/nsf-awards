 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is adding a solid-state photon detector-system to                  an existing nuclear laboratory course reguired for senior                       physics majors. Reasons for integrating this instrument into                    the senior course are:(1)  It is now a widely used and often                    preferred photon detector because of its good energy resolution                 and affordable cost.  (2)  It enables the students to learn the                 technigue of \"Proton Induced X-ray Emission\" (PIXE) for non-                    destructive trace element detection.  This technique                            supplements Rutherford backscattering (RBS) and Neutron                         Activation Analysis (NAA) another two important non-destructive                 analytical techniques which are already taught in the course.                   (3)  Together with the existing Nal(Tl) photon detection                        system, it allows the students to learn the technique of                        determining the absolute activity of a radioactive source by                    gamma-gamma coincidence measurement.  (4)  Students learn to                    use fast-timing electronics and coincidence techniques, and to                  program PC-based multichannel analyzers.  The addition of the                   proposed equipment makes this course essentially complete for                   learning radiation measurement techniques and introductory                      applied nuclear technologies.  NSF grant funds are being                        matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
