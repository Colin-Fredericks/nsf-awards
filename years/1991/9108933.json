Before full                                                      exploitation of the HTS's, their                                                current and power handling                                                      capacities need to be assessed.                                                 Knowing the material critical                                                   current density does not directly                                               lead to the maximum current that can                                            be carried by the transmission line.                                            In this Research Initiation Award,                                              London's equations and the two-fluid                                            model will be used to investigate                                               the current distributions on HTS                                                transmission lines.  They will be                                               coupled with one of two                                                         electromagnetic models.  The first                                              on is a full-wave analysis.  The                                                developed equations are discretized                                             over the structure cross-section in                                             a two dimensional mesh using the                                                finite-difference scheme.  The total                                            current carried by an HTS microstrip                                            line without exceeding the critical                                             current density of the material as                                              well as the total power can be                                                  calculated.  The losses due to                                                  normal electrons and the Q-factor                                               are directly obtained.  We have                                                 already performed initial                                                       calculations, and the preliminary                                               results are very encouraging.  We                                               here propose to fully develop the                                               model by incorporating substrate                                                losses and non-linear conductivity.                                             Then, the fully developed models                                                will be used for comprehensive                                                  analysis of HTS microstrip lines.                                               Design guidelines for microwave                                                 superconducting planar transmission                                             lines will be developed.                                                        Comparative study between different                                             planar transmission lines will be                                               performed to select the best                                                    structure that fully exploits HTS                                               capabilities.",
