Students will select a faculty mentor and pursue a research topic within        the problem area being investigated by that team.  This mini-project            forms the basis for an end-of-session report at a poster symposium.                                                                                             The poster will be taken back to the student's home school and will be          the basis for continued interaction between the student, the school, and        the College.  Participants will also attend weekly seminars and                 discussion groups on scientific philosophy, methodology, ethics, and            careers.  Each student will be given individualized attention by college        advisors and by career exploration personnel.",
