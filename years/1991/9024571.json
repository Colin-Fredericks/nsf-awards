The results of this                    research will provide new information about the reactions and                   properties of carbon-centered singlet biradical intermediates.                  These intermediates are produced in certain photolysis reactions                and have unbonded electrons on carbon atoms that are separated by                                                                                               carbon chains of varying lengths. Singlet biradicals have the                   unbonded electrons paired, the spin array found in bonds between                atoms. These intermediates have generated considerable interest                 recently. Comparisons will be made between experimental results                 and theory derived from molecular orbital calculations.                                                                                                         Singlet biradicals will be generated by picosecond flash laser                  photolysis techniques from a variety of precursors, including                   cyclic and bicyclic azo compounds, cyclic and bicyclic                          hydrocarbons, cyclic sulfides, and acyclic difunctional                         precursors. Properties and reactions of these biradicals will be                studied. The results of  molecular orbital calculations will be                 used with canonical variational transition state theory to                      determine the reaction path in the decomposition of biradicals. A                                                                                               goal in these calculations is to explore the unusual role of                    entropy in the dynamics of singlet biradicals.",
