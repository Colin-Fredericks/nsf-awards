 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the area of manufacturing processes to                  develop a long-term research collaboration between the University               and a leading United States printer and manufacturer of printing                equipment.  The training part of the project is aimed at                        acquiring an in-dept knowledge of heat-set web offset lithography               and the scientific and engineering issues involved in the design                and manufacture of printing equipment, in particular ovens and                  chill roll stands.  In the second phase of the project                          preliminary research will be initiated with the goal                            characterizing the process parameters.  This work will attempt to               understand the complex heating and cooling processes in the web                 as well as the stability of web motion as it moves through the                  press.                                                                               The ultimate goal is to identify the key scientific problems               that need to be solved in order to alleviate the condensate                     streaking problem that currently limits high quality high speed                 printing.  On site experiments will be explored under realistic                 press operating conditions to acquire a basic understanding of                  the dynamic flow of heat, moisture and solvent in the web as well               as to verify preliminary modelling efforts.",
