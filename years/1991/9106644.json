 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is some amount of variation in almost every trait in every                species that exists, and part of the cause of this variation is                 genetic.  The well known forces of directional selection and                    genetic drift both act to reduce variation, so its maintenance is               difficult to explain, and has been a long standing problem.  The                small marine crustacean, Paracercus sculpta has three different                 genetically based male body forms, which affect their ability to                attract and mate with females.  The proposed research will                      capitalize on this system to first identify the precise mode of                 inheritance, then describe how the environment influences the                   expression of the genotypes responsible for the different forms,                and lastly attempt to account for the evolutionary forces that                  allow the three morphs to coexist.  This system is uniquely                     suited to address these important questions, because the                        genotypes and the environments are easily manipulated, and the                  organism has a short generation time so that experiments can be                 done quickly.  Furthermore, the answers should have broad                       generality for explaining the ubiquitous variation in nature.//",
