 "awd_abstract_narration": "G proteins are signal transducers found in a variety of eukaryotic              organisms, from humans to fruit flies, and from slime molds to                  yeasts; they are heterotrimers (of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits)             that play crucial roles in many types of receptor-mediated                      signalling processes.  In plants, cells respond to a variety of                 hormonal and environmental stimuli; many of these are known or                  thought to involve receptors.  However, the function of G proteins              in plant signal transduction processes has not been demonstrated.               This laboratory has recently isolated a gene (GPA1) coding for a                G protein alpha subunit (G alpha 1) from the small flowering plant,             Arabidopsis thaliana.  This is the first G protein gene identified              in any plant.  The long term goal of this laboratory is to study                signal transduction processes in plants which require G protein                 functions, and to compare and contrast G protein functions between              animals, plants and simple eukaryotes.  The immediate objective                 proposed is to characterize the GPA1 gene and its product G alpha               1 in detail.  The time and tissue specific patterns of GPA1                     expression, the intracellular localization of the G alpha 1                     protein, and the function of G alpha 1 in the plant will be                     examined.  A wide range of approaches will be taken; they include               transcriptional and translational gene fusions, transgenic plants,              analysis using antibodies, and mutational analysis.                                                                                                             G proteins are known to be very important in animals and simple                 eukaryotes.  They are necessary for a variety of cellular                       signalling processes such as hormonal stimulation, photoreception               by cells of the retina, chemotaxis of slime molds during                        aggregation, and the yeast mating response.  There is evidence that             some plant signal transduction processes also require G proteins,               although, thus far, very little is known about this in plants.                  This laboratory has recently shown that G proteins are present in               plants by cloning a gene for a G protein subunit.  Understanding                the functions of G proteins in plants will be an important                      contribution to our knowledge of cellular signal transduction                   processes in plants.",
