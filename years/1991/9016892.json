 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for funds to purchase a freeze fracture                      instrument and a high pressure freezer.  The freeze fracture                    machine is required for determination of: (1) typed and                         distribution of proteins in membranes; (2) patterns of vesicle                  fusion; (3) relationships between extracellular matrix                          components; and (4) the role of non-bilayer lipids in membrane                  function.  The research proposed includes analysis of natural and               artificial membranes, comparison of control and experimental                    samples, and investigation of plants and protists.  (Minor users                will also examine fungi, animals, and DNA molecules.)  Freeze                   fracture, which involves cleaving and replicating cells and                     membranes, is the only technique that allows structural                         observation of intramembrane proteins and lipid phases.                         Therefore, it is absolutely required for this research.                                                                                                         If freeze fracture micrographs are to be meaningfully                           interpreted, it is best for the sample to be uncryoprotected, but               frozen so fast that vitrification occurs before the formation of                large ice crystals that destroy ultrastructure.  The high                       pressure freezer, which briefly applies pressure and cryogen                    together to lower the rate of freezing required to avoid ice                    crystal formation, is the only instrument that will allow good                  freezing to occur below the surface layer of an uncryoprotected                 sample.  Therefore, it greatly reduces artifacts, enhances                      meaningful interpretation of replicas, and increases the                        efficiency of freeze fracture experimentation.",
