The award permits undergraduate students to participate in a                    research program in the materials field under the supervision of                faculty members actively engaged in research.  Eight                            undergraduate students are being recruited from physics                         departments in the Southwest United States, with at least three                 of the openings being reserved for qualified women, handicapped,                and minority students.  Students will participate in a summer                   program that involves them in research associated with a faculty                member on laser-host materials, electro-optic, photorefractive                  and colloidal materials with potential for application in optical               systems.  The nine areas of this research include crystal growth,               time-resolved site-selection spectroscopy, optical instabilities,               optical characterization of quantum wells and superlattices,                    characterization of defect states in compound semiconductors,                   thermal transport in optical materials, complex fluids, and                     colloidal physics and optical filters.  Students will present the               results of their research in university seminars and at national                professional society meetings.  The program enhances current                    research activities as well as adding to the number of                          scientifically trained individuals.  It is hoped that this hands-               on experience will serve as a stimulus to attract and retain                    highly-gifted students into careers in teaching and research.",
