 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oxidation free-radical cyclization, in which the initial                        radical is generated oxidatively and/or the cyclic radical is                   oxidized to terminate the reaction, has considerable synthetic                  potential since more highly functionalized products can be                      prepared from simpler precursors than with the standard tin                     hydride reductive radical cyclizations.  This research consists                 of several interrelated studies developing new synthetic                        methods based on, and examining the mechanism of, oxidative                     free-radical cyclization using Mn(III), Cu(II) or Ce(IV) as the                 oxidant, and several natural product syntheses designed to                      exploit and develop oxidative free-radical cyclization.  In the                 area of methods development it is planned to examine: (1)                       addition to alkynes, solvent effects, (2) use of haloalkenes to                 control the regiochemistry of the cyclization, (3) new                          substitution patterns, (4) trapping by addition to nitriles,                    (5) trapping by addition to aldehydes, (6) oxidation,                           cyclization, oxidation, cyclization, (7) oxidative cyclization                  followed by intermolecular trapping, (8) oxidation,                             cyclization, allylation, oxidation and cyclization, (9) use of                  conjugated beta-keto esters, (10) use of sulfoxides for                         asymmetric free-radical cyclization, (11) probes for the                        reversibility of radical cyclization, (12) oxidative                            cyclization of unsaturated silyl enol ethers, (13) oxidative                    cyclization of unsaturated silyloxycyclopropanes, and (14)                      conversion of other radicals to alkenes with copper                             carboxylates.  In the area of total synthesis, syntheses are                    planned of: (1) velloziolone, (2) a key tricyclic intermediate                  for gibberellic acid synthesis, (3) steviol, (4) iresin, (5)                    avenaciolide, and (6) models for aklavinone synthesis.                                                                                                          The Organic Synthesis Program is continuing the support of Dr                   Snider's studies of Mn(III)-based oxidative free-radical                        cyclizations.  This work has the potential to develop                           simplified new routes to complex polycyclic systems.  These                     should help provide efficient paths to molecules needed by                      modern biology and agriculture.",
