 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a four year program that will provide a one                     week seminar each summer at the Bronx Zoo for secondary                         science teachers. The purpose of the program is to stimulate                    teachers' creativity, improve their instructional skills and                    to give them proficiency in the use of wildlife exhibits to                     motivate students to study science. The seminars will be                        based on the Bronx Zoo's award winning curriculum, Survival                     Strategies. Developed with NSF funds, Survival Strategies                       has been recognized as an effective program by the U.S.                         Department of Education; the New York State Department of                       Education; and the Johns Hopkins University Center for                          Research on Effective Schooling for Disadvantaged Students.                                                                                                     Each summer, beginning in 1992, an intensive 5 day seminar                      will accommodate 35 science teachers of grades 7-11,                            selected from secondary schools throughout the United                           States. Following completion of the seminar, each                               participant teacher will offer in-service training for other                    science teachers from their local area.",
