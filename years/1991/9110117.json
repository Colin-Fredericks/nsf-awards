 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Narrative: This proposal will continue the joint India-U.S.           research program in theoretical astrophysics begun in 1987 between the          Tata Institute and the University of Chicago.  Dr. S. M. Chitre of the          Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, India and Dr. David             Schramm of the University of Chicago are the co-principal inves-                tigators.  The main focus of the program is nuclear astrophysics with           a fitting  emphasis in the past three years on the supernova that               occurred on February 23, 1987 (SN1987A).  For a field that has been             theoretically dominated in the past, this event has added a new                 dimension through the observations that have occurred, especially in            the Large Magellanic Cloud.  The proposed studies of the supernova              are expected to address the following issues: 1) How does a type II             supernova explode? 2) What are the number, orbital period distribution          and mass ratios of binary stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud? 3) How           many pulsars are there in the galactic globular cluster systems and             what is their evolutionary origin?  The proposed research will                  address also the recent interest in the role of the quark-hadron                phase transition in the early universe, and ultra-high energy cosmic            ray interactions.                                                                                                                                               Scope: The two scientists who are eminent in the field in their                 respective countries plan to continue their collaboration in                    theoretical astrophysics studying nuclear structure in the early                universe and in a contemporary high energy environment, the massive             stars that explode as supernovae.  Specifically, the focus is nuclear           astrophysics, supernovae, and the quark-hadron transition in the                early universe.  The results of advances in this field are wide-                ranging in the understanding of the physics of matter, astronomy and            astrophysics.",
