 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to learn how insulin controls the                   activity of pyuvate dchydrogenase (PDH).  PDH is a metabolic                    \"linch-pin\" between energy-yielding processes and biosynthetic                  pathways, and it therefore plays a key role in the oxidative                    metabolism of glucose.  Most insulin effects result from                        interactions between insulin and the insulin receptor (IR), which               is located on the surfaces of target cells.  When insulin binds to              the IR, it stimulates the IR to attach phosphate groups to a number             of cellular proteins that participate in metabolic reactions.  This             modification alters the behavior of the targeted proteins - it                  enhances the activities of some and inhibits the activities of                  others.  But the protein kinase of the IR was not required for the              insulin stimulation of PDH activity (preliminary results).                      Therefore, the specific aim of this proposal is to learn how the                insulin receptor communicates with PDH.  This will be accomplished              by identifying the domains of the insulin receptor that are                     specifically required for insulin to stimulate PDH.  To accomplish              this goal, a number of deletion mutations in the insulin receptor               will be analyzed for possible effects on insulin stimulation of                 PDH.  Appropriate controls will be performed to verify that the                 mutant receptors are made in the correct way and to quantitate the              numbers of receptors that are expressed at the cell surface, and                to ascertain whether the mutations introduce localized or global                changes in the confiaguration of the insulin receptor B chain.                  Global changes could affect a variety of insulin responses, and not             just the stimulation of PDH.                                                                                                                                    These studies will provide important information in the mechanism               of action of this vital hormone.//",
