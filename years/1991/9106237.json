 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collective phenomena in condensed matter systems associated with                quenched randomness and transport will be investigated.  Phenomena              to be studied include the effects of thermal fluctuations and                   pinning on eqilibrium and non-equilibrium behavior in Type-II                   superconductors in a magnetic field and statics and dynamics of                 spin glasses, random magnets and other systems such as cross-linked             gels.  All of these involve classical phase transitions in the                  presence of randomness and slow dynamics which result from a                    distribution of barrier heights.  The statistical behavior of                   nonlinear collective transport phenomena such as the nonlinear                  dynamics of flux lines in superconductors, sliding charge density               waves, fluids in porous media, sand piles and the motion of                     geologic faults will be studied with an emphasis on their universal             features.  The effects of randomness on low temperature quantum                 mechanical behavior of superfluids, superconductors, metals and                 spin systems will also be investigated.  In particular, the nature              of the zero temperature phase transitions, such as metal-insulator              transitions, will be studied.                                                   %%%                                                                             The study of the collective behavior of many-particle systems lies              at the foundation of condensed matter, or solid state, physics.                 However, very few, if any, of these systems are perfect.  To                    varying degrees all condensed matter systems have randomness                    associated with their properties.  The proposed research will study             the effects of randomness in a variety of specific systems of                   current interest, such as superconductors and magnets, to determine             its effects on the system statics, dynamics and transport.  This                basic research will look for universal features which are common to             these systems and thus provide a solid physical understanding of                the behavior of a variety of condensed matter systems.",
