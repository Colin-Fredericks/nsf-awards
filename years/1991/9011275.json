 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the effects of different oxygen-containing                   functional groups on the dispersion, sinter resistance, and                     catalytic behavior of palladium on carbon and of platinum-tin                   on carbon.  The strategy is to alter, in a controlled way, the                  concentrations of carboxyl, lactone, carbonyl, hydroxyl, and                    phenolic groups on a high-purity carbon.  Historically,                         attempts to do this have been frustrated by the difficulty of                   characterizing carbon surfaces.  In this study, carbon                          surfaces are characterized by reflection infrared                               spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis /mass spectrometry,                  and differential microcalorimetry after treatment at 1000\u001a to                   remove all surface groups and after treatments in air, nitric                   acid, and hydrogen peroxide to selectively restore certain                      groups.  Novel approaches to the preparation of metal/carbon                    catalysts involve the synthesis and impregnation of palladium                   and platinum-tin organometallic complexes that can be easily                    reduced at low temperatures.  The influence of palladium                        crystallite size on magnetic and chemical properties is                         determined by magnetic susceptibility measurements, heats of                    adsorption for oxygen, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen on the                     metal, infrared spectra of chemisorbed carbon monoxide, and                     solid-state magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance of                  chemisorbed hydrogen as well as palladium-105.                                                                                                                  The work addresses directly the performance of carbon-                          supported noble-metal catalysts, but the results are also                       relevant to production and use of carbon electrodes, coal                       gasification, and petroleum reforming.  Carbon-supported                        noble-metal catalysts are widely used in the specialty                          chemicals and petrochemicals industries.",
