 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will conduct research in three                  areas of the theory of stochastic processes and related partial                 differential equations.  The first area is concerned with proving               the large deviation principle for Markov stochastic processes                   with \"discontinuous statistics,\" a class that includes diffusions               with discontinuous drift and small diffusion coefficient as well                as certain scaled queueing systems.  The second area considers                  the problem of obtaining the full asymptotic expansion for                      certain important classes of jump Markov processes.  The last                   part of the proposed work involves research in the area of                      numerical methods for continuous time stochastic control                        problems.                                                                            The principal investigator will conduct research on several                problems that are at the interface of stochastic processes, a                   branch of probability theory, and stochastic control, a branch of               applied mathematics.  The problems are motivated by issues                      involved with understanding systems of queues, which arise                      naturally in several applications, for example communications.",
