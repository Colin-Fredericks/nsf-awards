 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in ecology                       between Dr. David Myrold, Oregon State University and Dr.                       Kerstin Huss-Danell, Department of Plant Physiology, University                 of Umea, Sweden.                                                                                                                                                The project will examine two important questions concerning                     Alnus-Frankia symbiosis, namely the effect of several factors                   on the biomass and diversity of Frankia in the soil and the                     amount of fixed N released to the soil by nodulated Alnus. In                   particular, soil will be sampled from an established research                   site that has been treated by liming, NPK fertilization and                     the introduction of alder.  This soil will be assayed for                       Frankia biomass by plant bioassay and DNA probe methods. The                    results of these experiments will not only provide important                    new information in understanding Alnus-Frankia symbiosis, but                   will by extension provide new insight into actinorhizal                         plants in general.  These plants are ecologically important,                    because they can alter ecosystem level processes by rapidly                     altering the nitrogen content of the systems in which they                      occur.  They also have importance in forestry, land reclamation                 and horticulture. This project will benefit from the compleme-                  ntary expertise of Dr. Myrold in microbiology and of Dr.                        Huss-Danell in plant physiology. Dr. Myrold will also be able                   to take advantage of a field site in Sweden which has been                      extensively studied and is exceptionally well suited to the                     proposed research.",
