 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator is developing methods for studying the                    structure of isolated invariant sets that are applicable to a                   wide variety of problems, e.g., travelling waves for                            reaction-diffusion systems, dynamic phase transition,                           magnetohydrodynamic shock waves, delay equations, to name a few.                More specifically, it is concerned with deriving algebraic                      invariants that describe invariant sets, determining how they can               change through bifurcations, and determining which geometric                    topological structures are imposed on the invariant sets by the                 algebraic invariants.                                                                The guiding philosophy behind these methods comes from the                 fact that many differential equations that arise as models of                   biological, chemical, or physical systems share the following                   three characteristics:  (1) they are derived from idealized                     descriptions of complicated phenomena, (2) they are parameterized               systems and exact values of the parameters are not known,                       (3) they are nonlinear.  Thus, from the point of view of                        applications, describing the global and robust structure of the                 solutions to these differential equations is of great importance.               At the same time, it is well known that nonlinear systems undergo               tremendously complicated bifurcations (e.g., the appearance                     of chaotic dynamics).  Therefore, any general theory must rely on               tools that are indifferent to the fine structure of the invariant               sets, e.g. the Conley index theory.",
