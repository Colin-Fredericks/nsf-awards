 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two recent independent studies, one in the SE corner of South              Dakota, and the other in north central Kansas, indicate a striking              departure in the stress regime west of the Midcontinent Rift (MCR)              from that established in Wisconsin-Illinois and more eastern states             and assumed until now to prevail throughout the Midcontinent stress             province.  Near-surface in situ stress measurements in South Dakota             and a focal mechanism solution of an earthquake in Kansas (depth                1.3 km or greater) both indicate a 90o rotation in the direction                of the maximum horizontal stress which is uniformly northeastern                in all the previous Midcontinent measurements.  The new findings                are supported by two earlier focal mechanism solutions suggesting               west-northwest stress direction.  However, this fascinating and                 important observation, which may require a redistribution of the                stress provinces in the continental U.S., is incomplete in that                 stress magnitudes representative of the upper crust are difficult               to ascertain from near-surface tests, and are impossible to                     determine from focal mechanism solutions.  The goal of this project             is to verify the unexpected results west of the MCR, and complement             them with credible estimates of the magnitudes of in situ principal             stresses, by conducting a comprehensive series of hydraulic                     fracturing stress measurements in basement granite at depths of                 about 600 m using the existing Quimby, Iowa Scientific hole.",
