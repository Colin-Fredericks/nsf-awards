 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will characterize relationships between remotely                     sensed ocean color and the vertical profiles of bio-optical                     variables and primary productivity - and their interannual and                  seasonal variabilities - to address central goals of the U.S.                   JGOFS Equatorial Pacific Plan.  It is hypothesized that                         photoadaptation by phytoplankton creates vertical profiles of                   pigments and optical profiles which, in a given geographic                      province and time of year, are predictable functions of near-                   surface optical properties estimable from remotely sensed ocean                 color.  It is further speculated that the joint profiles of                     natural and stimulated fluorescence and optical properties are                  photoadaptive characteristics which may correlate with primary                  productivity.  Optical and fluorescence (natural and                            stimulated) measurements will be acquired during the JGOFS                      EqPac cruises, which in combination with core measurements of                   pigments and productivity, will be used to develop empirical                    models of these relationships.  These results will enable                       pigment biomass and productivity analyses of past (CZCS) and                    future (SeaWiFS) ocean color data, as well as contributing to                   the assessment of regional biogeochemical processes in the                      context of the overall JGOFS EqPac data set.",
