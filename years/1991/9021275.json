 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Kathryn Jakes and                 her collaborators will develop techniques to identify fibers                    which were used by prehistoric Native American peoples and then                 use the results of this work to analyze archaeological materials                from two archaeological sites.  They will first accumulate a                    comparative collection of plants which they believe were                        potentially used for these purposes.  The fibrous plant materials               will then be processed by pulling, cutting, retting and                         carbonizing and then examined by a variety of techniques.  These                include a number of different photomicroscopy approaches as well                as scanning electron microscopy and X ray analysis.  On this                    basis, criteria for species identification can be established and               methods developed to determine prehistoric manufacturing                        processes.  Finally, the results will be applied to two sites,                  the Middle Woodland period Seip Mound in Ohio and the                           Mississippian period Etowah site in Georgia.                                                                                                                    While textiles are sometimes encountered in prehistoric Native                  American sites, currently it is often not possible to determine                 either how they were manufactured or the raw materials of which                 they are composed.  Archaeologists are interested in these issues               not only because of the textiles themselves, but also for what                  they reveal about prehistoric use of the environment and the                    light they shed on social structure.  It is postulated that                     within a site, the greater the variation in the types of fabrics                produced and the quality and techniques of manufacture, the                     greater the social complexity of the group involved.  This                      hypothesis will be evaluated through the analysis of Seip and                   Etowah materials.                                                                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 an identification key which will be useful to a large number of                 archaeologists who work at many sites.  It will examine the                     relationship between variation in material and social complexity                and increase our understanding of two important prehistoric                     sites.  Since graduate students will participate, it will assist                in the training of young scientists.",
