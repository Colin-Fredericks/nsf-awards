 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research involves a combination of method                          development for the acquisition of structural information                       about enzyme-substrate or enzyme-inhibitor complexes, and                       site-directed mutagenesis studies on B-lactamase to determine                   the role of active-site residues in catalysis and inhibition.                   Fourier Transfer Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, especially                       attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FTIR, will be used to                        study enzyme-substrate intermediates (stabilized at low                         temperatures) and enzyme-inhibitor (e.g. transition state                       analogs) complexes.  FTIR has the potential to reveal not                       only new bonds formed in enzyme-ligand complexes, but also                      bond deformations and polarization, as well as conformational                   changes in the enzyme.  These methods will be applied to                        several systems to increase our understanding of the                            molecular basis for enzyme catalysis and inhibition .                           Resistance of pathogenic organisms toward B-lactam                              antibiotics is a major international health problem. In the                     majority of cases the reason for the resistance is the                          presence of B-lactamases produced by the infectious agent,                      which hydrolyze the B-lactam rendering it ineffective as a                      antibiotic .  This research is aimed at increasing our                          understanding of the mechanism of catalysis of B-lactamases.m                   Site-directed mutagenesis will be used to determine the role                    of several residues which have been proposed to be important                    in catalysis.  The ultimate goal is the design of mechanism-                    based inhibitors of the B-lactamases which will also function                   as antibiotics.",
