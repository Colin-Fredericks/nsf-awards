 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year project, sponsored by Southern Illinois                         University-Carbondale, will teach middle school teachers                        science content and science-related social issues.  In the                      first year 22 key middle school teachers and eleven                             instructional supervisors will be involved.  In the second                      year 33 other teachers will be involved.  These participants                    will receive instruction in science content, investigate                        local STS issues and learn specific methods to teach middle                     school students these same skills.  Assisted by project                         staff the teachers in the program will provide inservice                        training to colleagues in other districts.  In the third                        year the prior participants, and administrators from their                      schools, will attend a one-week workshop relating to staff                      development and program implementation.  As a result of this                    project at the end of three years each district served will                     have in place a component of its science curriculum focused                     on science-related social issues, teachers trained in this                      issue-related approach, a cadre of key teachers and                             administrators who can provide training to new teachers as                      they move into the district and a staff development program                     designed for that particular district which will insure                         continuation of this program.  The matching funds provided                      by the University, Maryville College and the school                             districts are equal to 125% of the NSF grant.",
