 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Balbus will pursue a number of different theoretical studies                involving large scale astrophysical gas dynamics.  The                          investigations involve primarily galactic scale systems, and                    emphasis is placed on our own Galaxy in most of the projects.  The              projects have been motivated by observations of ionized gas in the              disk and the halo of our Galaxy, as well as by observations of cool             gas in the disk of the Galaxy.  Theoretical developments in the                 field of nonlinear dynamics have also been an important stimulus                for at least one of the studies.                                                                                                                                There is little question that the problems of understanding large               scale disk structure in our Galaxy are entwined with the dynamical              properties of its gaseous interstellar medium (ISM).  This is due               not only to the well appreciated connection between the ISM and                 dynamically cold star formation, but also to the belated                        realization that the highly responsive gas is an important                      structural component in its own right, whether or not it happens                to be making stars.  Dr. Balbus' studies generally share a common               purpose of developing the connection between local and global                   gasdynamical processes commonly occurring in the disk and halo of               our Galaxy.",
