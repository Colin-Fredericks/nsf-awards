 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biophysical mechanism of protein translocation into                      mitochondria will be studied.  Most proteins imported from the                  cytoplasm into mitochondria contain amino-terminal targetting                   sequences that direct the uptake of the proteins into the                       organelle.  These sequences have characteristic physical                        properties and function as independent domains of the precursor                 proteins.  The minimal sequence necessary for targetting the                    beta-subunit of the yeast F1-ATPase into mitochondria has been                  identified and heavily mutagenized by other workers.  These                     studies have identified residues that are critical for the                      function of this targetting sequence.  Peptides corresponding to                the the wild-type sequence, and a series of single and double                   point mutants that are greatly diminished in their ability to                   import proteins into mithocondria in vivo, will be synthesized                  chemically.  The physical behavior of the peptides will be                      measured using biophysical techniques and compared to the                       properties previously found for other mitochondrial targetting                  sequences.  Sensitive and quantitative fluorescence- based assays               will then be used to measure peptide binding to and import into                 isolated yeast mitochondria.  Effects of the mutations on                       interactions of the peptides with mitochondria will identify                    features of a presequence that are important for its function.                                                                                                   The mitochondrion is the major energy transducing unit of                      eukaryotic cells, containing within it the enzymatic machinery to               carry out oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., oxidative conversion                 of C-C bond energy to CO2 and ATP).  The organelle (like its                    cousin, the chloroplast) contains its own DNA, RNA, and                         protein-synthetic machinery, and some of its integral proteins                  are mitochondrial gene products.  However (again like the                       chloroplast), most of the proteins found in the mitochondria are                products of nuclear genes, which are translated by cytoplasmic                  ribosomes and subsequently translocated across the mitochondrial                double membrane system.  This project addresses the very                        important problem of the mechanism of this protein translocation                process.",
