 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adding Breadth and Laboratories to the Introductory Computer                   Science CoursesThis project develops two modifications to the                   first two years of the undergraduate computer science                           curriculum in response to ACM recommendations.  The first                       modification broadens the focus of these courses from primarily                 software development techniques to consideration of the breadth                 of the computer science discipline.  The second change blends                   the use of scheduled, structured laboratories with the                          traditional lecture approach.  Students are provided activities                 that require the concrete manipulation of the concepts                          discussed in the lecture portion of the course.  Project                        activities include the development and class-testing of lecture                 and text materials to support the \"breadth\" approach to content                 presentation.  Materials are also being developed to support                    the laboratory portion of the courses.  These laboratory                        exercises are sufficiently independent of the lecture to allow                  them to be used with curricular arrangements other than the one                 being developed in this project.  The project includes an                       assessment component that attempts to measure the effectiveness                 of the materials developed during the project.  Finally, the                    project will disseminate the results of the curriculum and                      materials development phases through summer workshops,                          publications, and presentations at professional meetings.",
