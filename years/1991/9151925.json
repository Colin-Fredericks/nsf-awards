 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enables coordinating the teaching of physics and                   mathematics via the use of common software and hardware                         systems.   The project introduces a common computer laboratory                  for the large number of students enrolled in both General                       Physics and Calculus.  A coordinating group from the                            Departments of Physics and Mathematics has been established to                  develop a unified pedagogical approach.  a unified                              technological approach will be used which includes a common                     computer system, common software systems such as Mathematica                    and 20/20, a common graphical system, and common text                           processing systems.  The coordinating group is  overseeing the                  introduction of topics, the development of appropriate                          techniques, and the assessment of the efficacy of the methods                   chosen.  The initial emphasis in physics is in the  development                 of new approaches for the teaching of general physics                           laboratory while in mathematics the emphasis is on the                          development of computer based methods of teaching the calculus.                 Following these, the approach will be applied to instruction in                 the mathematical methods of physics and differential equations.                 It is expected that the systems and methods introduced at each                  stage in the project will be applicable in all succeeding                       courses in both departments.",
