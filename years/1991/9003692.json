 "awd_abstract_narration": "This application proposes an international cooperation among                    three American and three Soviet laboratories.  The scientific                   objective is to define the relative movements between myosin                    subfragment 1 (S-1) and actin (in complex) under the influence                  of ATP hydrolysis going on in S-1.  These movements, underlying                 muscle contraction and some cell motility, are thought to                       accomplish energy transduction (free energy of ATP hydrolysis                   to mechanical (force x distance) work).  Optically-detected                     molecular probes are to be used in pairs, either to detect                      correlated re-orientation or to detect change in scalar                         distances, the purpose being to decide whether the movements                    in transduction are a global rotation of S-1 caused by very                     small internal displacements (present \"standard model\") or                      whether internal movements encompass most of S-1 (as in                         interdomain movement).  Efforts will be made---using                            differential scanning calorimetry circular dichroism---to                       obtain indications of domain structure, and also to examine the                 effect of crosslinks on the putative movements of these                         domains.  Attempts also will be made to develop both physical                   (S-1 on oriented pure F-actin) and molecular graphic models in                  order to simplify the foregoing studies.  Besides the six                       senior investigators, several students and young associates                     would participate in this work.  The principal significance of                  this proposal is basic.  Since no biological energy transducer                  has yet been explained, the possibility of discovering design                   features also may be of practical interest.",
