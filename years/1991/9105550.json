 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acyl lipids of chloroplasts contain characteristically high                 proportions of trienoic fatty acids.  Because this feature is                   universal among higher plants, it has been inferred that the fatty              acid composition of chloroplast membranes is important for                      maintaining photosynthetic function.  However, the enzymology and               regulation of polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis are poorly                   understood, and there is at present no accepted model of exactly                how photosynthesis might be dependent on a highly unsaturated                   membrane.  The principal investigator has isolated a series of                  Arabidopsis mutants with specific alterations in leaf fatty acid                composition and these have provided a novel means to study both                 plant lipid metabolism and the physiological significance of                    membrane lipid composition.  This proposal describes experiments                to characterize the biochemistry of newly isolated mutants, and of              double mutants produced by crossing mutant lines.  This aspect of               the project will involve assaying enzymes of fatty acid synthesis               as well as in vivo labeling experiments and analysis of the fatty               acid compositions of individual lipids and subcellular fractions.               The most extreme double mutants are unable to grow autotrophically,             but many of the mutations only affect growth and development of the             plants at low temperatures.  For this reason, photosynthesis in the             different mutants will be analyzed under a range of environmental               conditions using non-invasive fluorescence and light absorption                 techniques which can be used on intact plants.  These experiments               would provide a clear picture of exactly how photosynthesis is                  affected by thylakoid lipid composition under the different growth              conditions normally encountered by temperate plants.  The improved              understanding of lipid metabolism and photosynthesis that will                  result from the work are important prerequisites to modifying these             processes for increase plant productivity.                                                                                                                           //",
