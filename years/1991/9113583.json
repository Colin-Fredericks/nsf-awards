 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Science in Developing Countries award will support a                       regional research workshop on Science and the State, to be held                 in Mexico City in January 1992 in conjunction with the Third                    Congress of the Latin American Society for the History of                       Science and Technology.  Organizers are Joan Bromberg and James                 Griesemer of the University of California at Davis and Juan                     Salda\u001aa, an organizer of the Third Congress in Mexico.  The                     workshop aims to examine the relationship between the scientific                community in the Americas and the State, their differences, and                 strategies that could be adopted for a more effective perfor-                   mance.                                                                                                                                                          Nine U.S. panelists will present the results of recent research                 on the relationship between U.S. Federal and state governments                  and science and technology, from the country's beginning until                  the present.  Nine Latin American historians will compare the                   U.S. experience with that of their nations.  The workshop will                  formulate problems for further historical research and lessons                  for today's science policy.  The benefits to both U.S. and                      Latin American participants are the development of new areas for                regional research cooperation and the potential for improving                   the nations' scientific infrastructures.",
