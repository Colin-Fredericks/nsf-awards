This area of                       stochastic calculus is a field within probability theory which                  has impact on several disciplines:  electrical engineering,                     mathematical physics, finance and economics.  In particular, the                investigator will study weak convergence of stochastic integrals                and stochastic differential equations, with investigations into                 numerical schemes for approximating solutions of stochastic                     differential equations driven by general semi-martingales.  In                  addition he will study a new type of forward-backward equation                  which arose in finance theory.  Finally, he has proposed a new                  type of Stratonovich stochastic differential equation for general               semimartingales which allows approximation of the jumping                       differentials by continuous processes in a Wong-Zakai manner.                        The principal investigator will conduct research in several                areas of stochastic differential equations.
