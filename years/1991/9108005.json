 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to study the genetic and molecular basis of                     regulatory interactions termed cross talk between the phosphate                 (PHO) regulon and genes in the creABCD, formerly called phoM,                   operon and to define the biological role of the creABCD operon in               Escherichia coli.  The project focuses entirely on regulatory                   interactions involving the creABCD operon.  The PHO regulon encodes             genes for the acquisition of environmental phosphorus (P) and is                induced when the external (ext) inorganic phosphate (Pi) level is               growth limiting. The creABCD operon, whose expression is unaffected             by Pi(ext), seems to respond to the level of an internal (int)                  organophosphate formed in central metabolism, which may be formed               in substrate-level phosphorylation (in glycolysis or the TCA cycle)             at a step where Pi(int) is incorporated into organophosphate.                   Regulatory interactions are expected between genes in a                         metabolic pathway; Pi(ext) to Pi(int) to organophosphate (int) in               which Pi(ext) regulates the PHO regulon and organophosphate(int)                may regulate both the PHO regulon and the creABCD operon. Such                  cross talk may be an example of an underlying control mechanisms                essential for general (global) control of cell metabolism and                   growth; this is especially apparent in the control of gene                      expression in bacteria, but may quite possibly play the same role               in eucaryotic cells too.",
