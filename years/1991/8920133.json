 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Illinois will establish a Science and Technology              Center for Magnetic Resonance Technology for Basic Biological                   Research.  The Director of the Center will be Professor Paul C.                 Lauterbur.                                                                      The goal of the Center is to develop the world's most advanced                  magnetic resonance imaging instrumentation technically feasible for             the study of living organisms, individual cells, live animals, and              humans and apply it to the most challenging problems in the life                sciences, with a specific focus on brain physiology, anatomy, and               function.  Five institutions will contribute to the program in a                coordinated fashion.  These comprise the University of Illinois,                the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the Texas Accelerator Center, the             University of Chicago, and the IBM Watson Research Laboratory.  The             two principal elements of the Center's program are:                                                                                                             1.  The development of magnetic resonance imaging instrumentation               covering a wide range of methodologies and technical approaches,                including the design and implementation of a four Tesla, one-meter              bore magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy system, advanced               NMR microscopy instrumentation for both imaging and spectroscopy,               further development of targetable NMR reagents for the study of                 perfusion and cell labeling, and the development of tools for                   mathematical modeling of complex physiologic processes.                                                                                                         2.  The application of this instrumentation and its associated                  methodologies for the study of a wide range of the most challenging             life sciences problems.  Specifically it will be devoted to the                 understanding of complex biological processes relating structure,               dynamics, and chemistry of the living brain.                                                                                                                    Development of the magnetic resonance imaging instrumentation will              allow metabolic processes in living animals and humans to be                    studied noninvasively in real time, and its application to brain                physiology, metabolism and function would mark a major breakthrough             in this field.  The ability to construct images using nuclei other              than protons (such as phosphorus) will add a new dimension to new               ways of studying biological problems.                                                                                                                           This Center will stimulate enhanced activity in education and in                the development of human resources.",
