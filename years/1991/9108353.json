 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation, the Arizona                  State University (ASU) Department of Anthropology will curate                   major parts of their archaeology and physical anthropology                      collections.  The overall holdings, of which these materials form               a significant part include over 2,000,000 specimens with                        associated archival records and together these comprise one of                  the largest in the American Southwest.  At the present time,                    these materials are difficult to use because they are not fully                 catalogued and individual items are therefore difficult to                      locate.  Storage conditions are less than optimal and this                      results in risk to the objects themselves.  To address these                    problems, most of the archaeological collections as well as a                   large series of dental casts will be inventoried.  The                          information will be entered into a computerized index.  Archival                paper records will be preserved and storage cabinets and                        containers will be purchased to preserve the objects.                                                                                                           The ASU collections are of great anthropological significance and               an important source of research data.  The archaeological                       materials included in the project derive primarily from the                     Southwest and the majority were excavated from ca. 900 sites in                 central Arizona.  This was the prehistoric core area of Hohokam                 culture.  Within this region, numerous towns, hamlets, and                      individual farmsteads constituted one of the densest areas of                   human settlement in prehistoric North America and are associated                with one of the most extensive prehistoric irrigation systems                   known.  The dental materials which are included in this                         conservation project include over 15,000 casts of human dentition               and represent about 11,000 individuals.  In many instances                      multiple casts were taken over the lifetimes of single                          individuals and information about biological relationships among                individuals is available.  These materials provide an ideal base                for longitudinal studies of dental development, wear, attrition                 and disease often among members of a single genetically related                 population.                                                                                                                                                     This project is important both because it will help to preserve                 valuable scientific data and also because it will make this                     information more readily accessible to the scientific community.",
