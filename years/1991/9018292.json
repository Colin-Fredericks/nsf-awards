 "awd_abstract_narration": "When a unidirectional current passes over a bed of coarse                  mixed-size sediment, a variety of bed forms are generated, and                  there is segregation of particle sizes among the load, the bed                  surface layer, and the substrate.  There is a strong and complex                interdependence between the bed forms, the transported sediment,                and the substrate.  Many studies in well sorted sands, both in                  the laboratory and in the field, have led to fairly good                        understanding of the behavior of the familiar dune bed forms and                the interaction between bed forms and transport.  More recently,                features variously described as bed-load sheets, gravel waves,                  and clast jams have been reported in flows over poorly sorted                   sand-gravel mixtures.  The relationships among these seemingly                  diverse bed features, and their dependence on size segregation in               the bed, is unclear.                                                                 This is an experimental study of the nature of bed features                in unidirectional flows as a function of flow strength and                      sediment sorting involving several sediment mixtures with the                   same mean size of about 4 mm but with widely varying sorting and                making series of runs at several mean flow velocities over each                 sediment mixture.  The objective is a unified picture of the                    fundamental characteristics and interrelationships of the various               kinds of bed features produced in these flows.                                       The work will be done in cooperation with Prof. Hiroshi                    Ikeda, Prof. Shigemi Takayama and Dr. Fujiko Iseya of the                       Environmental Research center at the University of Tsukuba.  This               proposal covers salary and travel for the PI and a Graduate                     Research Assistant for two years.  A companion proposal with                    identical scientific text is being submitted by Prof. Peter R.                  Wilcock (The Johns Hopkins University).  The Japanese group                     already has funds for building the experimental apparatus and                   conducting the experiments.",
