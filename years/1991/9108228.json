 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program is to Dr. Alan H. Cowley of the University of Texas at                  Austin for fundamental work on the synthesis of novel compounds                 containing main group elements.  The elements to be studied                     include E = P, As, Sb, and Bi from group 15 and M = Al, Ga, and                 In from group 13.  The goal of the research is to prepare low                   coordination number fragments of RE (i.e., phosphinidenes,                      arsinidenes, stibinidenes, and bismuthinidenes) and RM (four                    electron carbenoid species) and incorporate those fragments                     into novel rings, clusters, and polymers or use them as                         ligands.  The substituent R may be methyl, ethyl, or a wide                     variety of bulky hydrocarbons.  The fragments will be generated                 by thermal, photochemical or electrochemical elimination of                     hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, or disilane and its                  heavier congeners.  The project includes the synthesis of group                 13 heterocycles, the synthesis of group 13 and group 15                         compounds as potential sources of ME fragments, the                             construction of molecules of the type (RMERR)n, where n = 1-3,                  with unusual geometries, and the stabilization of ME fragments                  by coordination to transition metals.                                           %%%                                                                             Preparation of compounds containing aluminum, gallium, or                       indium together with phosphorus, arsenic or antimony may result                 in materials with interesting optical or electrical properties.                 One goal of this research is to attach different types of                       groups which absorb light (chromophores) to compounds                           containing the pairs of elements mentioned above. Introduction                  of such groups could enable use of these or related compounds                   in the manufacture of semiconductors by photo-assisted growth.                  Because diffusion might be reduced and sharper junctions                        produced, this would be a desirable alternative to present                      thermal methods.",
