The main goals of this                             project are: 1) to synthesize and characterize hydrogel                         networks of polyethylene oxide containing hydrophobic                           sites; 2) to study the swelling behavior of gels as a                           function of temperature, salt and surfacant additive; 3)                        to establish the binding characteristics of the gels;                           and 4) to explore potential applications of the hydrogels.                      The researchers are concerned with understanding                                materials derived from polyethylene oxide.   Their                              efforts should produce information regarding compounds                          containing the ethylene oxide moiety.  Such information                         should be an important contribution to the understanding                        of problems related to polyethlene oxide and its many                           derivatives including linear and network polymers, and                          block and graft copolymers.                                                                                                                                     This project in polymers research fulfills the program                          objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe                         to combine complementary talents and pool research                              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                                competence.",
