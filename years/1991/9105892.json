 "awd_abstract_narration": "Translation is a key which gene expression can be regulated.                    Mutations that alter translation initiation in yeast have been                  defined positive (GNC) and negative (GCD) translation regulators                of the transcriptional activator encoded by GCN4.  The objective                of this proposal is to determine the basis for genetic interactions             between two of these translational regulators, those encoded by                 GCN3 and GCD11.  GCN3, which has been characterized at the                      molecular level, also exhibits both genetic and biochemical                     interactions with translation initiation factor eIF-2.  We have                 cloned the GCD11 gene and now propose to characterize GCD11 at the              molecular level by determining its nucleotide sequences, its                    requirement for viability, and its patten of transcription and                  translation.  We will raise antibodies against GCN3 and yeast eIF-              2, to seek physical evidence for interactions among these gene                  products.  These studies are important for bridges the gap between              extensive in vitro biochemical analyses of translation factors and              their proposed roles in vivo.",
