 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an ambitious program of research to advance                 understanding of the conditions likely to promote or discourage war             between major international powers.  A long standing assumption of              international relations, but one rarely tested systematically, is               that the structure of the international system significantly                    influences the probability of war.  In particular, it is held that              the probability of war increases with the level of uncertainty                  in the international system about the likely outcome of war. This               is linked in turn to the number and relative power of nations                   and alliances in the international system. This research develops               and tests a series of hypotheses about the probability of war which             derive from a theoretical model integrating the structure of the                international system with the propensity of national decision                   makers to take risks.                                                                                                                                           Systematic tests of these hypotheses will be undertaken using data              on the population of great power rivalries that have been                       catalogued since 1816.  In addition comparative case studies of                 both typical and deviant cases will be undertaken to illustrate in              greater detail the results of the statistical analyses and to                   illuminate areas of weakness. Finally, the implications of the                  analysis will be explored for possible lessons for reducing the                 likelihood of great power war in the contemporary international                 system.                                                                                                                                                         When completed this research will strengthen our theoretical                    understanding of the effects of different international structures              or world orders on the likelihood of war and facilitate judgements              about the desirability about proposed changes in international                  structure.",
