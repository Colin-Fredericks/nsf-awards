 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this project is to elucidate the nature of                the signal transduction mechanisms in the protozoan ciliate                     Tetrahymena.  This is an important question from the point of view              of evolution because it seems likely that the mechanisms of signal              transduction in metazoa originated from autocrine and paracrine                 mechanisms in unicellular eukaryotes.  There is evidence that                   opioid mechanisms may play an important role in the modulation of               phagocytosis in the protozoan ciliate Tetrahymena.  In particular,              a beta-endorphin-like peptide has been reported in this organism,               and mammalian beta-endorphin inhibits phagocytosis in these cells               with a high potency and efficacy.  The proposed research will                   characterize two important elements of the opioid mechanism in this             organism, the endogenous opioid and the receptor.  This laboratory              has confirmed by means of a radioimmunoassay the presence of a                  beta-endorphin-like peptide in Tetrahymena.  The next goals are to              establish the optimal conditions for the maximal expression of the              peptide by studying how different factors, both environmental and               biochemical, modulate the level of the peptide in the cell and in               the culture medium, and then to purify the peptide from cell                    extracts.  The effect of the purified peptide on phagocytosis in                Tetrahymena and in metazoan models will be compared to that of                  mammalian beta-endorphin.  The primary sequence of the purified                 peptide will be studied to determine its degree of homology with                mammalian beta-endorphin or with other peptides that have been                  reported to have opioid-like activities.  Studies on the putative               beta-endorphin gene in tetrahymena will also be initiated, using                standard recombinant DNA techniques.  This will be done by probing              a cDNA library with either a pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) probe or               an oligonucleotide probe based on the amino acid sequence.  This                will determine whether the putative beta-endorphin gene in                      Tetrahymena is coded independently or is part of a POMC gene, as                in vertebrates.  Studies of the opioid receptor will also be                    initiated to establish whether there is a correlation between the               potency of opioid agonists and antagonists on phagocytosis, and                 their potency in radioligand displacement assays in membrane                    fractions.  This work will also give information about the degree               of opioid receptor microheterogeneity in Tetrahymena.  In addition,             studies will be done to determine how the properties of the                     receptor, including desensitization, are affected by changes in the             ionic environment and by G-proteins.  This will be done to compare              the characteristics of the opioid receptor in Tetrahymena with                  other described subtypes.                                                                                                                                       The results of this research will contribute to our understanding               of the origins and mechanisms of chemical signaling.  In                        particular, it will provide new information on the phylogenetic                 origin of beta-endorphin-like peptides and opioid receptors.  These             studies of the mechanisms by which such peptide mediators affect                a ciliated protozoan may also shed new light on their mechanisms                of action on the cells of higher animals.",
