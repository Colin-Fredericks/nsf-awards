 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports an ethnohistorian studying social identity                and boundary maintenance in colonial societies by means of an                   intensive study of a colonized indigenous elite in central Mexico               in the 17th and 18th centuries.  The importance of class and                    status hierarchies are hypothesized to vary directly with the                   degree of elite market integration and external coercion.                       Increasing preoccupation with noble status in late colonial times               will be related to the economic activities of the villagers,                    coercive policies of state Spanish officials and the nature of                  hacienda labor relations.  Date for the study will come from                    colonial documents in Spanish and Nahuatl (the Aztec language)                  located in Mexico and in Seville, Spain.                                                                                                                        This research contributes to our knowledge of colonial societies                by untangling the complex relations among state coercion, market                forces, social inequality,and social boundaries in a single                     community.  The comparative focus should enhance our                            understanding of community structure and its regional variation                 in Mexico.",
