 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a workshop for Historically Black Colleges                and Universities (HBCU's) Smart Node consultants to the Cornell                 National Supercomputer Facility (CNSF).  The CNSF Smart Node                    program is a consortium of more than 70 institutions nationwide                 that distribute supercomputing expertise, support and training to               researchers and students at their home institution.  The primary                goals of the program are to provide readily available consulting                and training for researcher who access the CNSF's facilities from               remote institutions and to involve participating institutions in                the development of programs that address their supercomputing                   needs. These goals are met through the combined efforts of the                  Theory Center Staff, the CNSF and the Smart Node institutions.                  This project includes an initial training workshop and support for              one of the annual Smart Node consultants meetings.  There will also             be special regional meetings at several of the HBCU institutions.               COntacts between the HBCU's and members of the Theory Center's                  Corporate Research Institute and its industrial partners will be                initiated for the development of student internships and to                     stimulate interactions with faculty.",
