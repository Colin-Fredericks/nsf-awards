 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ninth Southwestern Developmental Biology Conference will be                 held March 21-23, 1991 in College Station, Texas. The meeting is                sponsored by the Society for Developmental Biology, which states                in its guidelines: \"Regional meetings are an important activity                 of the Society...The function of the Regional Conference is to                  provide a more informal opportunity than national meetings for                  the exchange of information on development. participation by                    graduate students, postdoctorals and junior faculty is                          particularly encouraged...\" The meeting will adhere to this goal.               This will be achieved by inviting three prominent speakers to                   present different aspects of \"Epigenesis\". In addition,                         developmental biologists from the Southwestern region will be                   encouraged to present recent and preliminary findings from their                laboratories. Such an arrangement will give the students in the                 Southwest an opportunity to give a talk, meet investigators from                a specialized discipline, and to increase their knowledge about                 the range of research projects pursued in their own geographic                  region.",
