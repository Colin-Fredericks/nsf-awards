 "awd_abstract_narration": "This infrastructure award is for the construction of a                     distributed computing facility.  The network consists of desktop                workstations connected over a medium speed network to back-end                  computation and data-storage servers on a high-speed network.  The              back-end resources consist of mid-speed compute servers, shared                 memory parallel multiprocessors, and massively parallel machines.               The research supported by this infrastructure includes work in                  applied logic using the constructive type theory supported by                   Nuprl; in scientific computing in developing algorithms that                    effectively utilize distributed and massively parallel computing                resources; in modeling and simulation for robotics applications;                and in software for distributed computing.                                           Many problems in experimental computer science require peak                resources not available on a single workstation.  These resources               could be computation cycles or memory.  An emerging solution to                 this problem is to utilize idle processors in a network of                      workstations and compute servers.  The realization of this solution             still requires much research into mechanisms for breaking problems              into pieces so as to minimize communication overhead while                      distributing the computation to make best use of the available                  processors.  The distributed computing researchers at Cornell                   University will use their distributed computing facility as a                   testbed for distributed algorithms.  Three active areas of research             at Cornell will especially benefit from this facility.  The applied             logic group uses a system called Nuprl developed at Cornell to                  support constructive reasoning.  With the use of this tool, open                questions in combinatorics and programming language have already                been answered.  The scientific computing group is already involved              in the construction of a software package called LAPACK for linear              algebra routines that involves constructing new algorithms for                  parallel and distributed machine architectures.  Finally the                    modeling and simulation group requires substantial computational                resources to enable them to use the computing resources as an                   experimental testbed allowing designs to be tested without the                  expense of constructing a robot.",
