 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of animals and human beings to learn and remember is                an adaptation that permits organisms to change their behavior                   when confronted with changing environmental conditions.  The                    ability to learn and remember is a consequence of having a brain                that can change in response to new experiences.  One of the major               goals for researchers studying the nervous system is to identify                particular brain areas or structures that are important for                     specific kinds of learning and memory.  To do so, a variety of                  animals are studied.  In choosing an experimental animal, one                   generally looks for specialized behavior that may simplify the                  task of linking brain regions with particular functions.                                                                                                        Dr. Bingman's research tries to take advantage of the specialized               navigational skills of homing pigeons to identify brain regions                 important for spatial learning and spatial memory.  The basic                   design of the research project is to surgically remove specific                 brain regions and then examine what effect such treatment has on                homing-pigeon navigational behavior.  By examining homing-pigeon                behavior following surgical manipulation of the brain, one can                  begin to construct how various brain regions contribute to the                  spatial learning and spatial memory used by pigeons to navigate                 home.  Dr. Bingman's research should result in a better                         understanding of the relationship between memory/learning and the               brain.  By clarifying how changes in the brain may lead to memory               impairments, this research may also help to enhance our                         understanding of memory disorders in humans.",
