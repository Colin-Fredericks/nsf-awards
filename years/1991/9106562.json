 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators will study a number of                         asymptotic problems for linear and nonlinear partial differential               equations (PDE's) and systems of PDE's using their connections                  with Markov processes.  Such topics as motion of wave fronts,                   impulses and other structures in semilinear parabolic systems,                  coupled elliptic and parabolic equations with small diffusivity                 will be considered.  From a probabilistic point of view the                     results will be of the averaging principle type or of central                   limit theorem and large deviation type for the corresponding                    random processes.  The investigators also will study random                     perturbations of evolutionary PDE's.  The investigators plan to                 develop a theory similar to the theory of random perturbations of               finite dimensional systems.  Many kinds of limit theorems for the               random fields defined by the perturbed PDE's will be considered.                     The principal investigators will study a number of                         asymptotic problems for linear and nonlinear partial differential               equations (PDE's) and systems of PDE's using their connections                  with Markov processes.  This work brings together two fields of                 mathematical research, partial differential equations and                       probability theory.",
