The project will focus on the teaching of algebra                  and geometry, through summer and academic year activity for                     teachers, administrators, and counselors. A total of 80 teachers                and district supervisors of mathematics will be involved in the                 project.  Sixteen pairs of junior high school and high school                   teachers will begin the program in the summer of 1992 in a four-                week summer institute; the last week of the institute will                      involve work in preparing to conduct staff development. The                     teachers will experiment with project ideas during the academic                 year; in the second summer, 16 new participants will be added,                  and the original 32 will participate for two weeks. In the third                summer, an additional 16 teachers will begin, and the 48 prior                  participants also will be involved. With district support,                      participants will provide inservice to their colleagues.                                                                                                        Cost sharing is provided by RESA as 42% of the NSF award.",
