 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in instrument technology have allowed astronomers               their first glimpses of the vestiges of young star formation,                   circumstellar disks around \"T Tauri\" stars.  A study of both these              disks and their central stars is expected to provide fundamental                insights into the early evolution of our own solar system.  The                 Principle Investigator (PI) will continue previous research in                  which he has used infrared and millimeter wavelength interometer                arrays to resolve the disk around two T Tauri stars, including                  clumps of material having masses similar to the planet Jupiter's.               In this renewal program the PI will extend his studies to fainter               brightnesses and hence will be able to study a statistically stable             sample of young stars.  The goals are to understand which                       properties of stars influence disk properties and to examine how                the disks evolve in subsamples of progressively older stars.  A key             question will be to identify the importance of a star's being in                a \"binary\" (a pair of stars born at the same time and orbiting                  around one another).  Current ideas hold that the presence of a                 close binary star will sweep away the matter from a star and                    prevent the formation of a disk and hence a system of planets.  The             PI will test early indications that closely-spaced binaries do not              have disks and that single or widely-spaced binaries do.                                                                                                        The PI will also extend his observational and data reduction                    techniques to the infrared-millimeter study of the center of our                Galaxy, as well as to shocks in interstellar gas created by the                 collisions of external galaxies.",
