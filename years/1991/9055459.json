 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will strengthen and extend support of science                      education by offering a series of Summer Institutes in                          Astronomy for science teachers at secondary and elementary                      levels.  This Institute will take place at the University of                    Toledo (UT), and will use facilities of the Ritter                              Observatory and Ritter Planetarium on the University of                         Toledo Campus.  The workshops/institutes will take place                        during the summers of 1991, 1992 and 1993, and will last for                    three weeks (the first workshop is scheduled for July 22-                       August 9, 1991).  Twenty-five teachers will be selected for                     each workshop.  The teachers will be selected on the basis of                   their backgrounds and recommendations by their department                       head or principal.  These teachers will be \"leaders\" who will                   learn from the UT experience and in turn lead astronomy                         workshops at local and regional levels for other teachers                       interested in using astronomy in their courses.                                                                                                                 The University of Toledo workshop programs will be modeled on                   the very successful Support Program for Instructional                           Competency in Astronomy (SPICA) conducted by the Center for                     astrophysics at Harvard University.  It is a prime goal of                      the UT-SPICA program to use materials and instructional                         techniques developed by the original (Science Teaching                          through its Astronomical Roots) STAR-SPICA programs and                         disseminate them to the teaching community.                                                                                                                     Cost sharing equals 34% of the NSF award.",
