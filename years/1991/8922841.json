 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a visit by Dr. A.J. Sievers of the                          Laboratory of Atomic Physics & Materials Science Center of                      Cornell University to the University of Canterbury in                           Christchurch, New Zealand, to work with Dr. J.A. Campbell on                    a study of the infrared properties of glassy crystals.  Glass                   crystals represent a new materials system in which the                          universal character of glass behavior in solids can be                          probed.  Although X-ray diffraction shows that crystal                          retains its long range order in the glassy state, low                           temperature thermodynamic measurements show that an additional                  low energy spectrum appears identical to that found in                          glasses.  Dr. Campbell proposes to grow and characterize                        glassy Ba(1-x)La(x)F(2+x) crystals where x is varied from                       0.001 to 0.46 so that the glass parameter is altered in a                       systematic manner.  Dr. Sievers proposes to carry out                           persistent IR spectral hole burning measurements on these                       systems to compare the concentration of low lying                               nonequilibrium states to the concentration of thermodynamic                     glassy states.  This proposed application of the persistent                     IR spectral hole burning technique will provide a new                           methodology for investigating and quantifying the physical                      characteristics of the low lying states in glasses.  These                      experiments may also lead to a new understanding of processes                   influencing optical materials applications such as the                          relaxation behavior of optical excitations in laser glasses                     and the permanence of high density optical storage in glassy                    hosts.",
