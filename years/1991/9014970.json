 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Kenneth Sebens of Northeastern University and Dr.J.E.N. Veron                   of the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). Coral                     reefs are among the world's most diverse and scientifically                     intriguing marine habitats.  They are also endangered by                        human activities such as coastal modification, pollution,                       overfishing and global warming.  Research on coral reef                         ecology and the current status of coral reefs is extremely                      importantant at this crucial time in the world's biotic                         history. This project extends ongoing research on water flow                    effects on corals to field sites along the Great Barrier Reef                   in Australia.  The region offers the world's most extensive                     reef system, a great variety of waterflow conditions, and                       extensive diversity of coral growth forms and species. The                      hypothesis to be tested is that water motion has a positive                     effect on particle (prey) capture by corals, and thus on                        growth rates, and that these processes are strongly affected                    by coral growth form and polyp size. Knowledge of water flow                    effects on corals is important as basic information on coral                    biology, and may also help explain why coral reefs change                       when shorelines are modified, and what flow conditions are                      optimal for reef growth.                                                                                                                                        The project represents excellent U.S. and Australian                            collaboration.  AIMS is the world center for research on corals                 because of its proximity to the Great Barrier Reef,its                          excellent ship and laboratory facilities, and its expertise                     in coral biology. Dr. Veron is one of the world's leading                       authorities on coral taxonomy, biology, and ecology. Dr. Sebens                 brings to the project results and hypotheses generated by his                   studies on Caribbean coral reefs of the effects of water                        movement on zooplankton capture by corals. The project                          represents a coordinated and cost-sharing research approach                     with the potential to significantly advance understanding of                    coral ecology.",
