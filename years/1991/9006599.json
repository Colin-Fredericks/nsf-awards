 "awd_abstract_narration": "Echinoderms are a phylum of invertebrates that include                     starfish, sea urchins and cucumbers, crinoids (\"sea lilies\"),                   sand dollars, and several extinct groups, known only from the                   fossil record.  One theory regards the echinoderms as the                       ancestral group from which vertebrates arose.  The evolutionary                 relationships and history of diversification within the                         echinoderms has been the subject of research for many decades,                  and data from fossils, skeletal morphology, and most recently,                  DNA sequences have been amassed for this purpose.  These studies                have also attempted to place the echinoderms in the evolutionary                framework of other major animal groups.  Dr. Edward Ruppert is a                leading specialist in invertebrate developmental and comparative                biology, and he proposes research on the internal anatomy of                    echinoderms, with particular attention to the axial complex,                    which controls the water vascular system.                                            The proposed research will have wide-ranging impact.  The                  new anatomical data will help to interpret the functional anatomy               of a diverse and worldwide group, and these data may help resolve               many remaining questions surrounding the group's evolution.  An                 independent data set such as this will be compared with existing                data, such as the DNA sequences, opening opportunities for future               research on the mosaic nature of evolution among different                      character systems.  The results of this study will have a wide                  audience beyond echinoderm specialists.",
