GR                         catalyzes:                                                                                                                                                      CH2NH3+COO- + Pi  2e      CH3COOPO3= + NH4+                                     The reaction involves reductive cleavage of the C-N bond, a very                difficult reaction.  Additionally, it leads to the formation of a               high energy bond.  GR contains a seleno-cysteine residue.  For                  these reasons the mechanism of action is of interest.                           A Methionine Salvage Pathway                                                    Throughout this pathway, 5'-S-methyl adenosine is converted to                  formate and methionine.  This pathway occurs in all living                      organisms.  We have elucidated some, but not all intermediates, of              this pathway, and have characterized some of the enzymes.  We                   intend to characterized the remaining enzymes and intermediates.                The pathway in micro-organisms differs in one step from the                     mammalian pathway.  We plan to make use of this difference to                   selectively introduce compounds into bacteria which will be                     metabolized to bacteriocidal compounds.                                         Cystathionine Sunthase (CS)                                                     CS, a pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzyme, catalyzes the                       replacement of the -OH group of serine by homocysteine.  We                     propose that the enzyme controls the course of the reaction by                  rotating the B-carbon between two positions.  Elimination occurs                from one, but not from the other.  Experiments will be carried                  out to test this mechanism.",
