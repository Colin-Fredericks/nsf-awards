 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will facilitate cooperation in chemistry between                     Professor John H. Frederick of the University of Nevada,                        Reno, and the high resolution spectroscopy group headed by                      Professor Keitaro Yoshihara at the Institute for Molecular                      Science, Okazaki for a period of two years.  The scientists                     will undertake a detailed study of the photoisomerization                       dynamics of stilbene and the spectroscopic analysis of                          cis-stilbene analogs.  This system is a prototype for many                      naturally occurring photoisomerization reactions, including                     those associated with photosynthesis and vision.  These                         processes typically involve large molecules with many                           electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom and are therefore                     very difficult to treat theoretically.  To eliminate some of                    these difficulties, the scientists will employ a two-fold                       approach:  (1) focusing only on a few of the low frequency                      vibrations that are pivotal in the isomerization reactions of                   cis-stilbene, and (2) first studying simpler systems that                       display activity in the same types of low frequency vibrations                  as cis-stilbene, but which do not undergo an isomerization                      reaction.                                                                                                                                                       The goal of this collaborative project, which involves the                      close interplay of experiment and theory, is to clarify the                     details of the fundamental isomerization process and add                        insight into the photochemical processes occurring in a                         variety of environments, including biological systems (vision                   and photosynthesis), surface coatings, and conductive                           polymers.  The study of cis-trans isomerization is very                         important not only because this reaction is the most                            fundamental chemical reaction, but also because of its                          important role in photosynthesis (bacteriorhodospin) as well                    as in photoreception (vision, etc.).",
