Twelve minority engineering students at the end of their           junior year are recruited to have the research experience.  The duration        of the research activity for each student is expected to be one academic        year (one summer and two semesters).  Each undergraduate is paired with         a graduate student in an on-going funded research program under the             leadership of six faculty mentors.  The funded research areas are in            composite materials, fatigue, fracture mechanics, robotics, electric            propulsion and hypersonic flow.  Students participating in this program         are required to register for a three-credit hour Research course which          is used as a technical elective.  A technical report and an oral                presentation of the research work are required.  Biweekly meetings              during the regular semesters and weekly meetings during the summer              provide the forum for progress reports and exchange of information.",
