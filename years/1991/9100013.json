 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing concern about the reduction of many plant and animal              species in many locales have led to reexamination of the criteria by            which many sites are managed.  Forest management practices, for example,        are under review in order to determine whether mixed-species stands             provide superior habitats.  Much more uncertain, however, are                   understandings about the economic implications of mixed-species rather          than single-species management practices, and almost not attention has          been focused on how to reconcile both economic and ecological                   approaches.  This project will consist of an application of modern              stock-portfolio theory to problems of mixed-species stand management.           Special attention will be given to assessing the degree to which stock-         portfolio management practices can integrate financial risk-aversion and        biological diversity considerations in commercial forest management             practices.  Theoretical developments will be tested using a mathematical        programming model of the Blodgett Forest Research Station in the Sierra         Nevada of California to evaluate the range of opportunities for economic        risk reduction through species diversification.                                    This project will provide valuable new insights into procedures for          integrating advanced financial analysis procedures and ecological               consideration into management of natural resources.  In addition to its         focused and theoretical contributions, it will demonstrate the potential        for research that seriously addresses major problems using both social          scientific and natural scientific perspectives.",
