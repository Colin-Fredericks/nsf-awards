 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small halogenated methane, ethylene, and phosphorous compounds                  in the gas-phase will be illuminated with tunable vacuum                        ultraviolet radiation and X-rays at several synchrotron                         radiation facilities.  X-ray absorption excites and/or ionizes                  core electrons, eventually producing unstable doubly charged                    ions which readily fragment into ion pairs.  Ion-ion                            coincidence experiments will detect ion pairs resulting from                    single and multiple bond rupture of the doubly charged species.                 Results will help elucidate variations in molecular fragment-                   ation patterns induced by site-selective core electron excita-                  tion as a function of molecule size, halogen substitution, and                  excitation wavelength.  This planning grant will provide funds                  for equipment, faculty and undergraduate research salaries,                     travel to synchrotron radiation facilities for collaborative                    experiments, and publication costs.  During the grant period,                   setup and construction of the experimental apparatus at                         Carleton College will be nearly completed and will involve                      undergraduate research students.  An in-lab electron gun used                   to simulate x-rays will be purchased and utilized to assemble                   and test the time-of-flight ion mass spectrometer.  Collabo-                    ration with a colleague on experiments similar to those listed                  above will keep Dr. Ferrett involved with new experiments in                    her field while providing needed expertise in ion coincidence                   techniques.                                                                     %%%                                                                             Research Planning Grants enable women who have not had prior                    independent Federal research support to develop a competitive                   research project.  This project involves the simultaneous                       detection of ions resulting from decomposition of larger doubly                 charged ions thus providing critical information about the                      nature of events taking place after site selective core                         electron excitation.",
