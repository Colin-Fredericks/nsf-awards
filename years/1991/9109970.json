 "awd_abstract_narration": "In nature, there are advantages of sociality (increased food               gathering potential, protection from predators), yet there are                  also costs of the social environment (increased competition for                 food and/or space, potential for spread of parasites and                        diseases, increased visibility to predators).  Not all animals                  within a colony or social group experience these benefits and/or                costs equally.  For example, animals on the edge of colonies may                be at greater risk of predation from their natural enemies, while               others in the center may face greater competition for food.  Dr.                Uetz's research is directed at understanding how animals make                   decisions (live alone or in a group; change location within a                   colony, etc.), and how the cumulative effects of those decisions                affect survival and  reproductive success.  The studies concern                 spacing behavior, and how location of spiders within three-                     dimensional web colonies affects the balance between feeding                    success and predation risk.  Using this information, Dr. Uetz                   will develop a mathematical model to  predict the optimal                       decision-making strategies yielding the best chance of survival                 and reproductive success.                                                            The evolution of social behavior has received much                         attention, and scientists continue to examine the costs and                     benefits of group-living in light of natural selection theory.                  This topic arouses both interest and controversy, because of the                diversity of social behaviors observed in animals, and because                  humans as well are social.  This research will contribute to                    growing knowledge of how costs and benefits of behavioral                       strategies shape the evolution of animal societies, and also                    provide insight into how social behavior can evolve in typically                asocial animals such as spiders.",
