 "awd_abstract_narration": "The deepening economic crises in Eastern Europe and the Soviet                  Union and the economic stagnation in China, have political causes               and consequences that contemporary political science is ill                     equipped to analyze.  Few of the most powerful theories developed               for western regimes apply in the former eastern bloc nations.  Area             studies experts are theoretically uninformed and know too little                about either political economy or systematic research methods.                                                                                                  This research training workshop attempts to remedy this situation               by bringing together some of the Soviet area specialists,                       democratic theorists, and research methodologists for a series of               intensive sessions.  The senior participants will benefit from the              interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and participating graduate                  students will have an unusual opportunity to work with and                      synthesize the ideas of the leaders in the field.",
