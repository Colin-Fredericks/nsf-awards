 "awd_abstract_narration": "The bird adrenal gland is capable of synthesizing several                       cortisone-like hormones.  One of these is responsible for the                   regulation of certain aspects of carbohydrate metabolism in the                 organism, while another acts on the kidney to ensure proper salt                and water balance.  Cells isolated from the gland respond to                    incubation media containing the pituitary hormone, corticotropin                by producing the two types of cortisone-like hormone.  The cells                also respond to incubation media containing a hormone called                    angiotensin II.  Under these circumstancs, they produce relatively              large amounts of the salt- and water regulating hormone, but none               of the carbohydrate-regulating hormone.  These effects of                       corticotropin and angiotensin II on isolated tissue samples                     simulate the responses of the adrenal gland in organisms subjected              to stress and diets containing different levels of salts.  Until                a few years ago, it was assumed that the secretion of these                     hormones was controlled exclusively by corticotropin and                        angiotensin II but evidence has recently accumulated to indicate                that factors of neural origin may also act, to regulate the                     synthesis and release of adrenal steroid hormones. Nerve cells                  terminating in the adrenal gland contain, and may secrete, a                    variety of polypeptides, in addition to the typical adrenalin-like              hormones.  The proposed studies will contribute to our                          understanding of the ways in which regulators derived from nerve                cells influence the overall control of adrenal steroid hormone                  synthesis.  The experimental model will be the developing adrenal               gland in the duck embryo.  Through the use of the latest                        ultrastructural, histochemical and immunocytochemical techiques                 the nature, the loci and the distribution of the adrenalin-like and             peptide factors will be investigated.  At the same time the                     functional development and responsiveness of the adrenal                        steroidogenic cells during embryonic development will be assessed               in terms of their secretory and synthetic properties.                                                                                                           Since the hormones produced by the adrenal gland are absolutely                 essential to the survival of all vertebrates, including Man, it is              important to understand the nature of the control mechanisms                    involved in the regulation of this important endocrine gland.                   Also, knowledge of how these glands function in birds is not only               of fundamental interest to the biologist, it is also important to               society in general, for birds constitute an important source of                 food for many millions of people around the world.//",
