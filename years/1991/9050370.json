 "awd_abstract_narration": "Separation processes based upon the scientific principles of                    adsorption are becoming increasingly important in the chemical                  industry.  On the other hand, current treatment of the                          thermodynamic fundamentals and process principles of adsorption                 is inadequate or non-existent in many core chemical engineering                 undergraduate curricula and textbooks.  The specific aims of this               project are to introduce these topics into our core undergraduate               courses, and to establish associated laboratories.  Such                        introduction is particularly facilitated by our core curricular                 structure, wherein one full course considers the fundamentals of                phase equilibria and another the principles of separation                       processes.  Each of these classes has a laboratory course                       integrated with it, which the students take during the same                     semester they register for the lecture classes.  A volumetric                   adsorption apparatus and a pressure swing adsorption apparatus                  (PSA) will be constructed to be included in these laboratories.                 No major pieces of equipment are requested.  The nature of the                  experiments requires that the apparatuses by constructed rather                 than purchased.  The students will be exposed to several new                    concepts peculiar to this subject, which must be learnt for the                 successful industrial practice of adsorption related phenomena.",
