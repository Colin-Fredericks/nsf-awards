 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to devise formal methodologies for            the design and analysis of self-stabilizing, distributed systems.  The          ability to react to unforeseen external perturbations is a fundamental          stability criterion of any intelligent distributed system.  Transient           failures affect the global state of a system in an unpredictable                manner.  A distributed system is called self-stabilizing when,                  regardless of its initial state, the system is guaranteed to recover            to a legitimate configuration in a finite number of steps.  In the              context of fault-tolerance, the concept of self-stabilization is of             fundamental importance.  However, many of the currently known self-             stabilizing systems are hand-crafted.  Much work needs to be done in            consolidating the design of self-stabilization algorithms and devising          formal methodologies, before these principles can be applied to the             design of non-trivial systems.  The proposed research will explore              methods for the design of non-trivial, self-stabilizing systems on              different interconnection topologies and investigate potential                  applications in the design of fault-tolerant distributed systems.",
