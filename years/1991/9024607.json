 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fixed ended beam is subjected to a short pulse of transverse                  loading such that plastic deformations are imposed.  Because of the             end fixity, dynamic instabilities related to shallow arch action                may occur.  Anomalous phenomena (such a final deflections in the                direction opposite that of the pulse and severe difficulty of                   prediction) have been studied in uniform beams (by finite element               analysis) and in two-and single-degree of freedom special beam                  models.  In the first two of these cases, indications of                        deterministic chaos appear.  Their novelty and interest lie in                  their appearance with workless constraints and in the absence of                harmonic or other sustained excitation.  Research is proposed here              which aims to confirm and amplify the preliminary results already               obtained (outlined in the proposal), to gain deeper understanding               by further analysis and extensions, and to provide methods for the              estimation of parameter ranges in which they are likely to occur.",
