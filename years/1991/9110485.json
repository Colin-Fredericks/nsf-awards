The NCES, IPEDS data will provide the National Science                   Foundation (NSF), an essential portion of the statistics needed to              give a comprehensive base of knowledge on undergraduate education.              IPEDS is a system by which data are collected from all institutions             and educational organizations whose primary purpose is to provide               postsecondary education.  IPEDS collects much of the information                that is needed from baccalaureate or higher institutions, and it is             the only source of comprehensive data from two-year award                       institutions.  This current proposal will allow the Foundation to               acquire at an early date, edited detailed data for each                         postsecondary institution.",
