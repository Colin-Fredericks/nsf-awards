 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for a two-year pilot study of an innovative                       instrumental technique to obtain precise radial velocities of                   stars.  The technique is to insert a recently constructed container             filled with iodine gas in beam of a coude spectrometer at McDonald              Observatory.  This gas will absorb starlight at well known                      wavelengths, thereby providing a set of calibration lines                       interspersed with the stellar lines in the spectrum.  With this                 innovation, the PI expects to obtain radial velocities to an                    accuracy of +-5 m/sec (roughly 8 mph).  He will then obtain a time              series of spectra for several bright red giant stars and search for             pulsations in them.   The PI has already used a related                         instrumental technique to verfify the existence of a 1.8-day period             in the red giant Arcturus.  If this pulsation in Arcturus is                    typical of other red giants, then a new class of variable stars                 will have been discovered.  The data will be used for a variety of              other astrophysical purposes, including the study of convective                 circulation cells and magnetic \"activity\" on these stars surfaces.              Either pulsations, magnetic activity, or both of these phenomena,               could be responsible for heating the outer atmospheres                          (\"chromospheres\") of red giants.  Chromospheres, in turn, are                   thought to cause a mass loss, which can significantly affect the                subsequent history of the star's evolution.",
