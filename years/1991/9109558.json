 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase information has largely been neglected in robust                          control theory but is essential for maximizing                                  achievable performance in controlling complex                                   multivariable systems.  Phase information, here, refers                         to the characterization of the phase of the modeling                            uncertainty in the frequency domain.  Real parameter                            uncertainty modeling in the time domain provides                                phase information in the frequency domain.  The                                 objective is to develop effective methods for utilizing                         phase information in the analysis and design of robust                          controllers.  A proposal is made to study numerous                              interrelated ideas that are relevant to phase properties                        of dynamical systems in general and feedback control                            systems in particular.  Although quadratic Lyapunov                             functions provide the foundation for much robust                                control theory, connections with small-gain (H-infinity)                        theory illustrate limitations of this approach in the                           presence of phase information.  Extensions of quadratic                         Lyapunov functions, such as parameter-dependent                                 Lyapunov functions, and structured Lyapunov functions                           are some of the ideas being proposed to overcome                                these limitations.  Also proposed, is to establish a                            theoretical foundation of robust stabilization with                             positive real uncertainty.  Recent Riccati-based                                robustness results for positive real uncertainty obtained                       by the author form the starting point for these                                 investigations.  Finally, it is proposed to generalize                          classical frequency-domain stability criteria, such as the                      Popov and circle criteria, to state-space controller                            synthesis using a Riccati equation approach.  This                              development will provide the necessary tools for                                controller synthesis for sector-bounded nonlinearities.                         This research will provide a new approach to robust                             stabilization--one that involves phase information that                         can be significantly less conservative than an H-infinity                       small-gain approach.",
