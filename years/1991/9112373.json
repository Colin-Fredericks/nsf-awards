 "awd_abstract_narration": "New experiments at millimeter wave frequencies have                             shown important nonlinear effects using specially                               developed materials.  In each case the observations                             have been relatively difficult with the available                               materials and power densities.  At shorter                                      wavelengths these nonlinear effects become                                      significantly larger and more amenable to study.  One                           of our more novel experiments involves phase                                    conjugation, an important and useful area of research                           at visible wavelengths, which had not been achieved                             at longer wavelengths.  Using an artificial Kerr                                medium we were able to demonstrate four wave                                    mixing and phase conjugation in waveguides.  The use                            of higher frequencies will permit the crucial extension                         of this concept to free space.  Another set of                                  experiments uses high temperature superconductor                                films to make unique, tunable quasi-optical filters.                            The properties we are studying, involving                                       concentrations of paired superconducting electrons,                             will be much more sensitive to applied laser fields                             when observed at the submillimeter frequencies.  This                           NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant will                                   therefore be used to purchase an optically pumped                               molecular gas laser system which will generate CW                               Submillimeter and Far Infrared radiation.  In                                   addition to opening up an entire range of new                                   experiments in nonlinear effects and superconducting                            structures, this work will have important applications                          in remote sensing and communications.",
