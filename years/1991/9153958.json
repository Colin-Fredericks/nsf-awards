Each middle                     school project will be visited by a researcher who will                         carry out an in-depth study of the project, collect and                         archive materials from the project, and prepare a case-                         study report describing the site.  A set of common issues                       and questions will be examined across all sites, and                            researchers will be encouraged to pursue additional topics                      specific to each site.  Researchers will explore the                            development of each project, its successes and                                  accomplishments, and the difficulties experienced and                           lessons learned.  A repository will be established to                           archive the collected materials from all the sites, and the                     site visit reports will be incorporated into a document                         which will be widely disseminated to mathematics and                            science educators.   This document and archived materials                       will provide a mechanism for the middle school projects to                      influence teacher preparation practice throughout the                           country.",
