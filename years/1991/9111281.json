 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the post-flame gases of an incinerator metal vapors begin                    to condense as the temperature drops.  The more volatile meals                  tend to be concentrated in smaller particles or aerosols which                  can also be the most difficult to control.  The objective of                    the proposed research is to study the morphology of metal                       emissions in the effluent of a research incinerator and                         determine if controlled seeding of the flow with inorganic                      particles of a specific size and composition can accelerate                     nucleation and condensation of lead, cadmium, and mercury onto                  these particles.  The particles will be of size that can be                     removed using current effluent treatment technologies.  In                      this experimental study, liquids containing metals will be                      incinerated.  Inorganic particles will be added to the post-                    flame combustion gases downstream of the flame zone.  A                         portion of the particulates will then be trapped further                        downstream and the metals concentrations measured using an                      atomic absorption spectrometer.  The adsorption                                 characteristics of each metal onto the particulates will be                     determined as a function of the particle composition, the size                  of the injected particles, and the loading.                                                                                                                     Public and governmental concern is increasing over emissions                    of heavy metals from municipal and hazardous waste                              incinerators.  The rates of metal recovery found in this                        research program may point to a promising commercial recovery                   technique.",
