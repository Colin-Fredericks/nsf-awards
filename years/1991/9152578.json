 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides Electrical Engineering Technology                         undergraduate students with a low cost and modern approach to                   laboratory instrumentation, circuit and system design.  This                    laboratory facility allows the students to quickly access                       hardware and software programs so they can do both analysis and                 design of circuits and systems.  Analog-to-digital and digital-                 to-analog converters and software added to the personal                         computers allow the students to build complex systems,                          concentrating on the principles.  Because of the flexibility,                   the system can be customized to suit investigative and/or                       educational problems. With powerful software design tools and                   interface hardware students design, simulate, and test circuits                 and systems from the workstation.  The equipment allows                         electrical engineering technology students to design and                        analyze systems with the same operating technology as their                     industrial counterparts, and learn industry standard operations                 and practices.",
