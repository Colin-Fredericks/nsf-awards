 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ImmC and ImmI regions of the closely related, but heteroimmune,             phages P1 and P7 code for regulatory proteins involved in directing             the phage toward lytic or lysogenic growth.  Within ImmC, c1 codes              for a repressor of lytic gene expression, while coi codes for an                antagonist of c1 repressor activity.  The c4 repressor, encoded                 within ImmI, prevents expression of ant, a closely linked gene                  whose product interferes with c1-mediated repression.  Differences              in c4 specificity are responsible for the heteroimmune character                of P1 and P7.  Regulation of gene expression within ImmC and ImmI               will be investigated by monitoring the expression of lacZ from                  transcriptional fusions in the presence of compatible plasmids                  coding for phage regulatory proteins.  The regulatory role played               by multiple c1 operator sites within ImmC will be investigated by               in vitro mutagenesis and DNase protection studies.  Mutations in                c1 that suppress the virulent phenotype caused by Coi                           overproduction will also be sought.  The contribution to                        heteroimmune specificity of sequence differences within P1ImmI and              P7 ImmI will be investigated by assaying the effect of c4 and ant               expression on transcription within these regions, and within the                downstream region containing the lytic replicon.//",
