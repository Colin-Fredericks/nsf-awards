 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wyoming will conduct the High school                          Teachers Engineering Program (HISTEP), a three week,                            residential summer program beginning in 1991.  This three                       year program is designed to help recruit students for                           engineering careers by enhancing the capabilities and                           enthusiasm of mathematics and science teachers.                                                                                                                 HISTEP provides thirty high school mathematics, chemistry,                      and physics teachers with the opportunity to explore                            engineering applications in a laboratory setting.  The                          laboratory sessions offer both enrichment opportunities for                     experienced, enthusiastic teachers and opportunities to                         expand subject matter content for less well-prepared                            teachers.  The teachers will build a digital circuit, smash                     timber trusses, and design with computer assistance, all                        engineering applications which directly relate to topics                        typically covered in high school mathematics, physics, and                      chemistry courses.                                                                                                                                              The engineering faculty conducting the laboratory sessions                      will participate in a learning strategy seminar, and will                       apply these teaching methodologies to their laboratory                          sessions.  Faculty knowledgeable in effective science                           teaching practices will conduct the seminars, and will also                     assist the participants in developing instructional                             materials for their classrooms.                                                                                                                                 The sessions will enhance the teachers' creative thinking                       and problem solving skills and establish an appreciation for                    the role of science in our society, consequently benefiting                     both technically oriented students and those pursuing                           nontechnical careers.  The sessions, covering a wide variety                    of scientific topics with a significant level of                                participation, are intended to create a high level of                           interest among the participants.  The diversity of the                          program provides a unique, and stimulating, experience for                      professional growth.                                                                                                                                            The participants will conduct workshops/demonstrations for                      colleagues in their school district and for parent groups.                      The engineering faculty from the Wyoming community colleges                     are available for assistance with the workshops.                                                                                                                HISTEP participants will attend an annual meeting where they                    will have an opportunity to discuss the implementation of                       their summer activities, their successes, their failures,                       and the assessment data on their students' problem solving                      skills.
