 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Monterey Bay Aquarium's educational programs model hands-on,                process-based science teaching, which is called \"Wet Science\".  The             Wet Science Project is designed to improve the scientific literacy of           7th to 12th grade teachers, strengthen their science-teaching skills,           and develop support systems for hands-on science in their districts.            This project will train 120 teachers from 13 school districts.  With            each participant conducting one in-service for ten colleagues, a total          of 1200 teachers and their students will be reached.  The project               duration is 36 months, and the cost sharing is 33 percent of the                amount requested for the National Science Foundation.                                                                                                           The project consists of five levels of teacher enhancement.  The                participants will learn science and wet-science teaching, study                 upper-division marine ecology, conduct field research, develop                  curriculum, and learn student research management, science education            promotion, multi-disciplinary team building, and adult teaching skills.         The participants will form teams to transform their wet-science                 experiences into classroom of field-trip experiences for students and           colleagues.  Together with their school administrators, the                     participants will integrate wet science into district goals, curriculum         and programs, and disseminate wet science to other school districts,            aquariums, and zoos.",
