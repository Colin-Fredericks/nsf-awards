 "awd_abstract_narration": "C3 plays a critical role in complement activation due to its                    ability to bind to other complement proteins, and interact with                 several cell surface receptors.  The elucidation of the molecular               features related to these C3 associated functions requires further              analysis of its structure.  The goal of this project is to analyze              the structure and functions of C3 from two phylogenetically key                 species, the chicken and the lamprey, and to compare and correlate              this information with what is known about mammalian C3 in order to              further our understanding of this molecule.  At the protein level,              the objectives will be to purify C3 from the plasma of chickens and             lampreys and test their ability to react with human complement                  proteins CR1, CR2, CR3, C5, H, B, I, and P as well as with                      autologous complement receptors.  Previously established                        purification procedures will be used.  The binding of C3-binding                proteins to C3 from the two species will be analyzed by direct                  binding ELISA, by binding to C3 fragment-coated erythrocytes, and               by inhibition assays.  Amino acid sequences for the different C3s               will be obtained by sequencing proteolytic fragments of C3 .  In                order to obtain N-terminal amino acid sequences of fragments                    generated by autologous C3 convertases and factor I (in the                     presence of H), serum of the two species will be activated by                   zymosan, the zymosan bound C3 fragments will be eluted, separated               by SDS-PAGE, and then blotted to PVDF membranes.  The different C3              fragments will be sequenced directly from the PVDF membranes.  The              presence of carbohydrates and thiolester bonds will also be                     determined.  Oligonucleotide probes constructed from the determined             amino acid sequences, cDNA probes or affinity purified anti-C3                  antibodies will be used to screen lambda gt11 cDNA liver libraries              to obtain complete primary structure for the various C3s. (Lambda               gt11 cDNA liver libraries from the two species have been prepared               already, and four candidate clones for chicken C3 have been                     isolated thus far.)  The obtained sequences will be compared and                correlated to functional data.  Of special interest are the C3                  segments known to mediate the binding of C3-binding proteins.                                                                                                   The interaction of the protein, \"C3\", with other plasma proteins                and with several cell surface receptors make it a key participant               in phagocytic and immunoregulatory processes involved in animal                 defense mechanisms.  Preliminary experiments suggest that it is                 possible to identify the structural features of C3 that are                     important for its functions by comparing the C3 amino acid                      sequences between species, and correlating this information with                the ability of these C3s to bind to different C3-binding proteins.              The proposed studies, in addition to providing new information on               the phylogenetic history of C3, will provide basic information on               how the structural features of C3 relate to its multiple functions.",
