 "awd_abstract_narration": "Classification schemes for living organisms have predictive                value when they reflect evolutionary relatedness based on genetic               or genomic features of the organisms' DNA.  Dr. John Taylor of                  the University of California at Berkeley is studying the                        evolutionary or phylogenetic relationships of select groups of                  fungi, using DNA analyses to measure mutational differences among               species and to compare these results against morphological data.                The work employs the new method of polymerase chain reaction DNA                amplification, which permits analysis of DNA from as little as a                single fungal spore.  The information obtained about fungal DNA                 allows inference about genealogical relationships, and also                     provides the foundation for extremely rapid and accurate                        identification of fungal samples.                                                    Dr. Taylor is focusing this work on the fungal genus                       Penicillium, important both biologically and economically.  Some                species manufacture food and some make the beneficial mycotoxin,                penicillin.  Penicillium species also rot food and feed.                        Identification of these fungi and predictions about their                       metabolic activities are important to the food, pharmaceutical,                 agricultural, and medical industries.  Penicillium and its                      associated sexual forms classified in the genus Talaromyces                     present fundamental problems in classification and phylogeny                    because persistent morphs in nature may reproduce only asexually.               Morphological features are usually inadequate for associating                   closely related sexual and asexual forms into a coherent and                    natural scheme of lineages.  The DNA methods are powerful tools                 for resolving this difficulty, because both forms contain similar               genomes amenable to amplification and phylogenetic analysis.",
