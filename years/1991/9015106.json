 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Ilan Benjamin is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                  and Computational Chemistry Program to perform molecular                        dynamics simulations of chemical reactions at liquid                            interfaces.  This is fundamentally important since in many                      chemical systems the interesting and relevant chemistry occurs                  at the interface between two immiscible liquids, at the                         liquid-solid interface, or at the liquid-vapor interface.                                                                                                       Dr. Benjamin plans to study the effect of the media on chemical                 reactions which occur at the interface between a liquid and its                 vapor, and at the interface between two immiscible liquids.                     The method of molecular dynamics computer simulation will be                    used to find how the unique characteristics of the interface                    affect the equilibrium properties of a chemically reactive                      system, such as the solvation free energy, the equilibrium                      constant, the activation free energy and thus the transition-                   state-theory rate constant.  A major part of the study will use                 non-equilibrium molecular dynamics to investigate the influence                 of the solvent on time-dependent properties of the chemically                   reactive species at the interface.  This includes energy decay,                 barrier crossings, solvent fluctuations caused by the presence                  of the solute and their effects on the rate of reaction.",
