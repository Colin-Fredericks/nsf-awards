 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program continues a successful existing program into the                    study of organized, multimolecular assemblies of surfactant                     molecules.  Chemical composition, physical structure and the                    extent of organization of these assemblies will be                              investigated.  The project aims to measure the fluidity of                      synthetic phospholipid bilayers as a function of phospholipid                   structure and surface concentration; to characterize the effect                 of cholesterol on the membrane fluidity and studies that may                    lead to a cholesterol sensor; to investigate the electron                       hopping and proton diffusion in these assemblies; and to                        develop chiral selectivity and gating properties at electrode                   surfaces using monolayer films.                                                                                                                                 %%%                                                                                                                                                             The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                     Chemistry, focuses on studies of the dynamics of lateral                        processes in monolayers and bilayers at interfaces.   The                       research is intended to mimic the structures and functions of                   biological membrane systems.   The project continues an                         important program aimed at developing new methods for the study                 of model membrane systems at solid-solution and air-water                       interfaces.  The outcome of the research will be important not                  only in our understanding of electrochemistry and thin films,                   but will also have considerable importance in the understanding                 of membrane action in biological systems.",
