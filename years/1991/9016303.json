 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fourier analysis is a flourishing and vibrant mathematical                 field.  It is a core subject in mathematics because its central                 purpose is to understand analysis on a geometric manifold and the               oscillatory behavior of phenomena characterizing the manifold.  The             direction and emphasis of much research over the past few years has             been placed on applications of ideas from Fourier analysis to other             areas of analysis, including applied mathematics, differential                  geometry, dynamical systems, mathematical physics, partial                      differential equations, probability and several complex variables.              New advances continue to be made in research aimed toward                       understanding basic problems related to maximal functions,                      multiplier operators and singular integrals which are at the heart              of Fourier analysis.                                                                 This grant will support a conference in Fourier Analysis to be             held May 13 -17, 1991 at Princeton University.  This conference                 will draw leading analysts from all over the world, many who were               associated with developing the field.  Many young researchers will              also attend, and the conference should have a strong influence on               the research developments of the next generation of mathematicians.",
