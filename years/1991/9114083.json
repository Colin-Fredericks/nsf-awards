 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to explore the potential for linking mid-Miocene                paleoclimate and horse evolution by establishing the systematics                of trace elemental and isotopic preservation in the bone and tooth              phosphate of North American fossil horses.  We will test whether                enamel phosphate provides quantitative information about changes                in paleoenvironment (temperature, hydrology), paleodiet (graze vs.              browse), and evolution (the mid-Miocene radiation of horses), or                if bone and tooth phosphate is diagenetically opaque.  This                     preliminary work could catalyze new avenues for unraveling Miocene              continental paleoclimate changes, an important period of global                 climatic deterioration with scant quantitative paleogeochemical                 information from continental records.                                                Fossil horses are particularly suitable for study because they             are geographically widespread and common in fossil assemblages from             the Eocene to late Pleistocene and have modern analogues.  Horses               underwent an explosive adaptive radiation and presumed dietary                  shift in the middle Miocene (16-12 Ma) perhaps responding to                    paleoclimatic changes and the spread of savannah grasslands.  This              climatic shift is inferred from paleoceanographic data; the dietary             shift, from studies of the functional morphology of teeth.  We wish             to determine if a paleodietary shift is evident in the chemistry                of the fossil teeth; if the continental paleoclimate record                     corroborates the marine record in magnitude, direction, and timing;             and if paleoclimatic change occurred concurrently with                          paleoenvironmental and evolutionary changes.  In this preliminary               venture, we will explore the effects of diagenesis, inter- and                  intraspecific variations, and characterize the del 18Opo4 of fossil             horse teeth and bones from the Burge Quarry, one of the richest and             best-preserved middle Miocene (-12 Ma) horse faunas.  Diagenesis                will be evaluated with trace element, SEM, and XRD analyses of                  enamel phosphate and compared to modern horses.  If diagenesis                  proves to be negligible, del 18Opo4 of tooth-enamel in modern and               fossil teeth will establish the suitability of reconstructing the               continental paleoclimate record.",
