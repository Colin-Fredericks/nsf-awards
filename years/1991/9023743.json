 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Elvin T. Choong,                     Professor of  Forestry, Louisiana State University, to pursue                   with Dr. Suminar S. Achmadi, Lecturer in Chemistry, Bogor                       Agricultural University, Indonesia, for a period of 24                          months, a program of cooperative research on the chemistry of                   mangrove bark tannins.  An acetone-water solution will be                       used to extract tannins from the bark of Bruguiera sp. and                      Rhizophora sp. - tree species from mangrove forests of                          Indonesia.  The crude tannin extracts will be fractionated,                     and the fractions will be characterized for structure,                          molecular weight distribution, and identification of                            constituent compounds.  These compounds will be further                         studied for potential uses as specialty chemicals.                                                                                                              The mangrove forests of Southeast Asia constitute a huge                        renewable resource of wood and bark.  With proper management,                   this resource could be exploited without affecting its                          essential role in estuary ecology.  Indonesia contains 20% of                   the world's mangrove forests.  The bark from mangrove trees                     is an important source of tannins which are used for                            leather manufacture and preservative treatment of cloth.                        Mangrove bark is also the source of reactive phenols which                      are useful in a wide variety of specialty chemical                              applications.  The collaborators will isolate, characterize,                    and identify tannins from mangrove trees.  The U.S. and                         Indonesian collaborators have a record of successful                            collaboration in the field of the proposal.  This project is                    relevant to  the objectives of the Science in Developing                        Countries Program which seeks to increase the level of                          cooperation between U.S. and developing country scientists                      and engineers through the exchange of scientific information,                   ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on                      problems of mutual benefit.",
