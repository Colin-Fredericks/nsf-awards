 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative project is proposed to produce illustrated keys to              enable identification of all genera of Chalcidoidea (a large group              of parasitic wasps) known from North America including temperate                areas of Mexico.  The Chalcidoidea are one of the largest groups                of wasps, containing about 16,000 described species.  Because all               species are parasites of other insects, they are of great                       importance to agriculture as natural enemies of insect pests and                of fundamental importance in ecological systems as regulators of                plant-feeding insects.  However, adequate keys to identify genera               presently do not exist for most of the twenty families present in               the region.  Seventeen scientists have made formal commitments to               participate in this project and each family is covered by one or                more contributors.  Agreements on scope, content and format of the              project was reached at a workshop held in 1989.  The approach will              be a pragmatic synthesis of available information using current                 concepts of genera and higher taxa (families and subfamilies).                  The output will be a single manual.  Introductory chapters will                 include a key to chalcidoid families and a section on anatomical                terms explaining the uniform terminology to be used throughout the              manual.  The keys will use an annotated format to provide                       information on distributions, numbers of species, and hosts when                practical for each genus.  A second planning workshop is proposed               for integration of the chapters and hands-on testing of draft keys              by all participants.  The resulting manual will enable many                     biologists to identify Neartic chalcidoids to genus and will vastly             facilitate this task for systematics.",
