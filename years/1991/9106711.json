 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shelah's classification theory assigns to each                             \"classifiable\" structure a system of homogeneous combinatorial                  geometries, represented by regular types.  One of the fundamental               ideas of geometric stability theory is a trichotomy between                     geometries of combinatorial, linear, and geometric type.  A                     satisfying structure theory exists in the linear domain, for the                geometries themselves and the structures they coordinatize.  The                regular types of the third type are very poorly understood; until               recently they were believed to consist entirely of algebraic                    geometry objects (in finite rank), but a series of constructions                has shown the class to be much larger.  The research undertaken                 here will attempt to create a map of the nonlinear strongly                     minimal sets.  One goal is Cherlin's conjecture, that aleph-one-                categorical groups are simple algebraic groups over algebraically               closed fields.  In another direction, there are indications that                the geometric trichotomy is valid beyond the existing borders of                stability theory.  The investigator hopes to extend these                       borders, creating a theory of forking, regular types, and the                   parallel of the linear theory, for a class of structures that                   includes all the classical geometries (projective, unitary,                     orthogonal, symplectic) among its (linear) regular types.  This                 would have applications to pseudo-finite structures and possible                interactions with finite group theory.                                               One of the remarkable things about this research area is                   that it shows that a great deal of information about algebraic                  structures can be obtained from intensive study of the                          mathematical language in which one deals with them.  Shelah,                    Hrushovski, and others have pushed this model-theoretic approach                much further in recent years than most people previously thought                possible.",
