 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop a formal framework for the          specification and analysis of real-time systems, and tools to support           them.  Since the correctness of a real-time system depends on not only          how concurrent processes interact but also the time at which these              interactions occur, the formal framework must be capable of modeling            delays due to process synchronization as well as contention for shared          resources.  While most current real-time models capture delays due to           process synchronization, they abstract out resource-specific details            by assuming idealistic operating environments.  On the other hand,              scheduling and resource allocation algorithms used for real-time                systems ignore the effect of process synchronization except for simple          precedence relations between processes.  To bridge the gap between              these two disciplines, a specification language called Communicating            Shared Resources (CSR), and a priority-based process algebra called             the Calculus for Communicating Shared Resources (CCSR) are being                developed.  CSR supports the high-level description of real-time                systems, whereas CCSR provides the resource-based computation model of          CSR and a prioritized strong equivalence for terms based on strong              bisimulation.  Based on CCSR's formal framework, three tools to                 analyze process behavior will be developed: a simulator, a model                checker and a mechanical theorem prover.  The tools will be integrated          in a single analyzer to be used at different stages of proving that a           specification is correct.",
