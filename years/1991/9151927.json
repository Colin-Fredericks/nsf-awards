 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of the Alma College Biochemistry Department is to                  provide well equipped facilities to teach undergraduate                         students modem techniques in biochemistry and molecular                         genetics.  The goal of this project is to introduce                             fluorescence spectroscopy into the undergraduate biochemistry                   laboratory as a powerful analytical tool. The requested                         instrumentation provides rapid and sensitive detection of                       molecular events allowing investigation into areas of                           biochemistry that complement current methodology and                            instrumentation available in the laboratory as well as                          reinforce the lecture portions of the courses offered in the                    department.   The introductory biochemistry, advanced                           biochemistry, and molecular genetics courses offered by the                     biochemistry department will use the fluorescence                               spectrophotometer and supporting equipment.  We will study                      protein-ligand interactions, enzyme kinetics, and protein                       denaturation kinetics; to investigate properties of liposomes,                  living cells, and biological membranes; to quantitate small                     amounts of nucleic acids; and to probe protein-nucleic acid                     interactions. In addition to its role in the classroom                          experience, the fluorescence spectrophotometer will also                        enhance student research opportunities that Alma College                        provides its students. The instrumentation will significantly                   enhance the biochemistry laboratory experience and will provide                 students with a powerful technique that is underutilized in the                 undergraduate biochemistry laboratory presently.",
