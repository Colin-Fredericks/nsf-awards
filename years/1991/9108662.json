 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project involves the dissertation research of a                   graduate student in ethno-botanical anthropology who will study                 how members of a Mayan Indian community in southern Mexico select               medicinal plants.  The project, based on participant observation,               field surveys for plants, structured interviewing and                           lexicographic techniques, represents an in-depth study of the                   information Mayan Indians need to identify medicinal plants.  The               researcher will collect medicinal plants with expert Mayan                      Indians, questioning them as they select (and reject) plants for                their pharmacological efficacy.  In addition expert Indian plant                collectors will be asked to define the characteristics of an                    already collected set of medicinal plants.  The end result will                 be an in-depth analysis of the cognitive as well as botanical                   aspects of Mayan Indian medicinal plant use.  The dissertation                  research is in collaboration with other research on the                         ethnomedicine of Indians in this area, and will contribute to and               benefit from this other research.                                                                                                                               This research is important because understanding how people with                a vibrant natural system of medicinal plant use select plants for               specific illnesses will advance our knowledge of basic human                    cognition about health care, and of the medicinal attributes of                 plants in this area.  Recording and preserving indigenous                       ethnobotanical and ethnomedical knowledge is an important part of               preserving global biodiversity.",
