 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will be to carry out an analytical and                       experimental program to study a fractal-based representation of                 tolerances for discrete part manufacturing processes.  A fractal-               based representation does not replace the current view of tolerance             control in engineering design and manufacturing.  Instead, such a               representation extends current tolerance synthesis and analysis                 practices by providing a means of determining the physical                      interaction of the product design and manufacturing process                     variables.                                                                           A novel representation of the experimental data in terms of                Karhunen-Loeve expansion will be developed as a means of studying               the fractal or integral nature of shape profiles of the workpiece               specimens.  The experimental data and Karhunen-Loeve representation             will also supply information for comparisons with analytical models             of the manufacturing processes.",
