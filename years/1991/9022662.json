The research is                     concern with the development of theories of static and dynamic                  critical phenomena.  The goal is to develop accurate                            representatives of the thermodynamic and transport properties                   of fluid mixtures in the critical region which can be used for                  engineering applications such as the evaluation of                              thermodynamic cycles involving supercritical fluids, heat-                      transfer calculations in supercritical fluids, and evaluation                   of the performance of supercritical extraction process.  This                   project will involve three staff members at the Oil and Gas                     Research Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences and one                      staff member of the Grozny Oil Institute working at the                         University of Maryland.  This cooperative research will                         provide the US research group with a large amount of                            experimental information to test their theoretical results.                     One graduate student from the Maryland group will visit the                     Oil and Gas Research Institute and/or the Grozny Oil                            Institute.",
