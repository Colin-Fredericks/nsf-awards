 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working with Dr. Robert Nussbaum of the Dept. of Human                          Genomes Center at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Lindee                    is developing a research plan to understand modern eugenics.                    This plan includes a study of modern eugenics, 1950 to the                      present, which includes exploring the implications of the                       human genome project for future \"directed human evolution.\"                     She is trying to determine how concerns about human evolution                   have shaped the development of genetics.  By the end of the                     postdoctoral year, significant progress should have been made                   on a scholarly study of the problem.                                                                                                                            As part of the training under Dr. Nussbaum, Dr. Lindee is                       working with research geneticists in an intense laboratory                      apprenticeship.  She is also working with the Center staff in                   preparing for site visits, and will attend all administrative                   and scientific meetings of the Center.                                                                                                                          With the training and the research which she is undertaking                     under this fellowship, Dr. Lindee hopes to reshape the way                      historians, philosophers, and social scientists think about                     eugenics in America. Provocative recent work on German                          eugenics suggests some inadequacies of current American                         scholarship on this topic.  This work hopefully will open the                   field to more productive analysis.",
