 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the importance of dispersal to populations of                     patchily distributed species is critical to the fields of                       population ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation                      biology.  Dispersal can influence population fluctuations through               differences in immigration and emigration rates and, through gene               flow, can have a major influence on the genetic structure of                    populations.  In addition, the regional persistence of a species                prone to local extinction can depend on levels of dispersal high                enough to allow frequent recolonization of vacant habitat                       patches.  This area has a strong theoretical basis, but there has               been relatively little empirical research directed at answering                 the important questions.                                                                                                                                        This study examines the role of dispersal in the population                     dynamics and genetic structure of a patchily distributed                        butterfly species, Euphilotes enoptes.  The interplay of patch                  quality and isolation with the dynamics of local populations by                 coupling experiments with observations of individual behavior and               year-to-year population fluctuations will be studied.  Patch                    isolation and size will be related to gene flow and the                         allocation of genetic variability through a survey of mtDNA                     markers.  Finally, by studying two metapopulations, The                         generalizability of results from a single metapopulation of a                   species will be examined.",
