 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests renewed support for studies combining                    molecular immunology, protein chemistry and recombinant DNA                     technology to ascertain the properties of immunoglobulins of                    primitive vertebrate species and to identify and characterize the               genes specifying them with respect to rearranging elements                      (Variable, Diversity, Joining and Constant regions), the                        multiplicity of these elements, and their arrangement.  Future                  studies will focus on:  1) completion of the characterization of                the genes specifying light chains in the sandbar shark,                         Carcharhinus plumbeus; 2) characterization of the gene sequence and             arrangement for sandbar shark heavy chains, and 3) characterization             of cyclostome immunoglobulins and their genes.                                                                                                                  The immune response is a complex and precisely-regulated defense                mechanism that is present in all vertebrates.  Antibodies play a                major role in the vertebrate immune response.  The vast                         preponderance of biochemical and molecular genetic studies of                   antibodies have been carried out in man, mouse and rabbit, but very             few comparable studies have been carried out on primitive                       vertebrates.  The goal of this research is to provide new                       information on the rearranging elements of antibody genes in                    primitive vertebrate species, sandbar sharks and lampreys.  This                information will enhance our understanding of the origins of the                genetic events underlying the fundamental recognition and defense               mechanisms of the vertebrate immune system.",
