 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is central to development of a new                                 interdisciplinary course in global change for non-science                       students at Rhodes College.  The course is providing students                   with an understanding of the changes that are occurring that                    affect the Earth's environment, illustrating that the                           biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere all                          interact, on a global scale, to define this environment.                        Students are examining models, interpretations, measurements                    and physical principles used by scientists to study these                       global, interrelated problems.  This course and approach had                    been defined, over the last two years, by a group of university                 and college scientists and educators who were selected and                      sponsored by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.                      Rhodes is the liberal arts college test-case for the concept.A                  major emphasis of the project involves the use of system                        modeling software, a powerful pedagogical technique, to aid                     students in understanding complex systems. Since the students                   are mainly non-science majors, time is spent during the first                   weeks of the course teaching use of the computers and modeling                  software.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-                 federal sources.",
