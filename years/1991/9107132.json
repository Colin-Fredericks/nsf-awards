 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance of a vapor compression heat pump with desorber-                 absorber heat exchange (DAHX) is being studied experimentally.                  This cycle is the result of further development of the two-stage                concept currently under investigation with NSF support.  The DAHX-              cycle offers surprising features, such as extremely low pressure                ratios and a simple layout compared to its competitors.  It is                  especially advantageous that the proposed cycle requires less                   components and heat exchange area than the two-stage version                    currently investigated, achieving an even larger reduction in                   pressure ratio.  However, as a consequence of the simplification,               the operating characteristics show less flexibility.                                                                                                            This two-stage version is most likely to be used in high                        temperature lift industrial settings.  The DAHX-cycle is useful for             almost any heat pumping, refrigeration and air-conditioning                     situation, when large temperature glides and small lifts are                    encountered.  A variation of the DAHX-cycle within a vapor                      compression system, as it is proposed here, has never been built                before.  It is anticipated that the study of this cycle will reveal             interesting features and operational experience that will allow for             more creative and efficient vapor compression and combined                      absorption/vapor compression heat pumps in the future.  The DAHX-               cycle is expected to be easily tailored and optimized for a given               application.",
