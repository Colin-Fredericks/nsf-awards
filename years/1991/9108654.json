 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are: to help programmers formally                specify the interfaces of modules in the object-oriented programming            language C++, and to help programmers reason about the correctness of           programs that use message passing and inheritance.  Work on                     specification will involve designing and formally defining an                   interface specification language for C++, and testing the utility of            the specification language on several examples.  The specification              language, Larch/C++, will use subtype relationships and overloading             within assertions to specify polymorphic modules.  Work on                      verification will involve fundamental studies to understand properties          that specification language should be able to express.  These                   properties include relationships between specifications such as                 refinement and subtyping, how to use inheritance in specifications,             and ways to reason about mutation and aliasing.  While such studies             may eventually lead to formal methods for the verification of C++               programs, the emphasis will be on learning how to specify the                   properties that need to be proved.  The project would promote the               reuse of designs and program modules, and would help guide reasoning            about C++ programs.  The techniques developed would also be applicable          to other object-oriented languages.",
