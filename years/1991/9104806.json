 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concentrates on nearly-integrable nonlinear wave                   equations, that is, integrable partial differential equations and               their perturbations.  One of the goals is to use a complement of                pure mathematical theory, perturbation theory, and numerical                    experiments to describe, understand, and predict the behavior of                these systems.  A second goal is to apply these tools and                       concepts to study specific systems that arise in nonlinear                      optics.  A third goal is to use nearly integrable systems as a                  model for formulating questions of a statistical nature about the               physics of nonlinear interactions and nonlinear mode selection                  mechanisms.  The theme here is to focus on solutions, first the                 exact integrable solutions and then their behavior under                        perturbations.  The integrable theory yields explicit solutions                 and the full set of parameters for each N-mode solution,                        stability within the integrable system, and the nearby solutions                that result from unstable solutions.  Then numerical experiments                on the perturbed systems test whether nearly-integrable dynamics                can be approximated by modulated N-mode integrable solutions.  If               so, the corresponding perturbed equations are derived.  These                   tools are brought to bear on specific applied projects.                              Integrable systems of partial differential equations often                 have solutions whose properties can be exactly established.  This               is quite unlike the usual case for nonlinear partial differential               equations.  What is important here is that often the properties                 remain when the system is perturbed.  Thus one can tell a great                 deal about otherwise intractable problems.  Such problems arise                 in nonlinear optics (for example, in the design of long-distance                communication networks using fiber optics and the design of                     optical cavities for very fast switches),  in the motion of waves               in nonlinear acoustic media, and in flows around thin wings.",
