 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to enhance the undergraduate control                 engineering curriculum in the Department of Electrical and                      Systems Engineering at Oakland University via modernization and                 expansion of the current control engineering facilities.  The                   major laboratory equipment may be categorized as follows:  1) a                 pneumatic and hydraulic hardware-in-the-loop computer-based                     control experiment system, 2) a diesel engine simulator-control                 system, 3) two computer-aided control system design (CACSD)                     workstation with advanced graphics and software support, 4) two                 microcomputer-based controller hardware development stations for                8/16/32-bit microprocessors and digital signal processors, and 5)               an electronic industrial sensors module.                                                                                                                        The equipment will be used to strengthen junior and senior                      offerings by introducing new laboratory experiments and projects                in specific courses.  A well-planned sequence of laboratory                     assignment involving analysis, design, simulation and                           experimentation will expose students to strong hands-on                         experience in an Integrated Computer Control Systems Engineering                Laboratory (ICCSEL) environment.  By incorporating the proposed                 hardware-and simulator-in-the-loop systems, students will become                more familiar with applications, components, signal processing,                 computer-aided design and tools, implementation, and computer                   hardware technology for control engineering.",
