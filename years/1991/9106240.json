 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr.                        Raymond Goldstein's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award                  in support of his research at Princeton University. The thrust                  of Dr. Goldstein's research is the study of the motion of                       colloidal surfaces such as cell membranes and nucleic acids.                    The spatial patterns formed by these surfaces generally occur                   on length scales larger than molecular, and may be described by                 a continuum elastic theory.                                                                                                                                     The research involves the development of formalisms for such                    constrained variational dynamics dominated by dissipation.  A                   first step toward understanding the role of surface geometry                    and elasticity in the motion involves a local description of                    the viscous dissipation as in the dynamics of an isolated                       Brownian particle. Generalizations of a recently developed                      approach for two-dimensional systems are envisioned for the                     study of closed polymers with bending and torsional energy and                  of membranes with diffusing impurities coupled to the local                     geometry, and to develop a finite-temperature Langevin dynamics                 for closed surfaces--a statistical mechanics of shapes.",
