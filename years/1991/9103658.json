 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study is part of an on-going project to determine                  the cellular basis of cytoplasmic inheritance in alfalfa.  This                 species is one of a few in which there is a predominance of male                plastid transmission to the offspring, and for which considerable               genetic data are available.  Plastid transmission is under                      genetic control, and genotypes have been characterized as                       strong,intermediate or weak male or females, according to their                 plastid transmission frequencies.  To date the PI's laboratory                  has used quantitative, three dimensional ultrastructure, along                  with a DNA-specific fluorochrome, to analyze generative cells and               sperm cells of strong and weak male lines.  The first objective                 of the proposed research is to compare the egg cells of strong                  and weak females to determine whether egg composition before                    fertilization is a determining factor in plastid inheritance, as                preliminary data suggest.  Further studies will analyze                         fertilized eggs (zygotes) and early embryos in order to follow                  the specific fates of male and female plastids during these                     critical stages of embryogenesis.  This research will complement                other studies utilizing techniques of classical and molecular                   genetics, and promise to be invaluable for providing cytological                explanations for observed patterns of cytoplasmic organelle                     inheritance in an economically important plant.",
