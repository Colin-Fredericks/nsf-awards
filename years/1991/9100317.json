 "awd_abstract_narration": "The classification and construction of manifolds and                       varieties is one of the basic themes in mathematics.  Surgery                   theory is a fundamental tool in this area.  It is a construction                which, in certain circumstances, allows one to modify a manifold                by 'cutting and pasting', thereby changing the manifold's                       homotopy type.  The technique has many important applications.                  The study of the obstructions to doing surgery on a manifold has                become a subject in its own right, giving rise to various                       theories which model surgery in an algebraic setting.                                Poincare' spaces have the same algebraic topological                       properties as manifolds but are homotopy theoretic in nature.                   Since many of the applications of surgery theory on manifolds                   involve the use of Poincare' spaces, one would like to have a                   theory of Poincare' surgery.  This project is concerned with such               a surgery theory, building on the investigator's previous results               in the area, and with the construction of an algebraic model for                the theory.                                                                          Manifolds are very natural objects to study, being simply                  spaces which are locally like Euclidean spaces.  The space in                   which we live is either a 3-dimensional or a 4-dimensional                      manifold, depending upon whether one includes or excludes the                   time dimension.  Improving and simplifying the technical tools                  for investigating properties of manifolds is thus a fundamental                 and important endeavor.",
