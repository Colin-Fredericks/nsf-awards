 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central question in the study of plant-insect interactions is                 why herbivorous insects tend to restrict their feeding to a                     limited range of hosts.  The goal of the proposed research is to                address this question of specialization by comparing a generalist               herbivore's performance on several possible hosts in terms of                   both host quality and the rate of attack by natural enemies.                    Preliminary investigations have demonstrated that Vanessa                       cardui's growth is poor on its preferred host relative to other                 available hosts, suggesting that host quality is relatively less                important than other ecological factors in determining its host                 preferences.  The potential role of natural enemies in                          determining host preferences has been forcefully stated but                     remains relatively depauperate of experimental study.  The                      possibility of  a latitudinal gradient in importance of natural                 enemies is suggested and will be investigated by comparing                      variation in V. cardui's host preferences and the rate of attack                by natural enemies in several sites.  A generalist herbivore has                been chosen for this study to obtain an unobscured view of the                  herbivore's performance on a variety of hosts before the                        herbivore has had significant time to adapt to its host in                      multiple dimensions.",
