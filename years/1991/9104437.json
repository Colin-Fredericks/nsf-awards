 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with studies of surfaces, particularly               their structural, statistical mechanical and kinetic properties by              employing Low-Energy Electron Diffraction and Scanning Tunneling                Microscopy (STM).  Prior results on strained silicon surfaces have              shown dramatic and previously unexpected effects on the arrangement             of surface steps as a function of strain for a silicon (100)                    surface.  It is proposed to continue studies of the various                     consequences of the strain fields, including terrace width                      distributions, step-step interactions, step migration kinetics,                 step fluctuations and the temperature dependence of the step free               energies.  Quantitative studies of the double height step                       transition on silicon (100) surfaces will also be initiated.                    Exploratory studies of the initial stages of oxidation of silicon               (100) surfaces will be begun.  An investigation of the fundamentals             of the reaction will be begun using both the spatial and                        spectroscopic resolution of the STM.  This work may lead to the                 study of the interaction of vacancies with the various steps, the               nucleation and growth of voids on terraces and vacancy diffusion.               It is intended to extend the strain studies to isotropic strain                 rather than the uniaxial strain used to date.  Lastly, recent                   studies of the sodium/silicon adsorption system using an atomic                 beam source will be extended to STM observations of the 3x2 and                 other incommensutate structures and also to the potassium/silicon               system for comparison with the work of others.",
