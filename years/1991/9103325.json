 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phylogenies of organisms are inferred on the basis of characters,               the observational data gathered by systematists.  Unlike many other             systematic concepts, however, the concept of 'character\" has                    received almost no attention from systematic theorists.  With this              postdoctoral fellowship, Dr. O'Hara, a systematist, is working with             Dr. Elliott Sober, a philosopher of science, to develop a                       conceptual analysis of the character concept of systematics.                    Starting from his own definition, developed in his doctoral                     dissertation research in 1989, of a character as an observed                    difference from which we infer an evolutionary event, Dr. O'Hara                is developing arguments to show that: (1) although \"character\" is               an inherently comparative concept, the entities being compared in               character descriptions have not always been clearly specified;  (2)             the \"character problem\" in systematics (how are characters                      recognized in practice, and how should they be scored for cladistic             analysis) maps directly onto what may be called the \"event problem\"             in philosophy; and that (3) it is possible to identify the specific             points in this mapping process at which all the uncertainty in our              estimates of phylogeny is introduced.  As a result of this study,               the language of character descriptions in systematics should become             more precise, and the epistemological foundations of our knowledge              of evolutionary history should be better understood.",
