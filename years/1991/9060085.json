 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aerial wells, a device used in antiquity, are mounds of rocks                   which collect moisture from the air and release water.  They                    work best in arid regions where solar heating and radiative                     cooling are large.                                                                                                                                              The program will demonstrate that \"hydrogenesis\", an apparent                   natural phenomenon, is the principle exploited in the aerial                    well.  A working hypothesis asserts that water is collected by                  diffusion into micro pores of rocks and that there is enough                    diffusion potential for water to collect at temperatures above                  the dew point of the free air.  Analytical models of                            controlling phenomena, water collection, retention and release                  are being developed to explore the well's performance.  The                     models are based on Fick's diffusion equation, Marangoni's                      effect and Gibb's free energy equation.  A one-dimensional                      computerized model is being developed in Phase I of this SBIR                   project.  This model is to provide insight into the                             controlling phenomena as a function of independent variables                    including humidity and temperature, as well as optimum                          material properties.",
