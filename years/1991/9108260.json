 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Shapiro's group will complete the analysis of                    their 1987 experiment to measure the deflection of radio waves                  due to the gravitational effects of the Sun.  Using the                         technique of very-long-baseline interferometry, they observed                   two radio sources over a two-week interval centered on the                      annual passage of the Sun in front of one of the sources.  By                   fitting this data with a model that includes a free parameter                   scaling the effects predicted by general relativity, they will                  determine the gravitational deflection with a standard error                    of 0.1 percent of the magnitude predicted by general                            relativity.                                                                          Improving the accuracy of one of the few observational                     tests of general relativity is important not only as a test of                  the currently accepted theory of gravity, but also due to the                   role of general relativistic gravitation in the understanding                   of cosmology, black holes, quasars, and other massive                           astronomical objects.  This \"light\"-deflection experiment is                    an advance over earlier ones since it uses signals recorded in                  three widely-separated radio-frequency bands (2, 8, and 23                      GHz), allowing for higher accuracy corrections for the                          observational errors contributed by the dispersion of radio                     waves in the ionosphere and the solar corona.",
