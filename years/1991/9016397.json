 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will involve the critical evaluation of                   pollen, primarily using transmission and scanning electron                      microscopy, from those gymnosperm groups suggested as closely                   related to angiosperms and implicated as possible ancestors.                    Only a paucity of data has been reported on pollen from the                     gymnospermous plants proposed to be investigated.  A small                      database is currently in existence for dispersed gymnosperm                     pollen as well as pollen with possible angiosperm affinities.                   The proposed study, however, will principally address the nature                of in site pollen grains from the various gymnosperm groups.                    Such a narrow focus, employing electron microscopic techniques,                 allows for the accumulations of significant data regarding                      specific pollen characters and provides the opportunity to                      perform phylogenetic analyses using many more characters from the               specific taxa in question as well as to address numerous                        correlative and mechanistic queries concerning in situ pollen.                  Funds are requested to defray the costs of travel by the student                investigator to two selected domestic paleobotanical collections                of gymnosperms and one foreign collection in order to collect in                situ specimens for investigation.",
