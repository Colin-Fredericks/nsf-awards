 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State of South Dakota proposes a Statewide Systemic                         Initiative to improve mathematics and science education.  After                 thorough study of the literature and examination of exemplary                   programs in science and mathematics throughout the country, a                   state-wide group will establish standards and desired outcomes                  for mathematics and science education in South Dakota, using as                 guidelines the recommendations of NCTM, MSEB, AAAS, and others.                 School districts will be given assistance and incentives to                     analyze their curricula and devise methods for raising their                    programs to meet the new state standards.  Valid new methods of                 assessing student learning will be developed and implemented.                   Both teacher preparation and teacher enhancement will be                        strengthened to encourage teaching for understanding and                        utilizing hands-on methods.  The initiative will stress increased               citizen awareness of the importance of mathematics and science                  and promote the involvement of parents, business, and                           mathematicians and scientists with the schools.
