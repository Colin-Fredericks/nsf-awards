 "awd_abstract_narration": "In most developed societies modern policing is premised on the idea             of police presence.  For at least the last twenty years,                        commentators have stressed the importance of what is dubbed \"the                reassurance factor.\"  This emphasis assumes that people feel more               secure and safe when they believe that a police officer is nearby.              Such conventional wisdom is routinely reiterated in  scholarly                  discussions of the impact of police patrol and claims about the                 potential impact of community policing.  It also plays a central                role in the politics of police resource allocation.                                                                                                             The study being undertaken by Dr. Skogan focuses on the saliency                of the reassurance argument for understanding perceptions as well               as impacts of the police.  Based on secondary analyses of multi-                wave interviews with large panels of residents of 40 higher-crime               neighborhoods in ten cities over the course of a decade, this                   research tests several hypotheses linking police contact with                   citizen reassurance.  The project offers an operational definition              of the \"reassurance factor\" along such dimensions as fear of crime,             perceptions of crime trends, beliefs about the defensibility of                 city neighborhoods, and satisfaction with the quality of police                 service.  These dimensions will be related to citizen encounters                with a variety of kinds of policing (e.g., motorized patrol, foot               patrol, community organizing efforts).  Through an altered                      replication design (in some instances aggregating across studies                and in other instances replicating across multiple sites), the                  impact of both police visibility and actual encounters with diverse             policing efforts will be assessed.                                                                                                                              This work holds promise of a major advance.  While using extant                 data sets, the study brings them together in original ways and adds             to fundamental knowledge about the actual impact of visible                     policing and the assurance it provides.  Also, the research will                yield estimates of the impact of alternative policing strategies.               In addition to theoretical and empirical contributions, the project             is important in policy terms.  It should yield a fresh basis for                organizing routine police activities and selecting policing tactics             and strategies in light of scarce resources for years to come.",
