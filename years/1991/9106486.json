Activities include tours to leading manufacturing                  industries, representative universities and governmental research               laboratories in both the United States and Spain as well as                     workshops at both of the lead institutions.  Anticipated results                include establishment of joint research activities, development of              exchange programs for faculty and students from one institution to              the other, development of programs to improve interaction between               universities and multinational industries, and the establishment                of programs to increase the number of manufacturing engineers in                each country, especially from population segments that do not                   traditionally select technologically oriented careers.  Workshop                proceedings and video documentation will be made available to                   interested parties in both countries.",
