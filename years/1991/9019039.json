 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anabaena PCC7120 is a filamentous cyanobacterium that enters a                  developmental pathway in response to nitrogen starvation.  The                  culmination of this pathway is the differentiation of heterocysts,              cells specialized for nitrogen fixation.  The development of                    heterocysts includes the appearance of gene products involved in                nitrogen fixation, the disappearance of certain gene products                   involved in photosynthesis and the constitutive expression other                gene products such as those involved in energy metabolism.  We have             isolated expression other gene products such as those involved in               energy metabolism.  We have isolated and determined the sequence                of sixteen photosynthesis genes that comprise eight transcription               units within the Anabaena genome, and one gene involved in carbon               metabolism.  These genes fall into two classes: 1) those that are               constituitively expressed and 2) those that are expressed only in               vegetative cells.  Based on comparative sequence analysis around                the transcription initiation sites utilized during vegetative                   growth, we predict that one transcription signal lies at -10                    nucleotides from the transcription initiation site.  We have                    developed a system for the functional analysis of Anabaena                      promoters in vivo.  We will use this system and the characterized               genes to define the promoters utilized for transcription in                     undifferentiated vegetative cells and to examine whether promoter               utilization plays a role in differential gene expression during                 heterocyst development.",
