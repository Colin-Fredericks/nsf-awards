Vladimir Kinilev and Marat Guriev, will participate in                          discussions with U.S. university and state education                            officials in a series of meetings and site visits                               organized by Georgetown University with primary support                         from the Ford Foundation.  The main purpose of including                        these two officials is to initiate discussions on                               potential cooperation on the issue of the equivalency of                        degrees and academic training programs between the                              Soviet Union and the United States.  This is becoming an                        increasingly important issue to both countries as                               growing numbers of scientists and engineers trained in                          the Soviet Union come to the U.S. for temporary or                              permanent work.",
