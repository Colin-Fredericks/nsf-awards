 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will study a                    number of problems in complex analysis and potential theory.  In                particular, he will investigate the global behavior of solutions                of holomorphic Cauchy problems, the spectra of various potential                theoretic integral operators, the cyclicity of the shift operator               on Bergman spaces, and the reflection of harmonic functions in                  higher dimensions.  The techniques used to attack such a                        diversity of problems are drawn from the theory of partial                      differential equations, complex analysis and potential theory.                       Historically the areas of mathematics known as the  theory                 of partial differential equations and the theory of complex                     variables have been closely associated with each other.  Indeed                 much of nineteenth century mathematics revolved around this                     relationship between partial differential equations and complex                 variables, with each area having a profound influence on the                    other.  In this project the principal investigator will use this                symbiotic relationship between the two areas to study a number of               interesting problems involving harmonic functions in several                    space dimensions. ***//",
