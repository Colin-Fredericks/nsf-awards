 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute seeks to improve mathematics, science and engineering             programs at community colleges nationwide by more fully involving               key community college disciplinary leaders in national educational              and scientific activities. It is  creating a broader awareness                  among faculty at community colleges of the scope and mission                    of the National Science Foundation, the two-year college divisions              of their respective academic disciplinary societies, and the                    American Association of Community and Junior Colleges. The                      participating interns are learning of technological advances and of             grant policies and procedures and are disseminating this knowledge              to others in their community. The experiences of the interns                    include: extensive participation \"on site\" at NSF in agency                     activities related to strengthening education; participation in                 seminars/workshops; interviews, discussions and other activities                with the AACJC and the respective academic discipline associations.             Each intern is participating fully in internal NSF activities                   and is assigned to one of the EHR divisions.",
