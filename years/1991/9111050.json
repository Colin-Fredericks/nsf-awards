 "awd_abstract_narration": "Voluntary compliance by citizens with the laws and policies of the              nation is fundamental to the stable functioning of democratic                   society.  Although compliance can be produced in the short run by               force, theory maintains that in the long run compliance must be                 voluntary if democratic institutions are to survive.                                                                                                            This study examines the nature, extent, and determinants of                     voluntary or contingent compliance by comparing decisions to                    volunteer for military service with decisions to resistance                     military conscription.  Two critical cases will be examined, the                Irish in Britain during the late 19th and early 20th century and                the French Canadians during this century.  These cases will be used             to test the hypothesis that voluntary compliance is possible only               when institutional arrangements exists that provide information to              the public so that government policies are perceived as fair and                other citizens are perceived as doing their fair share.                                                                                                         When completed this study will enhance our understanding of the                 circumstances under which citizens will voluntarily comply with                 government laws and policies.  The findings should have                         implications not only for contemporary democracies such as the                  United States but for the many nations in Eastern Europe and the                third world that are struggling to establish stable democratic                  rule.",
