 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award in linguistics will support collaborative                   research between Dr. Kenneth N. Stevens of the Massachusetts                    Institute of Technology (M.I.T) and Dr. Gunnar Fant of the                      Royal Institute of Technology (R.I.T) in Stockholm, Sweden.                     The objective of the proposed project is to advance scientific                  understanding of the acoustic processes of speech sounds,                       specifically consonant production.                                                                                                                              The M.I.T and R.I.T speech groups have had a long-standing                      collaboration in theoretical studies of acoustics and                           perception of consonants.  Recently, the R.I.T group has                        been active in the development of computer-based vocal                          tract-models of consonant production; whereas, the MIT group                    has focused on acoustic analysis and synthesis of consonants                    and the application of acoustic studies to theories of                          phonetics and phonology.  The proposed collaboration will                       link the recent work of American and Swedish speech groups                      in problematic areas in consonant production.  These                            include:  (1) sound generation at the larynx at vowel-                          consonant and consonant-vowel boundaries, (2) mechanisms of                     sound production at the release of stop consonants; and (3)                     acoustic changes at the implosion and release of nasal                          consonants.  Dr. Stevens proposes to use the computer-based                     model at R.I.T to extensively test the M.I.T theories and to                    understand the model so it can be implemented on computers                      at M.I.T. for future research work.  The field will benefit                     from the complementary expertise of both groups and advance                     our understanding of consonant production and processes.  This                  research has important applications in the development of                       machine-made (electronic) speech synthesis and recognition.                     It also has relevance for the diagnosis and treatment of                        communication disorders and in second language learning.",
