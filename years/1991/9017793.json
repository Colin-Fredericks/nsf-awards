 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of neuropeptides has exploded with activity in the past               few years because of advances in isolation techniques and                       instrumentatation for structural characterization.  Although many               insect neuropeptides have recently been characterized there is a                real paucity of information on their receptors and mode of action.              In researching a brain neuropeptide that regulates pheromone                    production in redbanded leafroller moths, Dr. Roelofs discovered                that the corpus bursae was essential for activity of this                       neuropeptide.  He now has isolated a factor from the bursa that is              released when the brain neuropeptide is present and this factor,                in turn, is involved in turning on pheromone production.  A unique              opportunity is presented to define the role of these peptides in                pheromone production.  This not only provides a basis for                       comparison of hormonal controls in other insect species, with                   implications on how this endocrine system evolved, but also will                allow the identification of specific genes encoding these hormones              for possible use in transgenic manipulations for novel insect                   control programs.//",
