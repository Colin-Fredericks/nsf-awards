 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program concentrates on designing efficient graph                 algorithms using topological methods.  The approaches are based on              recently developed techniques and results in topological graph theory.               A topological approach is proposed to obtain a polynomial-time             bounded probabilistic algorithm solving the graph isomorphism problem,          which is one of the most important graph problems whose complexity              still remains unknown and which has many applications.  The method              adopted here is to derive a complete invariant of a graph that can be           computed efficiently, based on the combination of the topological and           combinatorial structures of the graph.                                               The project is also seeking an extension of the theory and                 applications of Whitney's linear synthesis theorem for 2-connected              graphs.  A concept of semi-k-connectedness of graphs is introduced,             and a conjecture is proposed that every k-connected graph has a semi-           k-connected linear synthesis.  Such an extension will provide us with           techniques that will find wide applications in designing efficient              sequential and parallel algorithms for such problems as graph                   connectivity, graph imbedding, and graph emulation.",
