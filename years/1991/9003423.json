 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boolean categories provide a framework for programming language                 semantics.  In contrast to the syntax-driven style commonly employed            in theoretical computer science, there is but one primitive, program-           chaining, in terms of which all other constructs must be expressed;             extensive work by category theorists in the past four decades has               demonstrated the feasibility of this approach.  The abstract theory of          Boolean categories and some of its specializations have been developed          by the proposer and his close colleagues in the past ten years.  This           work has studied fundamental control structures including recursion.            Further, all Boolean categories have an intrinsic theory of predicate           transformation which provides a high-level specification language of            logical assertions.  It is a theorem that this specification language           follows the lines of classical nondeterminism.  By contrast, the                choice of model is flexible enough to allow the hidden state to be              arbitrarily complex, it being possible to represent very general forms          of nondeterminism.  The research centers on incorporating fairness and          unbounded nondeterminism into the Boolean category framework.",
