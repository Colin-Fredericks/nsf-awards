The investigator plans to                          conduct both batch and continuous culture experiments                           using tolualdehyde (degraded by plasmid-encoded enzymes),                       benzoate (degraded by plasmid- or chromosomally-encoded                         enzymes), and  lysine (degraded by chromosomally-encoded                        enzymes), singly and in pairs to determine how the nature                       of the substrate and the specific growth rate of the                            culture influence the rate constants that describe plasmid                      loss.                                                                                                                                                           Knowledge of factors that control the rate at which                             plasmids are lost will permit the engineering design of                         treatment systems to minimize their loss and otherwise                          compensate for it. This knowledge will also beneficially                        affect the operating efficiency of existing wastewater                          treatment plants that depend on biological processes for                        their operation.",
