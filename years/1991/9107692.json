 "awd_abstract_narration": "Various environmental conditions including both abiotic (wind,                  temperature, water, soil, light, etc.) and biotic (micro-organisms,             viruses, insects, plants and animals) exert their influences on                 plants.  Here, four environmental factors have been selected for                dicussion.  They include abiotic (water and temperature) and biotic             (insects and plant diseases).  Despite the evolution of natural                 defense mechanisms, many especially food and fiber crops, still                 experience serious losses every year due to environmental stress.               Recently, scientists have learned to manipulate plants to overcome              some of these conditions through newly discovered techniques such               as molecular genetics and biotechnology.  An important goal of this             workshop is to bring together specialists in these fields to share              their expertise with the plants scientists at the major                         Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's).",
