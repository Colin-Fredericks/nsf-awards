 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides for a series of workshops for high                        school teachers during the XII Biennial Conference on                           Chemical Education of the Division of Chemical Education of                     the American Chemical Society.  The conference will be held                     in the summer of 1992, in Davis, California.  In addition to                    supporting teachers at the workshops and the Biennial                           Conference a visiting mentor Teacher Program and a follow-up                    program for the participants will be provided.  The workshops                   will cover the topics:  (a) the use of computers in the                         classroom, (b) employing demonstrations, (c) using consumer                     chemicals and supplies and (d) techniques of microchemistry.                    In the follow-up sessions prior participants will be asked to                   bring at least one of their colleagues so that more teachers                    will be involved.  Altogether 150 teachers will be supported                    by the project.  The NSF funds are being matched by funds                       from the American Chemical Society, the Council of Chemical                     Research and private industry.  The matching funds amount to                    about 36% of the NSF grant.",
