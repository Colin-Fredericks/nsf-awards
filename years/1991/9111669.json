 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel services work order (CTS-91-AUS-05) supports the                    transportation of eleven U.S. scientists to participate in the                  Joint Symposium on Electron and Ion Swarms and Low-Energy Electron              Scattering, to be held in Gold Coast, Australia, July 18-20, 1991.              The meeting takes place under the auspices of the U.S.-Australia                Cooperative Science Program, and brings together two related                    symposia, one focusing on basic collisional processes and the                   other emphasizing applications of such processes to other fields                of science, such as aeronomy, and to working technological                      devices.  The U.S. co-organizers are Professor Vincent McKoy and                Dr. Sandor Trajmar, of the California Institute of Technology.                  The Australian co-organizer is Dr. S. J. Buckman, Australian                    National University, Canberra.  Australian participation is being               supported by the Australian Department of Industry, Technology,                 and Commerce.  There will be additional participation from third                countries.                                                                                                                                                      The interdisciplinary research to be discussed at the symposium is              relevant to several areas of plasma physics.  One aim of the                    meeting is to achieve a better understanding of the fundamental                 processes occurring in such applications of plasmas as electrical               discharge devices (e.g. lamps and lasers), plasma processing of                 materials, flue gas clean-up, and magnetohydrodynamic power                     generation, among others.  To date, many successful applications                of plasmas have been developed empirically, because of the lack of              such a basic understanding of the processes involved.  Further                  advances in the technology may be expected from enhancing the                   interaction between pure and applied science in this field, an                  important goal of the symposium.",
