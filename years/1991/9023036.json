 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intuition and experience indicate that individuals use language to              solve strategic problems, but the Nash equilibrium, the principal               solution concept used in non-cooperative game theory, does not                  provide a sensible framework in which meaningful communication can              arise.  The principal goal of this project is to rigorously define              where players will use communication to arrive at more efficient                outcomes and where communication will fail to improve the outcome.              The project investigates the idea that if communication is                      possible, then methods of communication evolve and prevent players              from playing inefficient equilibria.  The study uses the concept                of evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS).  It goes beyond earlier              work because it does not assume that language has a focal meaning               but allows the meaning of words to arise as part of an                          evolutionarily stable equilibrium.  Evolutionarily stable                       strategies fail to exist in many games.  The project explores                   alternative definitions of evolutionarily stable equilibria that                plausibly capture the dynamics of evolving non-cooperative systems              with communication.  The outcomes of communication in games in                  which agents have private information are studied.  A new general               model of signalling games is developed.                                                                                                                         This project develops a general framework for rigorously analyzing              the way communication influences bargaining among rational economic             agents with incomplete information.  The results should provide new             insights into a wide range of important economic problems.  This                work extends previous research by the investigator on oligopoly                 theory, tax policy, organizational design and litigation.  The                  development of alternative general concepts of evolutionarily                   stable equilibrium could prove useful eventually to mathematical                biology.  The research on the evolution of language could make a                contribution to linguistics.",
