 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer-based materials will be created to enable high school students         to develop specific concepts in advanced mathematics and trigonometry           through guided exploration of sound and hearing.  The novelty of this           approach lies in its integration of science and mathematics to promote          active, situated learning and in its use of computer-generated                  manipulatives to foster the development of physical intuition as a              precursor to mathematical abstraction.  Computer generated sound waves          are audible and displayed graphically and as an equation.  Changing the         either the sound or the graph or the equation will produce appropriate          changes in the other representations.  Operations are performed on the          waves in various \"rooms\", so that waves van be manipulated, added,              multiplied, etc.  Mathematics of trigonometry, vector addition,                 logarithmic behavior and Fourier series can be studied.  The materials          will be field tested in area high schools and used in preservice and            inservice teacher education projects under a subcontract with UC Irvine.",
