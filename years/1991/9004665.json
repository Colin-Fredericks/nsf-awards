 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) will be used as a model to study symptom             manifestation, defective interfering (DI) RNA formation and RNA                 recombination.  The TCV system is uniquely suited for these                     studies; it is the only plant or animal virus associated with                   avirulent and virulent sat-RNAs which can recombine their genomes               and DI RNAs which can be generated de novo from in vitro                        synthesized TCV transcripts.  Furthermore, two isolates of TCV have             distinct biological properties: subviral RNAs only produce symptoms             when associated with the TCV-M isolate and DI RNAs have only been               generated from the TCV-B isolate.  Chimeric TCV genomic RNAs will               be constructed to ascertain which region of TCV RNA is involved in              differential symptom production and DI formation.  The mechanism                by which DI RNAs and sat-RNA recombinants are formed will also be               investigated.  The putative internal replicase recognition sequence             in sat-RNA C, found at the right hand junction of all recombinant               sat-RNAs, will be deleted, altered and/or moved from its current                location to determine the importance of the sequence in                         recombination.  A copy choice model versus a breakage and ligation              model for the formation of descendance RNAs will also be tested.                Sat-RNA transcripts with defined mutations, allowing differential               replication of plus or minus strands, will be added to both                     protoplasts and plant extracts.  RNA recombination will be detected             by polymerase chain reaction techniques.***//",
