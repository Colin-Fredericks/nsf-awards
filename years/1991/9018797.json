 "awd_abstract_narration": "We developed a unique system with which to examine the biogenesis               of chloroplast thylakoid membranes.  A major complex of the                     thylakoid membrane is the light-harvesting chlorophyll (chl) a/b-               proteins complex (LCH-2).  Formation of this complex during                     development of the chloroplast in the alga Chlamydomonas                        reinhardtii y-1 can be measured after exposure to light.  Electron              microscopy of such cells has revealed that the site of initial                  assembly of the membranes is at the level of the chloroplast                    envelope.  The project will focus on the Chl-binding apoprotein of              LCH-2 (LCHP), which will be studied to determine the site and                   mechanism of integration of the protein into the membrane and                   interaction of the protein with Chl.  Oligonucleotide-directed                  mutations will be generated in the cabII-1 gene encoding this                   protein.  After transformation, cells will be isolated that express             the mutant gene.  The fate of the wild-type and mutant LCHPs will               be examined kinetically in an in vivo context.  These results will              markedly enhance understanding of membrane assembly.                                                                                                            Biological membranes are essential to life.  They form a barrier                between the cell and the environment and also divide the cell into              various compartments with specialized functions.  The maintenance               of differ environments on different sides of a membrane are                     essential for respiratory energy production in organelles known as              mitochondria and for chemical energy production from light during               the process of photosynthesis in organelles known as chloroplasts.              The ability of these specialized membranes to carry out these                   essential functions is based on the complex structure of the                    membranes which includes complexes of lipids, proteins, pigments                and low-molecular weight electron carriers.  This proposal will                 address the fundamental question of how such complex membranes are              assembled.//",
