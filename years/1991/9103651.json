 "awd_abstract_narration": "Political talk, whether in elections campaigns, legislative                     debates, public meetings, or elsewhere, is vital to the political               process. Yet very little is understood about the circumstances                  under which talk affects political outcomes.  This research will                develop game theoretic models which explore the role of debate and              explanation in political decision making.  Specifically, the                    project will examine talk in two circumstances: within legislatures             and committees as members debate policy choices, and during                     elections as legislators attempt to explain and defend their                    actions to constituents.                                                                                                                                        The principal analytic tool used will be the theory of games with               incomplete information -- specifically games involving costless                 signals or communication. This is because political talk is                     frequently cheap. It is easy for individuals to make claims that                are not true and are know to be untrue.  This feature generates a               fundamental credibility problem that lies at the heart of cheap                 talk models.                                                                                                                                                    When completed this project will help us better understand the                  impact of political communication on political outcomes.",
