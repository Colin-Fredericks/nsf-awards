 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the seventh in a series of                 conferences on mathematical foundations of programming semantics.               This research area encompasses research on all aspects of the design            and implementation of programming languages, including the semantics            of such languages.  Topics of interest include type theory, domain              theory, and applications of category theory to semantics.  Previous             conferences have been distinguished by the breadth of interests of the          participants and by the high-level of interaction which has taken               place between researchers representing the diverse areas mentioned.             The conference includes three types of formal activities:                                                                                                                      1.  invited talks by five leading researchers                                   2.  shorter presentations of refereed,                                              contributed papers                                                          3.  special sessions devoted to particular research                                 directions                                                                                                                                          The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer          Verlag as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, as was the             case with the 1st, 3rd and 5th conferences.",
