 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a collaborative project between the Organization for Tropical                Studies (a consortium of 45 U.S. Costa Rican universities and                   museums) and the National Biodiversity Institute (INBio, a Costa                Rican nongovernmental organization), a biodiversity inventory of                tropical rainforest insects, spiders, and mites will initiated for              La Selva, a biotically rich and scientifically active biological                station situated in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica.  This                  stage of the project aims to produce full, species-level                        inventories for several focal groups of insects, spiders, and                   mites, including some of the most important groups in rainforest                habitats.  These inventories will be based on ecologically                      structured, repeatable sampling methods, as well as on less-                    structure supplemental collecting.  A must broader range of survey              groups, each including a focal group, will be inventoried using the             structured sampling techniques alone.  Statistical methods will be              explored for estimating the total number of insect, spider, and                 mite species in the study areas, using the full inventory data for              the groups to evaluate these methods and to calibrate estimates of              species number for the broader survey groups.  The sampling design              will permit evaluation of the contributions of habitat would type               vegetation structure species, and season to overall species                     richness.  These estimated promise to provide the most realistic                and comprehensive data yet available on the diversity of insect and             spider species of tropical rainforests, and diversity estimates for             any rainforest mite fauna.  These groups or organisms, while                    representing well overall the species on earth, are still among the             most poorly known.  Specimens will be integrated into the national              biodiversity inventory already underway at INBio, thus placing the              La Selva survey material in a larger geographical and biological                context, promoting further study of this material by INBio's                    growing international network of specialists, and ensuring                      permanent accessibility of the specimens.  The project is                       structured  to promote extensive new avenues of collaboration                   between North American and Costa Rican scientists.",
