 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will continue her               important work on the well-posedness of systems of partial                      differential equations that can change type.  Such systems have                 solutions of shock-wave type that serve as mechanisms for the                   propoagation of waves, even in parts of the domain where the                    system is no longer hyperbolic.  These types of problems occur in               the transonic flow of gases and in the flow of multi-phase fluids               through porous media.  In particular, the principal investigator                will study the stability of shock waves in systems of equations                 that undergo changes from hyperbolic to elliptic type using                     regularization and perturbation methods.                                             The behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) under unusual                   conditions such as in the upper atmosphere or in the earth is                   governed by a complicated system of partial differential                        equations that can under go what is called a \"change of type\".                  Basically this means that the system has solutions of different                 kinds in different parts of the domain.  As an illustration,                    think of the behavior of a seismic wave generated inside the                    earth by a earthquake.  The wave passes through regions that are                in liquid, solid or composite states.  In this project the                      principal investigator will examine certain solutions of a system               of model equations that exhibit change-of-type behavior that are                known as \"shock waves\".  The study of shock waves arises in such                technologically important areas as transonic flow and flow                      through porous media.",
