 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides an experimental network to serve as a test-                 bed for student projects, including both class projects and                     undergraduate research projects.  These projects include the                    design and testing of protocols, the development of network                     applications, the management of networks, and the development                   of distributed systems.  Students, through the use of this                      network, gain hands on experience in network system programming                 and the development of applications for local area networks.                    The School of Sciences at SIUE supports two summer research                     projects:  the junior year summer year research program and the                 minority summer research program.  Many of the projects have                    been designed with these programs in mind.  The network                         consists of six UNIX based workstations that are connected by                   a complete point-to-point topology as well as through an                        Ethernet bus.  This innovative connection scheme allows for a                   wide variety of projects and laboratory exercises, including                    the study of multipoint routing.  In addition, the network is                   connected to the department's existing Ethernet through a                       gateway allowing students to develop projects without                           interfering with the operation of the existing network by                       disconnecting the gateway from the department's network.                        Later, after a student's project has been thoroughly tested, it                 can be run on a larger network by reconnecting the gateway.",
