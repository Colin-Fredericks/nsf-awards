 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is aimed at developing process control                                                                                                    algorithms to handle both constraints and uncertainty.                          Constraints affect controller design because while the dynamic                                                                                                  behavior of many processes can be accurately described by a                     linear model, system operation is always subject to                             constraints which are nonlinear elements.  The controller has                                                                                                   to be designed to handle these nonlinearities.  Such                            constraints may arise from actuator saturation or processing                                                                                                    limitations (certain temperatures and pressures may not be                      exceeded, for example).  Uncertainty is a factor because the                                                                                                    control designer never has a perfect dynamic description                        (model) of any real industrial process.  The system is                          approximated and model order and parameters always contain                      some error, and may even change with operating conditions.                                                                                                      The PI plans to implement two techniques for dealing with such                                                                                                  problems, Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Anti-Windup                        Bumpless-Transfer (AWBT).  MPC requires that the control                        objective is expressed in terms of a single quadratic                           objective function and the constraints are translated into                      linear inequality constraints.  AWBT controller design                          proceeds in two steps where first an acceptable linear robust                                                                                                   controller is designed neglecting all nonlinear loop elements                                                                                                   and objectives.  Then a compensation scheme is added which                      deals with the nonlinear issues such as constraints.  This                      research will proceed in three steps:                                                                                                                           (1) A new robust linear MPC controller will be designed.  It                                                                                                    will be implemented in a nonlinear manner through an optimizer                                                                                                  which aims at satisfying all process constraints while                          minimizing the deviation from linear behavior.                                                                                                                  (2) Development of an AWBT synthesis procedure that balances                    the                                                                             trade-offs between smooth switching performance, measurement                    noise                                                                           sensitivity and robustness.                                                                                                                                     (3) Development of mechanisms to translate practical                            objectives and constraints into an MPC or AWBT formalism in an                                                                                                                                                                                  effective manner.",
