 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Deborah Pearsall                 and James Zeidler will continue their collaborative                             archaeological research in the Jama drainage in northern Ecuador.               Their work has focussed on the site of San Isidro, a large                      centrally located earthern mound which probably functioned as a                 regional ceremonial and administrative center.  The site's size                 and monumental architecture imply the existence of surplus                      production capable of supporting a dense population.  Materials                 recovered to date suggest that San Isidro was a major point of                  external contact and commodity flow both along the coast of                     Ecuador and between the coast and the highlands.  In the course                 of their work, Drs. Zeidler and Pearsall have surveyed the                      surrounding region to locate smaller sites and related                          agricultural features.  The goal of this aspect of the research                 is to set San Isidro into a broader regional context.  The                      current NSF award will permit the team to conduct a pedestrian                  survey of a last survey area and to finish analyses of survey                   data and associated artifacts.  These final steps will permit the               analysis of both regional settlement patterns, allowing                         investigation of temporal shifts in site location, size and                     function, and of patterns of setttlement growth and social                      transformation over time.                                                                                                                                       The research is important because it will give new insight into                 the process of demographic growth as well as change in                          subsistence and the accompanying development of cultural                        complexity which took place in this tropical area of northern                   Ecuador.  Although such complex societies arose in the tropics                  many times in different parts of the world, the underlying                      processes are not well understood.  Ecuador is known to be rich                 in prehistoric remains, but little archaeological research has                  been conducted there. This project will help to remedy that                     situation.",
