 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this research is an evaluation of the                        stability-dependent terms of the equation for the budget of                     turbulent kinetic energy in the lower atmosphere.  Theory gives                 the form of this important relation, but the contributions made                 by various mechanisms involved must be evaluated by experiment.                 Previous evaluations, many obtained more than 20 years ago, are                 now considered uncertain.  This project will use improved                       equipment and will work jointly with scientists from the CSIRO                  Centre for Environmental Mechanics, Canberra, Australia, to carry               out a complete study of the turbulence budget in the first 16 m                 over an extensive, treeless plain in New South Wales.                           Observations will be made over a wide range of atmospheric                      stability and will include simultaneous measurements of mean wind               profiles, turbulence spectra, net radiation, vertical gradients                 of air temperature and dew point, rates of thermal exchange                     across the soil-air interface, and the vertical turbulent fluxes                of turbulent energy, momentum, and heat.",
