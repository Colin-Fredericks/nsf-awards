 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to tolerate saline conditions is a variable and complex             trait in plants.  Salinity tolerance includes the ability to                    respond to osmotic stress and resistance to toxicity of individual              ions.  These traits are significant in determining the natural                  distribution of plants, and are important in agriculture, because               salinity may limit productivity, especially in irrigated soils.                 The study will be done on Charophytes, complex macrophytic algae                closely related to the line which gave rise to higher plants.                   These algae have large internodal cells, permitting experimental                manipulations not possible in other plants.  Two closely related                species, Chara corallina, an obligate freshwater species, and C.                buckellii, a species collected from a salt lake which can be                    cultured in fresh or salt water will be studied.  The two species               differ in their ability to regulate turgor and in their tolerance               to sodium and magnesium.  Dr. Bisson will study ion fluxes and the              mechanism by which they occur in intact cells, cells with                       permeabilized plasmalemma, cells whose internal contents have been              perfused away and replaced by controlled solutions, isolated                    vesicles of membrane, and patches of membrane.  The aim is to                   elucidate the mechanism of movement and how this movement is                    controlled by environmental and cytoplasmic factors to confer                   resistance to salt toxicity.//",
