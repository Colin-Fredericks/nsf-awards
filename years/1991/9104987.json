 "awd_abstract_narration": "Haskell is a general purpose, purely functional programming language,           designed by a 15-member international committee, and named after the            logician Haskell B. Curry.  The committee was formed because it was             felt that research and application of modern functional languages were          being hampered by the lack of a common language.  The design was                completed in April 1990, and has been very well received both inside            and outside the functional programming community.                                    Naturally, there is a great need for a good, robust, and freely            available implementation of Haskell.  The Yale Haskell implementation           has the potential to serve this role, it being based on years of                functional language implementation experience at Yale, and being the            most comprehensive implementation of Haskell currently available                supporting both compiled and interpreted code, separate compilation,            and program development tools.                                                       However, Yale Haskell needs further support to be truly effective          and this award provides that support.  Maintaining such a system is             not an easy task, and falls more in the category of software                    maintenance than research.  Because of the rapid growth of functional           programming, the demand for an effective and reliable implementation            of Haskell, and the lack of other implementations as comprehensive,             necessitates support for Yale Haskell.  The goals are to stabilize,             maintain, distribute, and improve the implementation.",
