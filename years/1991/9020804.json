 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Jensen will                 study metal ion catalyzed reactions of organic substances with                  water as a means to determine the reactive behavior of metal                    ions in various states of complexation. Metal ions play a vital                 role in the chemical processes essential to our quality of                      life, both from an industrial/economic viewpoint as well as                     from a biological perspective. Information gained via                           exploration of the dependence of metal ion reactivity on the                    state of metal complexation is expected to have application to                  environmental problems (e.g., problems related to                               detoxification of organomercurials in the environment) and to                   the development of new chemical transformations.                                                                                                                It has been shown that the ability of mercury(II) ions to                       promote hydrolysis of O,S-acetals is greatly diminished when                    the reaction is performed in the presence of anions that are                    capable of complexing this ion. The project seeks to clarify                    the role of the heavy metal ion in such reactions, i.e., does                   the metal simply function as a Lewis acid, or does the reaction                 with, e.g., O,S-acetals involve oxidation of sulfur via                         electron transfer to the heavy metal ion? The effect of                         changing the hydrolysis-promoting reagent from a Lewis acid                     reagent to an electron transfer reagent will be probed via                      kinetic studies that involve high oxidation state                               metallocomplexes of a variety of transition metals. Fast                        reaction kinetic (i.e., stopped-flow) techniques will be                        utilized to detect build-up of oxidized sulfur species that is                  postulated to occur prior to decomposition of the O,S-acetal in                 electron transfer mediated processes.",
