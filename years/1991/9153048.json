 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Instrumentation Technology program at the Texas State                       Technical Institute/Waco is developing a laboratory to prepare                  specialized electronic-electromechanical technicians for the                    continuous and batch manufacturing industries.  The intent of                   this laboratory development is to leapfrog the gap between                      current state-of-the-art training facilities and industrial                     needs through the integration of an entire control system.                      Through the use of process control and automated manufacturing                  as a unified system, expanded educational opportunities are                     provided by system-level integration of control components.  A                  high-level communication network using MAP is used to                           interconnect the various components from a centralized control                  station via a token ring platform.  The network and associated                  process control components are used to educate technical                        students to specify, purchase, install, operate and maintain                    this and other high level communication networks.",
