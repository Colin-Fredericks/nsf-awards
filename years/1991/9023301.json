 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar energy can be suited to tasks such as producing pure metals               from their ores by using concentrated sunlight to heat reactants                to high enough temperatures to initiate reactions.  The PI plans                to investigate the use of solar energy as process heat to produce               zinc and carbon monoxide from zinc oxide using titanium trioxide.                                                                                               A two step high temperature process is planned: reduction of zinc               oxide (ZnO) with titanium sesquioxide (Ti2O3) to produce zinc and               titanium dioxide (TiO2) followed by reduction of TiO2 back to Ti2O3             by reaction with carbon.  He plans to determine the overall                     reaction rate for the conversion of zinc oxide to metallic zinc                 using an electric furnace as the reactor.  For the cases where                  zinc evolves in the gas phase, the reactants experience a weight                loss which will be followed with a microbalance and recorded with               a data acquisition system.  This data will be used to establish                 the rate.  When zinc forms as a liquid, the products will be                    quenched after specified run times.  A plot of zinc yield versus                time will be used to determine the rate.***",
