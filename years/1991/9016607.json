 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the participation of ten US                     scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on \"Basic Mechanisms                     of Helium Heat Transfer and Related Influence on Stability of                   Superconducting Magnets.\"  The interactions between helium                      heat transfer and superconducting magnets are of great                          importance and interest right now.  In spite of the progress                    that is being made with high temperature superconductors,                       liquid or supercritical helium cooled superconductors will                      still be used in large-scale projects such as the Super-                        conducting Super Collider (SSC) for some time to come. By                       bringing together scientists from different magnet stabilty                     and heat transfer projects in the US and Japan, this seminar                    should enable  participants to make considerable contributions                  to both subjects.                                                                                                                                               The seminar will be held August 26-30, 1991 in Los Angeles,                     CA.  The co-organizers are Professor T H K  Frederking,                         Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California,                   Los Angeles and Professor Takehiro Ito, Kyushu University,                      Japan.  Specific topics to be discussed at the seminar                          include (1) basic mechanisms of helium heat transfer;  (2)                      stability criteria of superconductors and procedures to                         analyze conductor-coolant coupled transient phenomena; and                      (3) priorities in various areas of cooling technology.  This                    is the second seminar on this subject, the first being held                     in 1988.  There have been considerable developments in this                     area since the first joint seminar held in Fukuoka, Japan in                    1988 and this seminar should build upon  and extend the                         scientific cooperation established at that time.",
