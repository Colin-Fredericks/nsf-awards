 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has indicated that it is surprisingly difficult to              achieve conceptual understanding in many fundamental topics in science.         The primary focus of this project will be learning studies aimed at             fostering conceptual understanding, where individuals or pairs of               students are taken through a lesson sequence and encouraged to think            aloud during the sequence.  A specific goal of the project is to develop        exemplary lessons that can foster conceptual change in difficult areas.         A more general goal is to identify critical learning processes and              teaching strategies in successful science lessons that can guide                curriculum developers and teacher trainers in other science areas.  On          the basis of preliminary studies, we propose to develop a set of                learning study methodologies that use a combination of descriptive and          experimental methods.  In addition to whether students are learning from        the lessons, the studies will focus on identifying which teaching               strategies are critical and why students are learning from them.                                                                                                Major outcomes of the project will include:  (1) a set of exemplary             science lessons for promoting conceptual change; (2) new methodologies          for conducting learning studies in educational research; (3)                    descriptions of critical learning processes; and (4) descriptions of            general teaching strategies for use in science lessons in other areas.",
