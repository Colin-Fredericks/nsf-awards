 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. J. Bruce Overmier of the University                     of Minnesota for a long term visit to work with Drs. Robert                     Murison and Holger Ursin of the Institute of Physiological                      Psychology of the University of Bergen, Norway.  These                          individuals share an interest in the effects of stress on                       the behavioral, physiological and immunological functioning                     of an animal.  Dr. Overmier's primary area of research has                      been in behavioral experimental psychology and defensive                        conditioning, while Dr. Murison's has been in physiological                     psychology and Dr. Ursin's in medicine and stress.  The                         research they propose to carry out collaboratively requires                     that each become familiar with the other's areas and that                       they adopt an integrative approach to the psychobiology of                      stress.                                                                                                                                                         It has been well demonstrated that stress has a wide variety                    of effects upon the funcioning of an animal.  In addition,                      exposure to a prior stressor can have either an ameliorative                    or a sensitizing influence upon the response to a second                        stressor.  It is important to determine the explicit conditions                 under which such prior exposures have these two different                       influences and whether these conditions are the same or                         different for the behavioral, physiological, and immunological                  systems.  These three lines of research are pursued in this                     collaboration.",
