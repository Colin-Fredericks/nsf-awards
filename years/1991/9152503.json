Badler.  Based on the Director's existing                   nationally and internationally recognized Computer Graphics                     effort, the USEVL brings modern high-performance workstations                   for visualization into the Undergraduate curriculum and                         experience.  Visualization provides the most direct and                         exciting pathway into modern high-performance computing.  Not                   only does the Computer Science student learn the principles and                 use of high-speed workstations, but the experience carries over                 into many other aspects of scientific and technological                         education.  Conversely, non-Computer Science majors (that is,                   other Engineering and Science majors), discover that the power                  of visualization can be applied to the fundamental concepts and                 applications of their own disciplines.  The development expands                 the existing educational graphics nucleus of four Silicon                       Graphics Iris 4D workstations by adding five workstations plus                  a fast fileserver.  Existing in-house and no-cost commercial                    software will be used to provide instant usability for the                      USEVL facility.",
