 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project enables a major upgrade to the laboratory component                 of the course Techniques of Radio Astronomy taken by junior and                 senior undergraduates in the Five College Astronomy Department.                 This effort is centered around the 21-cm horn antenna                           constructed for this laboratory some years ago; the present                     project allows the addition of a high resolution                                autocorrelation spectrometer for use in spectroscopic                           observations of hydrogen in the Milky Way.  This instrument has                 replaced a low resolution filter spectrometer that had been on                  loan to this laboratory, but which was far from ideal and is no                 longer available.  The autocorrelator is based on a 80386-                      personal computer, which takes the data and performs Fourier                    Transforms to obtain the spectral power distribution, as well                   as basic tasks such as calculating the direction in which the                   (manually operated) telescope is to be pointed.  The computer                   also runs the spectral line reduction software package                          developed at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory.                      After the period during which data are taken, the computer and                  software are available to students on an unscheduled basis,                     with several sets of laboratory exercises to be completed.                      These get students to go through the process of reducing their                  data after taking it.  Examples include determination of peak                   velocities at different Galactic longitudes to study Galactic                   rotation, and measurement of the basic form of the Galactic                     disk.  These projects greatly enhance the laboratory component                  of the course and thus the value of the course as a whole.",
