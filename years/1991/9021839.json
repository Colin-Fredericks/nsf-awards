 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of North Carolina at Charlotte for the renovation and                repair of Smith Engineering Building which houses that                          institution's civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering and                 computer science research and research training activities.  This               building was constructed in 1966 and has not been renovated since               that time.  The ARFMP grant of $200,000 and $200,850 provided by                the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these                     research and research training facilities and will help sustain                 the growth in and increasing technical demands of the research                  program of the College of Engineering.  This project will address               the need to improve the current research infrastructure by (a)                  providing better environmental control for the building,                        additional wiring to upgrade the data communications system                     between offices and laboratories in speed and capabilities, and                 space in the laboratories for graduate students; (b) locating or                reconfiguring many of the research laboratories and support shops               to achieve increased space with greater efficiency for use in new               projects; and (c) improving the security of the laboratories.                                                                                                   This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                   graduate students.  Engineering research at the University of                   North Carolina at Charlotte has turned in recent years to several               areas of significant national importance, including micro- and                  opto-electronics and computer-controlled manufacturing.  Students               trained in these laboratories, which will be better suited to such              studies as a result of the renovation, are in demand in both basic              and applied research fields.",
