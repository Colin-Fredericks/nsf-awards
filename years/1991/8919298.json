 "awd_abstract_narration": "The red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) is a well-known                  inhabitant of American marshes and fields.  Among birds, this                   species is somewhat unusual because of its mating system in which               one male attracts several females who nest within his territory.                Generally, such a mating system is associated with reduced male                 parental care, perhaps because males stand to gain more from                    getting more females than from caring for their young.  Male red-               winged blackbirds, however, care for their helpless and immobile                nestlings in three distinct ways:  They act as sentinels by                     sitting at prominent, exposed perches to look for potential                     predators; as defenders by harassing and attacking predators that               are searching for prey; and as providers by feeding their                       nestlings.  In some populations, such as the one to be studied,                 the male's parental care is substantial and effective in                        improving the health and survival of the young.                                                                                                                 Dr. Yasukawa's research will examine the causes and effects of                  paternal investment in nestling red-winged blackbirds.  Both                    observations and experiments will be conducted, and all research                will be carried out in the field on a wild population with                      minimal disturbance to the birds.  Much of the research will be                 performed by undergraduate students, who will make significant                  contributions to all aspects of the project and get valuable                    experience in scientific field work.",
