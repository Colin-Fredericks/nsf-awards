Tracy;  Dissertation Title:  \"The                    Medicalization of Alcoholism in America, 1870-1919.\"                                                                                                            Under the direction of Dr. Charles Rosenberg, Ms Tracy is                       undertaking a socio-historical study of the late 19th and early                 20th century attempt to \"medicalize\" alcohol abuse and alcoholism,              what was then called inebriety.  She is examining a random sample               of patient records from the Massachusetts Hospital for Dipsomaniacs             and Inebriates at the Massachusetts State Archives, newspaper                   accounts of the hospital found in The Foxborough Reporter contained             in the Foxborough Town Library, and the incompetency hearings of                inebriates from the New York County Court of Common Pleas contained             in the Division of Old Records at the New York County Clerk's                   Office in New York City.  These sources provide crucial insight                 into 1) the manner in which the medical understanding of inebriety              altered legal practice and social welfare policy;  2) the validity              of the social control hypothesis as a guiding principle in the                  institutional treatment of inebriates; 3) the currency of the                   disease concept of inebriety within urban judicial and social                   welfare systems;  4) the influence of such variables as gender,                 ethnicity, and socio-economic status on the classification and                  treatment of inebriates in a court of law and an institution                    specifically for the management of people with alcohol problems.                                                                                                This study promises significant contributions to the history of                 science and to our understanding of social control processes and                the interaction of law and medicine.  The data collected in this                study will be placed in a social science archive within one                     calendar year of the completion of this award.",
