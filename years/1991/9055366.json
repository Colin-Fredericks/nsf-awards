 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project TEAM (Technology, Empowerment, and Mathematics) is a                    three-year effort to enhance mathematics learning of                            elementary and middle school students, through teacher                          enhancement, in the Boston Public Schools. TEAM builds on the                   successful NSF-funded EMAT (Elementary Mathematics and                          Technology) Project, which also was conducted in Boston. The                    project will complete the preparation of two mathematics                        teacher leaders in every elementary school in Boston and will                   develop a cadre of middle school mathematics teacher leaders                    in each of Boston's middle schools. In each year of the                         project, a cadre of forty teachers (20 elementary, 20 middle                    school) will participate in a two-week summer institute,                        followed by monthly meetings during the academic year.                          Leadership teams will be established within each cadre.                         Academic year activity includes implementation of project                       ideas in participants' classroom, continued inservice each                      month, and telecommunications networking among participants.                    In the second and third years of the project, participants                      will conduct inservice activities with Eisenhower support at                    the local level. Typical sessions in the previous project were                  15 hours long. Existing curriculum material produced in the                     Boston area will serve as a basis for teacher adaptation and                    revision.                                                                                                                                                       The project is initiated by the Boston Public Schools, and                      involves collaboration with mathematics educators at Boston                     University and the University of Massachusetts at Boston. Cost                  sharing is provided by the Boston Public Schools as 76% of the                  NSF award.",
