 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to purchase a compact, lightweight                    rangefinder for use on a robot arm.  The research supported by the              arm with the rangefinder includes the development of algorithms to              recover superquadrics from depth data, evaluation of the quality of             various \"shape-from-\" algorithms, investigation of the use of real-             time sensor feedback to control assembly and parts mating                       activities using a hand mounted scanner, and the development of                 algorithms using the sensor data for intelligent grasping tasks.                                                                                                The use of multiple information sources is characteristic of much               of the current research in robotics.  A rangefinder, capable of                 real time data acquisition, mounted on a robot arm provides the                 capability, through moving the arm, of obtaining accurate three                 dimensional surface data.  Two distinct types of research are                   supported under this award.  The first is the development of                    algorithms that will use the rangefinder and the robot arm motion               to obtain three dimensional information, in real time, about the                objects being examined.  The second type of research is to                      incorporate the additional information into algorithms for grasping             and assembling objects.",
