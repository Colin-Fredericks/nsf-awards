 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research                             project between Dr. Frank Tittel of Williiam Marsh                              Rice University and Dr. Zsolt Por of JATE University,                           Szeged, is to pursue two related topics:  1) novel                              ultrashort laser pulse techniques and 2) production                             of nanostructures using direct laser ablation or                                photochemical processing.  These efforts are                                    intended to contribute to development of new                                    broadband ultrashort laser pulse amplifiers, and to                             advance our understanding of the production of                                  nanostructures using direct laser ablation.                                     Results of this project should contribute to our                                knowledge of basic physical mechanisms of UV laser                              ablation of polymers and should offer insight on such                           important questions as whether new photochemically                              induced absorbers are formed by direct photo                                    dissociation, radical formation after a chemical                                reaction, or other photochemical processes.                                     Results may lead to refinements for an interferometer                           capable of producing nanostructures in organic                                  materials by direct laser etching.                                                                                                                              This project in quantum electronics, waves and beams                            fulfills the program objective of advancing                                     scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers                            in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                              complementary talents and pool research resources                               in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
