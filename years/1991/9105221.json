 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study some problems in                     algebraic geometry related to partial differential equations.                   Systems of partial differential equations may be formulated as an               integrable system. The solutions of the partial differential                    equation are realized as integrable manifolds of the system. It is              this formulation of systems of partial differential equations which             makes the application of methods from algebraic geometry possible.                   Systems of partial differential equations play an important                role in models of physical systems. An important example is in the              area of control theory in which one would like to guide an object               along a desired trajectory. The system of partial differential                  equations used to model this situation can be formulated as an                  integrable system. The research supported by this award should be               particularly useful in studying this problem.",
