 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large portion of the genetic material in pollen                               (microgametophytes) is read off during pollen development, pollen               germination and pollen tube growth.  Consequently, the                          performance of pollen (speed of germination, pollen tube growth                 rate and ability to achieve fertilization) can potentially be                   affected by its genetic makeup, by its interactions with the                    material portion of the flower through which it grows, by                       environmental conditions such as temperature, and by the                        resources (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorus) provided to pollen                     grains by the pollen-producing parent.  Drs. Stephenson and                     Winsor will continue their detailed investigations of the factors               that affect pollen performance.  They will determine if these                   factors result in non-random fertilization, and if non-random                   fertilization affects the performance of the progeny.                           Specifically, they will use Cucurbita texana to examine the                     extent to which pollen tube growth can be selected for by allowing              only the fastest growing tubes to achieve fertilization.  Next,                 they will examine the effects of variation in the amount of soil                phosphorus on pollen production, pollen grain size, the quantity                of stored phosphorus in pollen, and the performance of pollen                   (ability to sire seeds in mixtures).  Finally, they will separate               the effects of temperature during pollen production from the                    effects of temperature during pollen germination on pollen                      performance.  These experiments, when combined with prior and                   ongoing studies, will result in a complete picture of the genetic               and environmental factors that influence pollen performance, the                non-random transmission of genes from one generation to the next,               and their effects on the resulting progeny.                                                                                                                     The results of these studies will address and clarify some of the               most actively debated issues in plant population biology.  In                   addition, this research will have far-reaching implications for the             applied sciences.  The possibility of using pollen to select for                agriculturally desirable traits in the pollen represents a                      considerable savings of time, money and space over both traditional             breeding programs and the newer biotechnology programs.  Finally,               it may be possible to use pollen to monitor environmental                       degradation, to determine which species are susceptible to                      particular forms of pollution, and to develop lines of plants that              are more resistant.",
