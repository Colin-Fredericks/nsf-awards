 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will continue his               fine work on problems that lie on the border between harmonic                   analysis and partial differential equations.  The main goal of                  his work is the description of harmonic measure for the exterior                of a convex domain.  A key question is to provide a bound on the                second variation of the electrostatic capacity that is analgous                 to the Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the volume.  Other topics                 for study are the behavior of nodal lines of eigenfunctions of                  free boundary problems, mixed boundary value problems in                        Lipschitz domains and L-p estimates for Airy-type operators.                         The two subjects of harmonic analysis and partial                          differential equations figure prominently in the branch of                      mathematics known as classical analysis.  Indeed, harmonic                      analysis grew out of Fourier analysis, which was developed to                   help solve various types of partial differential equations.  In                 this project the principal investigator will work on problems                   that span both of these areas.                                                       In particular, he will try to describe the harmonic measure                of the exterior of a convex domain and he will study various                    types of boundary value problems using techniques from the theory               of harmonic functions.",
