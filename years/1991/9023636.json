 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                             Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Pierpont will                 continue studies on transition metal complexes that contain                     electroactive organic ligands.  The synthesis and                               characterization of transition metal complexes that contain                     catecholate, semiquinone, and related electroactive organic                     ligands will be pursued.  These complexes exhibit selective                     redox activity at either the metal or ligand, thus allowing                     investigation of intramolecular metal-quinone electron transfer                 reactions.  The photochemical and photophysical properties of                   quinone complexes of the platinum group metals will be                          examined.  Multinuclear complex ensembles will be investigated                  for their activity as catalysts in photoconversion processes.                   Electronic effects in intramolecular metal-quinone electron                     transfer reactions and their potential involvement with                         bioinorganic reactions will be studied in functional models for                 metalloenzymatic processes.                                                     %%%                                                                             Catechols, quinones and other quinoid molecules are common                      components of biological systems, in which they usually                         function in association with metal ions.   In some cases these                  molecules function in the binding and transport of metals, and                  in other cases their metal complexes have a role in electron                    transfer and/or substrate activation.  The semiquinone and                      catecholate metal complexes which will be synthesized in this                   project will serve as models of the similar natural molecules.",
