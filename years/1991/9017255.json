 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research is to elucidate the mechanism of action                of the carrier molecule in a substrate-cation cotransport system                in the bacterium E. coli, with specific focus on the melobiose                  carrier.  Isolation of spontaneous mutants deficient in cation                  recognition and sugar recognition will be followed by analysis of               their physiological abnormalities in membrane transport.  The                   physiological effects of amino-acid substitution in the carrier                 molecule, particularly in membrane-spanning regions, will be                    examined.  Use of site-directed mutagenesis is expected to provide              an experimental test of the \"helical hairpin\" hypothesis for                    insertion of the melobiose carrier into membranes.  Other studies               will employ polyclonal antibodies in an attempt to determine the                orientation of presumed \"loop\" regions of the carrier in the                    membrane.                                                                                                                                                       The means whereby small molecules such as sugars and inorganic ions             gain entrance to cells through the lipid-rich cell membrane is a                matter of fundamental interest and importance; active transport                 across membranes often involves specific carrier molecules and it               is one of these--the melobiose carrier--that is the focus of this               research.  The goal of the project is to understand the molecular               aspects of the carrier molecule that permit it to bind specifically             to some molecules and not others, and to be inserted into cell                  membranes in a manner that permits cotransport of sugars and                    cations in appropriate directions.                                               //",
