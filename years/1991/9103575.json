 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the properties of a continuous neural                 network that has already been shown to successfully solve certain               problems in pattern classification.  The mathematical model for                 this network was derived using only the most basic assumptions;                 namely, that a neural network is a collection of interacting                    elements, each one affected positively or negatively by some                    subset of the others, and such that the system as a whole is                    capable of adapting its behavior over time.  The resulting                      mathematical model is an autonomous system of ordinary                          differential equations, and can therefore be analyzed by known                  analytic and numerical techniques.  For appropriate values of the               parameters it can be shown that an N-cell network will have N                   stable attractors.  One of the major goals of this project is                   the determination of the attractive basins of these attractors                  and a description of their dependence on the various system                     parameters. This information will then be used to determine the                 properties of a neural network having these N-cell networks as                  components.                                                                          Neural networks are currently being applied to certain                     kinds of problems that have not yielded to traditional techniques               of artificial intelligence, for example speech recognition and                  computer vision.  As yet, there is no general agreement on                      which neural network architectures work best.  It is possible                   that hybrid systems, consisting of interconnected components                    with different architectures, may be one solution.  It is in this               spirit that the network proposed here is being studied.  It has                 some useful properties not possessed by other networks; for                     example, it automatically identifies the component of an input                  vector that is most distinct from all of the others, whether it                 is smaller or larger.  As one of the few models in which the                    weights vary continuously in time as a function of the activity                 levels, it has in these weights a built-in short-term memory                    capability.  A careful comparison of this model with other neural               networks in current use needs to be made, to determine whether it               has properties that make it significantly better in particular                  applications.",
