 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the past few years it has become increasingly                            common for electrical and optical systems to involve                            signals that vary on time scales of a few picoseconds                           or less, and the development of techniques which can                            reliably and economically produce, model, and                                   measure such pulses is a matter of considerable                                 practical importance.  In spite of this activity,                               however, the majority of short pulse optical systems                            are still only partially and qualitatively understood,                          and the laser literature contains numerous                                      experimental observations which have not yet been                               interpreted.  The purpose of the theoretical and                                experimental studies in our proposed research is to                             develop a more rigorous understanding of the                                    dynamical behavior of short pulse laser systems.  The                           specific systems to be studied include dye lasers,                              which are the most common sources for picosecond                                pulses.  In addition, dynamical models will be                                  developed for the commercially important but                                    incompletely characterized semiconductor diode                                  lasers.  The increased insight resulting from this                              program will lead to more efficient and reliable                                sources of short optical pulses, means for eliminating                          those pulses when they are undesirable, and perhaps                             to pulses with characteristics that are not now                                 available.",
