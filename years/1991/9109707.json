 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies the design of public institutions and the                 relationship between institutional characteristics and the public               policies adopted by those institutions.  The former focuses on the              design of institutional arrangements, such as the price-cap systems             and the privatization arrangements being used by various countries              in telecommunications, taking into account both economic and                    political incentives.  The approach treats the ability of                       governments to commit to a long-run incentive system as endogenous              and depending on the political action of interest groups as                     triggered by information released over time through the performance             of the incentive system.  For parliamentary systems, the objective              is to develop a theory in which political parties, coalition                    governments, and policy formation are endogenous functions of                   electoral and legislative institutions.                                                                                                                         For the U.S., parties are perhaps less important than in                        parliamentary systems, and interest groups interact more with                   individual legislators than with parties.  In the U.S. context, the             objective is to investigate the role of interest groups in                      influencing policies through lobbying and election finance.                                                                                                     The overall objective of this research program is to provide a                  political economy theory of the public control of firms and markets             as a function of the structure of the political system.  The                    research will have a significant impact on our understanding of                 regulation, political institutions such as electoral laws and                   parliamentary governments, interest group activity, and electoral               competition.",
