 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Price will consider some questions in the theory of              operator algebras related to the index theory for semigroups of                 endomorphisms.  In this work Professor Price will continue his work             with Jorgensen on their extension of the Arveson-Powers index to a              setting which assigns an index to certain derivations on operator               algebras.  He expects to continue his work with Powers on a related             problem of analyzing the generator extensions of the second                     quantization of a symmetric unbounded operator.  He also will study             isomorphism invariants for a class of operator algebras whose                   structure resembles that of a one parameter family of Cuntz                     algebras.  Finally Price will continue his project of acquainting               undergraduates with certain research topics involving operator                  algebras.                                                                            Professor Price's project involves self-adjoint operator                   algebras.  These objects consist of families of Hilbert space                   operators (infinite matrices of complex numbers) which have an                  interesting property: the algebra is generated by operators whose               value in any state on the algebra is a real number.  This property              makes these algebras important for physics and indeed physics was               the original motivation for their study.",
