 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of the retina to regenerate in amphibians, teleosts                 and embryonic chicks is a particularly striking example of                      central nervous system repair following traumatic damage.  In                   chick, the source of new retinal neural precursor cells in the                  regenerative process has been identified as the retinal pigmented               epithelium.   However, with increasing development the pigmented                epithelium of the chick embryo loses its ability to generate                    neuronal cells.  To study molecular mechanisms underlying this                  transdifferentiation and loss of regenerative capacity, the                     embryonic chick pigmented epithelium will be studied in a tissue                culture system.  The role of the extracellular matrix molecules,                laminin and basic fibroblast growth factor, on                                  transdifferentiation will be studied. Neuronal cells will be                    identified with antibodies to neuron specific markers.  In                      addition, the polymerase chain reaction will be used to determine               whether the GAP-43 or neurofilament genes are expressed.  It also               will be determined whether pigmented epithelium loses its                       regenerative capacity in the in vitro system.  In addition, the                 expression of neuronal phenotype will be studied in relation to                 the expression of two chick genes that are homologous to the                    neural determination genes of the achaete scute complexes that                  play a role in neural determination in the fruit fly.  These                    studies have the potential for identifying genes that play a role               in the determination, as well as the regeneration, of retina.",
