 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disturbance is nearly ubiquitous in ecological systems.                    Consequently, succession, the process of recovery from                          disturbance, is responsible for much variation in ecosystem                     structure and function.  The primary objective of this research                 is to understand the process of succession, and the investigators               assert that most successional changes in community-level                        properties and processes can best be understood as resulting from               population processes.                                                                Although permanent plots are commonly used to examine the                  dynamics of mature trees, seedling and sapling dynamics remain                  virtually unstudied, simply because appropriate data have not                   been available.  With the support of the National Science                       Foundation Long-term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB)                  program, the investigators have collected seedling and sapling                  data from permanent plots in numerous types and ages of forests                 with observations ranging up to 13 years.  Consequently the                     investigators are uniquely positioned to examine the dynamics of                seedlings and saplings as related to succession and site                        characteristics.                                                                     The LTREB dataset will be used to address questions related                to the dynamics of seedlings and samplings such as the following:               (1) How do seedling and sapling establishment, growth, and                      survival vary with succession and site conditions?  (2) Is                      seedling-seedling competition significant?  We suspect that                     competition with canopy trees controls seedling dynamics, except                in canopy gaps, but if seedling interactions are important they                 will need to be added to forest simulation models.  (3) Do canopy               trees differentially inhibit conspecific seedlings and saplings?                This is a popular hypothesis, largely untested in temperate                     forest.  (4) Can year-to-year climatic variation explain co-                    existence of similar tree species?  Again, this a popular but                   untested hypothesis.  (5) Does seedling vigor change during                     succession in a fashion consistent with existing models of                      changing canopy-derived competition (see Peet and Christensen                   1987)?                                                                               This research will provide a unique perspective on                         successional patterns from a population standpoint.",
