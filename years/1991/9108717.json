 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the late 1970's, increasing international competition,                    technological change, a deep recession, and changes in the                      composition of demand haver led to the displacement of millions of              workers from their jobs because of plant closings or large-scale                reductions in operations.  The adaptability of displaced workers,               is an important component of the economy's overall response to                  structural change.  The purpose of this project is to analyze the               determinants of industrial and occupational mobility and post-                  displacement joblessness and earnings.  Differences between blacks              and whites in industrial and occupational mobility will also be                 examined.  The study will analyze job search with a two sector                  model which will be estimated using data from the Displaced Worker              Surveys.  Questions of industrial and occupational change introduce             sample selection issues and these concerns will be addressed in the             empirical analysis.  This research is supported under the Research              at Undergraduate Institutions Program, and the project is important             because it may provide new insights for the design of labor market              policies.",
