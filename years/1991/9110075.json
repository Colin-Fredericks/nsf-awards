 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the fast deployment of fiber optics as a transmission                 medium, a speed mismatch problem has been created between                       transmission and switching.  In recent years, the speed of                      transmission facilities has been improved by several orders of                  magnitude.  In comparison, the progress made in switching seems to              be relatively slow.  To meet the challenges posed by the                        increasing transmission speed, laboratories around the world are                working on new photonic and fast electronic switching devices.                  These recent developments will heavily influence the future                     direction of switching research.  But it is universally recognized              that advances in switching devices are not enough; new                          architectures are needed.  The component-by-component approach                  simply cannot make the best use of the new technology.                               The purpose of this research is to explore novel                           architectures and design paradigms for constructing high-speed                  switching systems which can harness the recent advances in the                  switching technology.  Specifically, a new class of switching                   networks has been identified which possess the following                        characteristics:  self-routing, fault-tolerance, easy path hunt,                easy fault-diagnosis and low crosstalk for the directionalcouplers              implementation.  They are very promising for high speed switching.              The research is expected to lead to development of new                          multicast-multirate electronic and photonic switching                           architectures and performance models based on this new class of                 networks.",
