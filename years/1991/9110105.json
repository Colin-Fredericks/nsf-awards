 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Planning Grants are one-time awards designed to help              increase the number of new women investigators participating in NSF             researchprograms, and to facilitate preliminary studies and other               activities related to the development of competitive NSF research               proposals.                                                                           The project investigates the issues of call routing for                    integrated broadband networks in a multilayer control framework.                The Principal Investigator is developing models to predict the                  network performance, algorithms and software to achieve optimal                 performance.  The study involves the following issues:                               -How much bandwidth is required to satisfy a certain grade of                    service for the purposes of call admission and routing?                        -How should the probability of blocking be quantified as a                       function                                                                        of the current state and traffic statistics?                                   -For a given set of paths, how the calls should be routed                        dynamically according to the degree of congestion of these                      paths.                                                                         -Stability of such dynamic routing methods.                                     Markov decision theory is used in finding optimum routing                  policies.",
