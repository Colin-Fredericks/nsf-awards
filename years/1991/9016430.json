 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs proposed a study of the taxonomy, pattern of phylogenetic               relationships and evolutionary processes in Jaltomata.  A                       neotropical, herbaceous to suffrutescent genus of the Solanaceae.               One species of this poorly understood and taxonomically confused                genus is of particular interest because it is undergoing                        progressive domestication in Mexico as a fruit crop; fruits and                 root-stocks of several other species are also consumed by humans.               The PIs will construct a chloroplast DNA-based phylogeny.  Based                on this rigorously constructed phylogeny, independently derived                 patterns of morphological and karyotypical evolution and                        biogeography will be tested.  They will also explore evolution of               breeding systems.  Jaltomata is especially suitable for the study               of evolutionary process and pattern for several reasons.  Generic               boundaries present a challenging problem; some workers retain the               tubular flowered Jaltomata species as Hebecladus, and species of                Saracha and Physalis have been treated as Jaltomata.  There is                  much morphological diversity among species (habit, vestiture,                   corolla shape and color, etc.).  The group, therefore, lends                    itself to the study of morphological evolution as it relates to                 phylogeny, chromosomal evolution, the evolution of altitude /                   habitat preference and breeding system evolution.  The genus                    includes a diversity of breeding systems such as autogamy,                      facultative autogamy, and obligate outcrossing.",
