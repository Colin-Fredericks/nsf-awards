 "awd_abstract_narration": "The John Day Formation of the Pacific Northwest includes                   volcanic deposits interlayered with terrestrial strata, in which                plants and animals from the Tertiary Epoch are preserved.  The                  Condon Museum of the University of Oregon houses more than 32,000               fossil vertebrates from the John Day beds of Oregon, as well as                 plant and invertebrate fossils that cover a wider spectrum of                   geologic ages.  This collection ranks as an important resource                  for paleontological research, and Dr. William Orr, Curator of the               collection, proposes significant improvements in its condition.                 The collection will be installed in high density compactorized                  storage units in newly renovated quarters, and will be                          inventoried and reorganized in the process.  A computer database                of the collection's contents will be implemented, thereby                       providing the research community with better access to these                    important fossils.                                                                   Regionally important collections such as the Condon Museum                 are critical elements of the nation's research infrastructure.                  They provide easier access by researchers and students within the               region, and they support advanced training in systematics,                      ecology, and evolutionary biology.  These and other advantages                  would be lost if regional collections were to be subsumed into a                few national repositories.  The proposed collection improvement                 will enhance important paleontological research and graduate                    training, and preserve part of our nation's natural heritage.",
