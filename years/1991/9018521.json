 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the atomic and electronic                       properties of tetrahedrally coordinated compound semiconductor                  surfaces and their interfaces with metals.  The technologically                 important (100) surfaces grown by molecular beam epitaxy will be                studied in addition to II-VI wurtzite surfaces.  The work will                  focus on an in depth investigation of photoemission induced                     surface photovoltage and its implications on the validity of the                present Schottky barrier models in addition to the structural                   characteristics of (100) interfaces.  The study of gallium                      antimonide surfaces and their interfaces with a wide range of                   metals.  Following the successful determination of the atomic                   structure of (1120) and (1010) wurtzite cadmium selenide and                    sulfide studies will be initiated of their interfaces with                      totally reactive species such as antimony and bismuth.  The                     objective is to identify atomically ordered and abrupt model                    interfaces which can be employed in experimental and theoretical                studies of the role of the overlayer electronic structure,                      interface bonding, dangling bonds and local defects in the                      formation of Schottky barriers on these compounds.",
