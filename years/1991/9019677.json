 "awd_abstract_narration": "The academic development of tomorrow's mathematicians                         require a vision of the future and a program to achieve that                    vision.  Spelman College has that vision.  The project                          \"Scholars in Mathematics at Spelman (SIMS) will provide a                       comprehensive research and academic enrichment program for                      talented minority  women students.  The overall objective of                    the program is to develop an academic  environment that                         assures the preparedness of minority women as they pursue                       degrees in mathematics at the best graduate schools throughout                  the country.  The students selected to participate in the                       program will be mathematics majors that have demonstrated                       potential for earning a graduate degree in pure or applied                      mathematics.  Each student's academic program at Spelman will                   include   enrichment activities such as participation in a                      research issues course, supervised mathematics research,                        seminar participation, and conference attendance.                                 During the first year, four students will be selected for                     the program:  two sophomores and two juniors.  Subsequently,                    two rising sophomores will be selected immediately following                    the spring semester each year of the grant.  Each student will                  engage in at least two years of research experience with                        faculty advisors culminating in a written thesis.  Two summer                   research experiences will include at least one internship at                    an off-campus research facility or university.",
