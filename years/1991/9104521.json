 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Mary Rakowski-DuBois of the Chemistry Department,                           University of Colorado at Boulder, is supported by the                          Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program                   for investigation of C=O, C-S, and C-N bond cleavage reactions                  promoted by transition metal complexes containing sulfide                       ligands.  In the case of C=O, for example, it is expected that                  carbon monoxide would insert into an SH bond of an SH ligand                    which serves as a bridge for a molybdenum dimer.  The                           formylthiolate thus produced is susceptible to reductive                        cleavage of the C=O bond by hydrogen. This could model a first                  step of the conversion of CO to methane, a reaction not                         commonly promoted by transition metal complexes, and here                       promoted by bonding to sulfur rather than to the metal.  This                   study might provide insight into the mechanism of CO reduction                  catalyzed by heterogeneous molybdenum sulfides.  In studies of                  C-N bond cleavage by hydrogen, the sulfided metal complexes                     would serve as models of the heterogeneous catalysts used in                    commercial HDN (hydrodenitrogenation) processes. In addition to                 the reactions described above, novel complexes containing Ir,                   Rh, Re, Mo, and Mo-Cr and a variety of sulfur- and                              nitrogen-containing ligands will be prepared.                                   %%%                                                                             This project is expected to provide insight into the reactions                  of transition metal complexes with small molecules, which are                   important in the use of such complexes as heterogeneous and                     homogeneous catalysts.  Specifically, these studies may provide                 information pertinent to understanding the behavior of                          commercial heterogeneous catalysts used for                                     hydrodenitrogenation.",
