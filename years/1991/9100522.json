 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of                    California - San Diego, will receive support for shipboard                      technician activities associated with the four research                         vessels operated by the University.  A significant portion of                   the ships' operating schedules in recent years and again in                     1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The                     Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea                      component and an ashore component.                                                                                                                              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                         personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; maint-                      enance, repair, and calibration of scientific instrumenta-                      tion; instruction and supervision of deck operations; and                       providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going                       scientific parties.  On shore activities include the mainten-                   ance, repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equip-                     ment and assisting scientific personnel in preparing for                        field work on the vessel.  Shipboard technicians funded by                      this award have broad responsibilities for providing the                        coordination and assistance needed for the successful                           completion of research projects at sea.  The level of                           activity and amount of support are closely related to the                       size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                    and capability.",
