 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept described herein is an advanced holographic                         diffractive structure (HDS) for the control of light at the                     wavelength level.  A stack of electrically controllable, liquid-                crystal filled diffraction gratings would present a lightweight,                clear panel, that, when placed in contact with an aperture shall                be able to concentrate sunlight very efficiently into a stable                  area in the center of a light guide or fiber optic device.  It                  shall be possible to selectively bring into play only the grating               appropriate for a particular sun angle and none other, by                       applying an electric field (creating a \"smart grating\").  A                     series of such concentrators will thus display active solar                     tracking without the disadvantages associated with moving                       mechanical parts.                                                                                                                                               An example of a highly promising application of such a device is                described within--holographic collection and transport of                       sunlight to a multi-story building's \"core\" area.  Substituting                 sunlight for electric light will conserve a significant quantity                of energy, particularly during peak load conditions, while at the               same time delivering high quality illumination to the building's                occupants.  It is anticipated that the control device described                 herein, could provide formidable energy savings in the U.S.                     building sector by the year 2000.",
