The             college leads the nation in total degrees conferred and is                      recognized as a major international center of excellence in both                undergraduate and graduate education, offering an array of research             opportunities unmatched in scope and quality.  A comprehensive                  package of financial incentives and programmatic services and                   activities will be aimed at recruiting persons from                             underrepresented groups into a PhD program and supporting them to               degree completion.  SURGE will admit ten new participants each year             and provide support to each for five years.  The SURGE pipeline                 will reach steady-state capacity of 40 in the fifth year.  SURGE                will increase Black and Hispanic enrollment in all doctoral                     programs by 300% and also increase the number of women and persons              with disabilities.  In each participant's first year, SURGE will                provide a $15,000 stipend (with no requirement of service) and                  payment of tuition and fees.  In subsequent years SURGE will                    supplement the teaching or research assistantships up to the                    $15,000 per year level.",
