In accomplishing (3), the OP project will continue, during                      the next three years, to train and support three member                         teams of qualified individuals to lead physics inservice                        programs for 4th-8th grade teachers in their local areas                        using workshop kits especially developed for the project.                       These inservice program will provide upper elementary and                       middle school teachers of science with a better                                 understanding of the physics topics typically included in                       their science curriculum, and supply them with ideas for                        effectively teaching their students about these topics.                                                                                                         Leadership training programs are planned in each state, with                    the exception of Texas, South Carolina, and Connecticut                         which have already completed such programs.  Most will be                       held during the summer on a college or university campus,                       and range from 1-4 weeks in lengths.  Program presenters                        will include national OP staff and teams of outstanding                         science educators who participated in the 1988 or 1989                          national OP program; all presenters have conducted numerous                     successful OP workshops with 4th-8th grade teachers.                            Support for OP leadership training programs is being                            provided from the National Science Foundation as well as                        from state and local funding sources and the American                           Institute of Physics.                                                                                                                                           Individuals applying for participation must be professional                     active science educators with expertise in physics and/or                       pre-secondary science education.  Each participant will                         receive a comprehensive set of workshop materials for each                      physics topic to use in planning and conducting inservice OP                    programs.  Travel, subsistence, stipends and other support                      for the training programs very from state to state.  Program                    participants will be required to conduct a minimum number of                    inservice workshops for target audience teachers after the                      training program, and to participate in planned follow-up                       activities.  These peer-led workshops will introduce a large                    multiplier effect for OP inservice activities.
