 "awd_abstract_narration": "This eighteen-month project is designed to help teachers                        gain insights into their students' mathematical cognition.                      The project will develop assessment techniques which                            teachers in grades 2 and 3 may use to learn about their                         students' mathematics thinking and learning in the                              classroom.  The clinical interview, a technique normally                        used only as a research methodology in developmental and                        educational psychology, will serve as the basis for the                         development of the assessment techniques.  Skilled teachers                     will participate in the development; four diverse school                        districts have agreed to participate in a substantive way in                    the project.  Project activities include: a series of three                     workshops for teachers and supervisors introducing educators                    to general concepts concerning children's mathematics                           learning and understanding, focusing in particular on second                    and third grade learners, and introducing the ideas of                          clinical interviewing. (The workshops will be based                             primarily on the materials for teachers developed in TEI-",
