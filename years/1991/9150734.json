 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops innovative materials and methods for                      teaching communication skills in a variety of engineering                       courses from the first through senior years. The project                        integrates the teaching of communication skills with the                        teaching of the problem solving skills typical in engineering.                  Instructional materials that can be used by engineering faculty                 themselves, including non-native speakers of English, are                       produced.  To supplement present methods of teaching                            communication skills and to address unmet needs, \"communication                 skills modules\" that engineering professors can use in their                    courses without significant extra effort on their part and                      indeed that will complement instruction in engineering problem                  solving skills, are developed. The modules address written,                     oral, visual, and interpersonal communication skills.  The                      project provides a prototype for modification of the                            engineering curriculum to teach communication skills in                         engineering courses.",
