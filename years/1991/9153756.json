 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project LEARN will open a working national laboratory to 40                     middle/junior-high school teachers, giving them first-hand                      experience in what it is like to do science.  It will invite                    five-member teacher teams from eight varied urban and rural                     districts in California, Colorado, North Carolina, and                          Texas.  One team member will be a master teacher, and the                       others will be promising but less experienced; the project                      especially targets population groups underrepresented in                        scientific professions.                                                                                                                                         The teachers will attend three consecutive summer workshops                     at the National Center for Atmosphere Research (NCAR), where                    they will do experiments, bolster their understanding of                        background scientific concepts, and learn effective hands-on                    methodologies.  With guidance from the principal                                investigators, from master teachers, and from NCAR                              scientists, they will translate what they learn into                            classroom activities for their own districts, with their                        different curricula and different student populations.                                                                                                          Project LEARN will also provide leadership training, so as                      to prepare teachers to lead inservices in their home                            districts and to catalyze change in district-wide teaching                      strategies.  As each participant excites colleagues who                         attend district inservices and they all change the way they                     teach, the benefits of Project LEARN will be greatly                            multiplied.                                                                                                                                                     In the fourth and final year of the project a one-week                          workshop will focus on intensive leadership training for                        giving peer-led workshops.  It will synthesize experiences                      gained by teachers in the two previous years as they led                        such workshops and plan a third inservice for their local                       district.  The intent is that such inservices can become a                      regular part of the districts professional development                          program.                                                                                                                                                        Cost sharing equals 47% of the NSF award.",
