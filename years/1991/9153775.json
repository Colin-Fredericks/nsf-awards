 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Michigan seeks funds for a three-year                         program to enhance 60 high school mathematics teachers by                       strengthening their understanding of mathematical concepts                      and effective pedagogy and by applying this knowledge and                       skill in a tutorial program for college-bound students in                       need of remediation in mathematics.  Both participants and                      the college-bound tutees will be selected from among urban-                     based schools with large numbers of underrepresented and                        underachieving students in mathematics.  Each year, twenty                      teachers will participate in a four-week summer workshop and                    academic year follow-up activities.  Topics to be addressed                     include statistics, computer usage, graphing, interrelating                     mathematical concepts, cooperative learning, and motivating                     students.  The teachers will participate in videotape                           demonstrations of classroom techniques which will become                        part of a multimedia documentation of the program which can                     be used to replicate the enhancement model elsewhere.                                                                                                           University of Michigan and local schools' contribution                          accounts for 7% of the NSF budget.  With careful                                documentation of the project, we can be informed about                          successful teacher enhancement for teachers in urban-based                      schools with large numbers of underrepresented and                              underachieving students of mathematics.",
