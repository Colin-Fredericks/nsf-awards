 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to The College of Sciences at San Diego               University to direct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates                  Site for Summer/Academic Years 1991-92, 1992-93, and 1993-94. The               program will provide undergraduate students with research                       experience in the laboratories of a strong group of molecular                   biologists who are faculty members of the Departments of Biology                and Chemistry.  Both plant and animal science areas are                         represented among the research interests of nineteen                            participating faculty members.                                                                                                                                  Eight students will participate for two months in the summer and                30 weeks in the following academic year.  Students will be                      selected from biology and chemistry majors at eight local                       community colleges as well as undergraduate colleges and                        universities in San Diego County, including San Diego State                     University.  Additionally, students will be recruited from                      Imperial Valley Community College and San Diego State                           University's Imperial Valley Campus (SDSU IVC).  The program                    design will permit students who commute from the Imperial Valley                to participate in all components of the program during summer and               on Tuesdays and Thursdays of the academic year through                          transportation by van to the main campus of the University.                     Imperial Valley institutions and three of the eight San Diego                   County community colleges have diverse ethnic student                           populations, especially black and Hispanic.  Consequently, the                  institutions selected for participation will assure access of                   under-represented minority students to the program.                                                                                                             Students will participate in laboratory activities for 40 hours                 per week in the summer and for 10 hours per week in the academic                year.  Both summer and academic year programs will include weekly               (summer) or bi-weekly (academic year) enrichment colloquia which                will introduce students to such topics as ethics in research,                   academic advising, and career planning.  Student-suggested                      science topics to improve understanding will be presented by                    appropriate faculty members, and the students themselves will                   report on their research activities to the group several times                  during the year.                                                                                                                                                The primary objective of this project is the encouragement and                  preparation of students to enter advanced, especially Ph.D.,                    degree programs in the sciences.  The components of the project                 should make these highly competitive for openings in a variety of               advanced degree programs.",
