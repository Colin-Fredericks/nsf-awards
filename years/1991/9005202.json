 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insect growth and metamorphosis is controlled primarily by the molting          hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20HE), and juvenile hormone (JH) which,            when present, prevents metamorphosis.  A neuropeptide, eclosion hormone,        then triggers ecdysis at the end of each molt.  During the next 5 years,        this project will focus on the action of these hormones in the context          of identified genes in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, and the             fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster.  The particular projects include: 1)         The spatial and temporal patterning of ecdysteroid receptors in the             epidermis during a larval molt and the larval-pupal transformation and          their relationship to the competence of the cells to respond to the             hormone.  2) Structural analysis of the gene for insecticyanin, the             pigment necessary for adaptive coloration, hormonal regulation of its           expression, and factors involved in the bidirectional secretion of this         protein.  3) The dual role (induction and repression) of 20HE in                determining the timing of expression of gene for dopa decarboxylase, the        enzyme necessary for cuticular melanization and hardening after ecdysis.        4) The role of ecdysteroid in the regulation of eclosion hormone gene           expression and of these two hormones in the onset of alcohol                    dehydrogenase gene expression at adult eclosion in Drosophila.                  These studies will clarify our understanding about how 20HE and JH act          together to regulate specific genes during a larval molt and at                 metamorphosis and how the changing ecdysteroid titer may coordinate the         onset of gene expression during a molt.  Furthermore, they will define          for the first time in a complex system how a neuropeptide and a steroid         hormone interact to control specific gene expression.  This in-depth            knowledge about the mode of action of these critical developmental              hormones should also serve as a basis for new approaches to insect              control.",
