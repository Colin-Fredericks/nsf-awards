 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small arteries control blood flow to various organs.  These                     arteries are normally contracted from which they dilate or                      constrict depending on the need for blood.  The arteries in the                 brain have a special requirement for blood flow; they must maintain             blood flow even when the blood pressure changes.  Calcium (Ca2+)                ions play a critical role in the narrowing and opening of arteries.             Ca2+ ions inside the muscle cells in the wall of the arteries cause             the muscle cells to contract and consequently cause blood vessels               to narrow.  We study the mechanism by which Ca2+ enters these                   muscle cells.  Ca2+ enters the smooth muscle through specialized                proteins that form pores through membrane that separate the outside             of the cell from the inside.  These pores are called \"calcium                   channels\" and are the targets of a major class of cardiovascular                drugs called \"calcium channel blockers\" that are used to treat                  hypertension, angina, and stroke.  The proposed project will                    examine the properties of \"calcium channels\" in arteries that                   regulate blood flow in the brain.  This should be the first study               of its kind and should provide vital information to the                         understanding of how the diameter of some of the most important                 arteries is regulated.  This study has been made possible by new                techniques to isolate small arteries and single smooth muscle of                genetic strain of rats called WKY.  The rats are anesthetized and               rapidly killed.  The arteries are then rapidly removed.  All                    experiments are done on the isolated arteries or single smooth                  muscle cells isolated from these arteries.  These studies should                be the first of their kind and should provide a foundation                      essential for understanding the regulation of Ca entry in tonic,                autoregulating arteries. //",
