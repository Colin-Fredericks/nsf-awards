 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal theme of this research is the development and                     application of deformable models for computer vision.  In                       contrast to traditional, purely geometric object models,                        deformable models simulate elastic material which change shape in               response to externally applied forces.  The main advantage of                   this approach is that it produces coherent object models where                  low level vision techniques often suffer from pixel artifacts and               may not yield closed object boundaries.  The work begins by                     extending existing surface-based models in two fundamental ways.                First, models are developed which can dynamically change to                     reflect the underlying topology of the object being modeled.                    This makes it possible to model object deformations with less                   complete and prior knowledge.  Second, the deformable models are                generalized so objects in higher dimensions can be modeled.  This               will enable scientists to study object behavior in time-sequence                images and gain an understanding of the mechanisms involved in                  object deformation.  In order to accurately model complex objects               in nature, computational methods are needed that are capable of                 handling models with hundreds of thousands of elements.  The                    approach combines two optimization techniques, simulated                        annealing and multiresolution analysis, to reduce both the time                 and space complexity of fitting deformable object models.  To                   evaluate effectiveness of the deformable models, the object                     modeling techniques are applied to several challenging biomedical               computer vision problems: image segmentation; shape description;                and object recognition.",
