 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electrochemical reduction of geminal dihalides in the                       presence of electrophilic reagents has several disadvantages                    (poor chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity) for the synthesis                 of mono-and bis-substituted materials.  The process will be                     catalyzed with cobalt (I) macrocyclic complexes, including                      vitamin B12, cobalt bis-salicylideneethylenediamine, and                        cobaloximes.  The strategy is to reduce the cobalt species to                   the reactive Co(I) state, which is expected to undergo rapid                    oxidative addition with a geminal dihalide in the medium.  The                  resulting adduct, a Co(III) species, will be reduced in situ to                 eject the desired carbanion for reaction with an electrophile                   in the medium.  In effect, the cobalt macrocycle will catalyze                  the reduction of the geminal halide to the corresponding                        alpha-halocarbanion.  The catalytic process is expected to                      occur in far higher stereoselectivity and chemoselectivity than                 the direct electrochemical process, and permit conversions not                  possible at all by the direct process.  Furthermore, by                         carrying out the electrolysis at potentials where oxidative                     addition to Co(I) takes place but the Co(III) adduct is stable,                 it will be possible to make radicals by thermal or                              photochemical decomposition of the latter.  A number of                         synthetic applications, including reductive electrophilic                       substitution on geminal dihalides (including both open chain                    and cyclic systems), synthesis of substituted cyclopropanes,                    arenes, and polycyclic systems, and synthesis of alkenes, based                 on these principles, will be undertaken. These principles will                  be further extended to electrocatalytic generation of                           carbanions from substrates other than alkyl halides.                                                                                                            The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting this research to                    develop cobalt macrocycle-catalyzed electrochemical coupling                    reactions.  This research will lead to a new and novel route to                 synthetically useful reactive intermediates that can be used to                 synthesize the increasingly complex substances needed in our                    economy.",
