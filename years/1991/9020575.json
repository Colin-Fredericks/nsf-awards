 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary purpose of the proposed program is to identify                      and prepare minority college students in the sciences and                       mathematics for careers at the graduate and professional                        levels.  To this end, a Research Careers for Minority                           Students (RCMS) training group with emphasis in cell and                        molecular biology, organic and pharmacal chemistry,                             mathematics, physics and engineering has been established at                    Howard University.  Details of the research program are shown                   in the body of the proposal.  The program targets college                       juniors and seniors and high school teachers.  Interfacing                      with ongoing pre-college science and mathematics programs                       (PEW/Rockefeller) and college programs (MARC/MBRS/Howard                        Hughes) will allow early identification and selection of                        highly competent trainees for the RCMS program.  Based upon                     academic performance, letters of recommendation, and degree                     of motivation program trainees who are selected at the end of                   their sophomore year, will be offered a summer internship in                    laboratories at Howard University where they will be exposed                    to an intense research regimen in the field of their major.                     The summer internship should provide them guidance and                          skills needed to attract them into a high-quality research                      program during the academic year.  Ten RCMS trainees will be                    identified in year one, and a total of 20 students will be                      carried by this program each succeeding year.  During the                       academic year, RCMS trainees will enroll in an undergraduate                    research course (3 cr) where they will work directly with a                     faculty mentor on his/her research subspecialty.",
