 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project on \"Growth of Diamond and Cubic Boron Nitride Single               Crystalline Films\" addresses experimental and theoretical aspects               of epitaxial crystal growth.  The homoepitaxial growth of diamond               films on different crystallographic surfaces of diamond substrates              will be studied using electron cyclotron resonance assisted                     molecular beam epitaxy.  The role of atomic hydrogen in stabilizing             certain surface reconstructions and in removing graphitic co-                   deposits will be investigated, as well as electron and ion assisted             growth and doping phenomena.  Transport, optical, and recombination             properties of the epitaxial films will be characterized.  Defects               will be studied by electron spin resonance, cathodoluminesence, and             Raman spectroscopy, and correlations between defect concentration               and growth rate will be investigated.  The results of these                     fundamental studies are of importance to the potential use of                   diamond and boron nitride in electronic applications with                       capabilities beyond silicon-based electronics enabling improved                 device and circuit performance, and extending electronic/photonic               applications to new areas such as sensor and processor utilization              in the high temperature environments of automobile and jet engines,             and for process control in manufacturing.",
