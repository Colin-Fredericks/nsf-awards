 "awd_abstract_narration": "Matchup scheduling is a strategy for overcoming disruptions                in large, complex scheduling systems.  It assumes that a                        preschedule has been constructed offline to set material and labor              schedules.  While operating the system, a disruption, such as                   machine breakdown or material unavailability, has rendered the                  preschedule obsolete. Matchup scheduling reconstructes a small                  section of the preschedule resulting in a feasible, near-optimal                schedule.  To execute this strategy, the schedule beyond a selected             matchup time is not altered.  Jobs on a subset of machines are                  rescheduled with the objective of matching up with the preschedule              at the matchup time.  That is, all inventories and machine setups               should be as if the disruption had not occurred.  It is assumed                 that this is possible due to slack in the preschedule for the                   disrupted family of machines.  It has been shown that, under quite              general conditions, such a process can be carried out without loss              of optimality.                                                                      It is the intent of this project to enhance this strategy by                (1) applying new theory to better choose the matchup  time, and (2)             enhancing the methods used for reconstructing the  schedule                     section.  The approach will be evaluated against optimal schedules              or bounds on optimal schedules.//",
