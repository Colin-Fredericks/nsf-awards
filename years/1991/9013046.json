 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well-established that a wide variety of organisms,                        including humans, have internal, biological clocks that are                     instrumental in allowing them to maintain synchrony to both daily               (i.e. circadian) and annual cycles of environmental change.  Most               mammals are exposed, on a daily basis, to environmental cues such               as sunrise and sunset or day/night temperature fluctuations.                    These cues are used to synchronize their internal clocks to local               environmental time.  To understand the biological time keeping                  systems used by mammals, Dr. Goldman examines animals in                        hibernation.  He will determine the hormonal and neural                         mechanisms that these animals use to time and coordinate the end                of hibernation.  Dr. Goldman's work will provide significant                    insights into understanding how the internal clocks continue to                 function in an environment where the animals remain sheltered for               a significant period from most environmental cues.  These results               will increase our understanding of the physiological mechanisms                 regulating the maintenance of internal clocks and, therefore, may               contribute to the development of treatments which would reduce                  the detrimental consequences associated with jetlag.",
