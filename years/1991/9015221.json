 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the energies of metal-oxygen bonds involved                    in reduction and reoxidation of an oxide are measured by                        calorimetry using a heat-flow calorimeter.  Heats of reduction                  are measured for reduction by carbon monoxide or by hydrogen;                   this permits calculation of heats of formation for metal-                       oxygen bonds using the known heats of formation of small                        molecules, or, if necessary, the mesured heat of reoxidation.                   If surface hydroxyls are formed, their heats of formation can                   also be determined.  Laser Raman spectroscopy, performed                        before and after the calorimetry, is used to identify and                       track the particular bonds made or broken in the calorimetric                   reactions.  Initial experiments are on the highly dispersed                     phases of vanadia supported or gamma-alumina and anatase                        (titania).                                                                                                                                                      Data on the energies of metal-oxygen bonds are not available.                   Such data should be very useful for understanding the                           catalysis and surface chemistry of oxides, particularly                         selective catalytic oxidation reactions in which the surface                    is the proximate source of oxygen; the effort proposed is a                     formidable task.  Selective oxidations are major elements in                    the production of a variety of commodity and specialty                          chemicals.  Although catalytic behavior is the focus of this                    study, the results will also contribute to understanding                        semiconductor surfaces and insulating layers in electronic                      materials, and passivation an corrosion in structrual                           materials.",
