 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Missouri Botanical Garden is one of the world's most                   important centers for botanical research and for curation of                    plant specimens.  The Curators of the Herbarium are leading                     researchers on tropical plants, and the collections amassed at                  the Garden represent an enormous and unique resource for                        research.  Botanists from around the world visit these                          collections and request specimens on loan, and access to these                  collections is critical for hundreds of current research                        projects.  Unfortunately, the rate at which new collections have                arrived has outpaced the Garden's ability to mount, identify,                   label, and file specimens in the collections.  More than 300,000                specimens have accumulated in \"backlog\", and the research                       community has expressed strong desire for access to these                       specimens.  Dr. Solomon will oversee an aggressive three-year                   campaign to eliminate this backlog, and to put in place                         curatorial procedures that will prevent future backlogs from                    accumulating.                                                                        Processing the specimen backlog at the Missouri Botanical                  Garden will benefit research collections around the world.                      Research into tropical biodiversity, medicinal use of native                    plants, ecological and evolutionary studies all rely on these                   collections, and processing the backlog into accessible                         collections will make the Garden's Herbarium collection a more                  comprehensive research resource.",
