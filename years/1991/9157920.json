 "awd_abstract_narration": "National energy policy must address the greenhouse effect due to                CO2 and the continuing threat to world peace caused partly by                   dependence on foreign oil.  Effective use of environmentally benign             alternate fuels should be on the national agenda.  This PYI Award               will enable Professor Gore and his group to contribute more                     effectively to the efforts now underway to reconcile energy needs,              environmental safety and world peace.                                                                                                                           In the first two years of the PYI award, Professor Gore will                    concentrate on exploring the advantages of nonpremixed combustion               in porous ceramic matrices, recirculating ceramic fibers and                    particles.  Porosity, fiber thickness and strength requirements                 will be defined and communicated to material scientists.  In the                third and the fourth year, experimental and theoretical research                concerning the basic flame structure and radiative transfer with                directional scattering in a participating reacting medium will be               undertaken.  In the final year of the award, optimum fiber loading              for preventing flame quenching and excessive radiation blockage in              different furnace configurations will be studied.  Proposals for                matching support and transfer of technology to practical scales                 will be developed throughout the grant period.  The experimental                research approach will involve optical measurements of heat                     transfer and combustion properties using infrared imaging and                   multidirectional scattering spectroscopy.  Theoretical approach                 will involve transient solutions of reacting flow and radiation                 properties.  In addition to the development of an environmentally               attractive strategic technology, the research is expected to result             in much needed property data for high temperature ceramics and                  advance the understanding in two relatively unexplored areas:  (1)              highly nonadiabatic combustion, (2) radiative transport in                      participating media with directional scattering.",
