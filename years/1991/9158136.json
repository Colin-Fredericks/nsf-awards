 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this effort is to pursue basic and                  applied research in the area of ergonomics.  Specific objectives                include (1) advancing theory for developing instruments and                     analytical methods for measuring and assessing exposure to physical             stress in repetitive manual work, (2) investigating performance                 deficits associated with exposure to these stresses, and (3)                    enhancing performance and preventing injuries by establishing                   exposure and job design guidelines based on these measurements.                      Physical stress in the workplace has been recognized as an                 underlying cause of decreased productivity, reduced work quality,               operator discomfort, worker dissatisfaction, and increased                      incidence of injuries.  Disabilities resulting from excessive                   exposure to these stresses incur significant costs to industry in               the form of medical bills, worker's compensation, reduced                       productivity, lost time, and human suffering.  The ultimate goal                of this research is the development of effective quantitative                   guidelines for enhancing manual performance and protecting workers              from harmful exposure to physical stress.",
