 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inter American University of Puerto Rico will carry                        out a project to improve the science knowledge and                              pedagogical skills of preservice elementary teachers.  The                      project provides eight weeks of summer workshops each year,                     four in the biological/health sciences and four in the                          physical and earth sciences.  The workshops are limited to                      recent graduates of the IAU teacher preparation program who                     have secured teaching positions for the fall, and will take                     place during the summer between graduation and the first                        year of teaching.  Up to sixty teachers per year over a                         period of three years will participate in these workshops,                      for a total of approximately 180 teachers served.  Class                        visitations and follow-up support will take place during                        the teachers' first year in the classroom.  The workshops                       address a critical, often-neglected area of teacher                             preparation, that of induction of the new teacher into the                      teaching profession.  Since these workshops are                                 strategically scheduled to be taken during the summer                           before the teacher enters the classroom, these experiences                      will be freshest in the minds of the teachers as they begin                     teaching.  The project will have a strong influence in                          shaping these new teachers' attitudes, habits, and practice                     in elementary science teaching which should continue                            throughout their careers.  The University has pledged to                        institutionalize successful project activities and will use                     the workshops as a basis for upgrading the science                              preparation of all elementary teachers.  The University's                       cost-sharing is 16% of the amount contributed by NSF.",
