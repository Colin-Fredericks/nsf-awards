The investigator, a cultural                  anthropologist from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, will               conduct pilot research on demographic processes in the Greek                    Island of Chios.  The basic problem is to understand variations                 in population growth, as most areas of the developed world have                 dropped from high to low growth.  This island represents a good                 natural laboratory for this research because there are several                  immigrant groups with different social and economic histories.                  Methods will include analysis of birth and death records and in-                depth interviews with household members on their family plans as                well as surveys of economic and agricultural activities.  The                   purpose of the grant is to help young female investigators                      establish their research projects so that they can write                        competitive major research grants.",
