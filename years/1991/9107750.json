 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of past climate is necessary to quantify the                     natural variability in the climate system.  This is the goal of                 the interdisciplinary research group COHMAP (Cooperative Holocene               Mapping Project).  COHMAP has produced some of the best                         reconstructions in the field of paleoclimatology.  The focus of                 the PI's research has been the Holocene: that interval of time                  since the last full glaciation about 20,000 years ago.  COHMAP's                approach has combined rigorous reconstructions of paleoclimate                  indicators with sophisticated numerical simulations of past                     climate.  In this manner they have been able to place strong                    constraints on the range of past climate and provide                            physically-based mechanisms for the changes observed.  In this                  renewal proposal, COHMAP suggests several new goals for their                   research program, including producing a new set of boundary                     conditions for the glacial earth which incorporate the new                      chronology of the deglaciation and new estimates of ice sheet                   volume and areal extent.  This new research is important because                it will provide fundamental insight into the nature of climate                  during the last 20,000 years and provide an excellent test of the               sensitivity and accuracy of General Circulation Models.  In                     addition, COHMAP's research will help to identify regions with                  insufficient information or model/data contradictions.  In this                 manner, COHMAP research will prove most useful to a wide variety                of researchers in paleoclimatology.",
