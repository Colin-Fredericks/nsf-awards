 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues research on the dynamic behavior of model                economies with complementarities.  The key to these models is                   that the \"activity\" of one agent is an increasing function of the               aggregate level of activity in the economy.  For example, in such               models production by individual firms or search for jobs by the                 unemployed for jobs depends on the overall level of economic                    activity.  These models have been able to provide insights into a               variety of phenomena important to understanding business cycles,                growth and financial interactions.  The multiplicity of                         equilibria that arise in these models creates the possibility of                coordination failures in that the economy can become \"stuck\" at                 an inferior equilibrium.  No single agent, acting alone, can move               the economy to a preferred equilibrium outcome.  This is                        consistent with observed, prolonged periods of low activity, such               as the Great Depression, where it appears that the economy                      shifted to an alternative low activity equilibrium.                                                                                                             This grant permits the investigator to extend past theoretical                  and empirical work to focus on machine replacement and changes in               the seasonal pattern of production in the automobile and related                sectors during the 1920s and 1930s.  The most interesting aspect                of the automobile producers experience during this period was an                effort by the Roosevelt Administration and the Automobile                       Manufacturers Association, in the early 1930s to move the                       shutdown period for retooling from the end of the year to the                   late summer.  This could be an example of a coordination failure.               Automobile producers all synchronized retooling in December, but                retooling earlier in the year would permit greater production                   smoothing.  The project will also study the importance of entry                 and exit over the course of business cycles in imperfectly                      competitive economies.  The last area of work concerns the study                of the aggregate implications of bank runs and the problem of                   designing optimal deposit insurance schemes.",
