 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one-hour documentary film profile of world famous                          mathematician Paul Erdos is being made for eventual broadcast on                the NOVA series.  At age 76, the world's most prolific                          mathematician (1,100 papers and over 200 co-authors) still spends               all of his time moving from country to country, meeting with                    other mathematicians to work on problems.  The film will show how               a prodigious mathematician, with a career of over 50 years, lives               and works, how he interacts with his colleagues, and how the                    international community of mathematicians functions.  It aims to                explore the human side of a discipline in which God, Beauty and                 Numbers are the subjects of daily speculation.                                                                                                                  But what do mathematicians actually do?  Because of his                         peripatetic nature and eternal curiosity, Erdos provides an ideal               window on a field that has often been perceived by the public as                remote and intimidating.  The film will show Erdos and his                      colleagues at work and play.  Interviews and archival materials                 will establish his contributions in combinatorics and in Number                 theory.  Some more accessible problems will be illustrated with                 animation and computer graphics.  The interplay of a warm human                 story with intriguing philosophical speculations and mathematical               problems will show important results are arrived at in                          mathematics.  This is expected to stimulate interest in                         mathematics among television viewers and students.  The film is                 in production and only partial funding is being requested from                  NSF.",
