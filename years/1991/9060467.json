 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although materials science is a key area of technology, there is                little formal treatment of this subject in pre-college curricula.               The project objective is to develop a series of ten stand-alone                 education modules in materials science.  Each unit would be                     prepared at three levels of complexity, suitable for elementary,                middle school and senior high levels.  The program would utilize                interactive physical demonstrations to stimulate scientific                     thinking, relate the subject matter to the students' own                        experience, and show a relationship to other science coursework.                The project would include thirty in-class presentations, with                   teacher review and feedback utilized in modifying course materials.             The final product would be a package of ten complete demonstration              kits, with student support materials and teachers' manuals.                     Teacher training would also be part of the implementation of the                program.                                                                                                                                                        A novel aspect of the project is the provision of a framework for               involvement by private sector volunteers, and establishment of                  private sector contacts as part of the marketing of the modules.                Professional societies would be utilized in setting up these                    relationships.",
