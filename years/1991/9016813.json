This accelerograph (strong ground                                      motion recording) array is referred to as                                       SMART-2, an acronym for Strong Motion Array                                     in Taiwan,                                                                      support for the existing SMART-1                                                accelerograph array at Lotung, Taiwan.  It is                                   also a continuation of a collaboration with                                     the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the                                       Electric Power Research Institute in the U.S.                                   and the Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia                                   Sinica in Taiwan.  In this collaboration, the                                   U.S. institutions were initially the major                                      supporters, but this has progressively                                          changed until now the major support for this                                    project is provided by the Academia Sinica.                                                                                                                     SMART-1 has logged a large number of                                            earthquake strong ground motion records,                                        which have been used extensively by                                             researchers and practitioners in the United                                     States.  SMART-2 is on harder soil, which is                                    more typical of the foundation material on                                      which most major structures are erected; thus                                   it promises to provide strong motion records                                    of even greater value to engineers.  As                                         operation of SMART-1 will continue, it is                                       expected that SMART-1 and SMART-2 will record                                   the same earthquakes, yielding valuable                                         information on the propagation of earthquake                                    motions, especially those motions close to                                      the epicenter.                                                                                                                                                  The Institute of Earth Sciences is                                              responsible for purchasing and installing the                                   digital recorders, preparation of the                                           instrument sites,providing staff for the                                        SMART-2 operations, and for developing the                                      algorithms used tom process the strong motion                                   records.  The NSF is responsible for (1)                                        helping establish the dissemination and basic                                   processing of seismic motions recorded by                                       SMART-2, (2) assisting in the integration of                                    SMART-2 data with that from the smaller scale                                   three-dimensional array operated by utility                                     engineering groups for studies of soil-                                         structure interaction; and (3) the initiation                                   of basic research into the variation of                                         strong ground motion and other ground motion                                    problems treated first at SMART-1 on \"soft\"                                     soil.",
