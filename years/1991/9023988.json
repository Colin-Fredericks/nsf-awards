 "awd_abstract_narration": "With a Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers from the                National Science Foundation, Dr. Mary Hatten will continue to                   study the developmental mechanisms of neuronal-glial interactions               in the central nervous system.  The primary goal of this research               is to elucidate the genetic and molecular genetic regulation of                 neuronal migrations in the developing mammalian brain by                        employing molecular biological methods and mutant mouse models.                 An in vitro model system for mouse cerebellar cells has been                    developed in Dr. Hatten's laboratory to define the cellular and                 molecular mechanisms of migration.  Mutant mice with phenotypic                 defects, expressed by the weaver gene, in glial-guided migration                will be utilized to analyze the genetic regulation of migration.                A novel adhesion ligand, astrotactin, has been identified to                    mediate neuron-glia binding and will be used to describe the                    molecular components of migration.  Functional studies indicate                 that glial-guided neuronal migration utilizes astrotactin rather                than neural cell adhesion molecules.  The expression of this                    ligand will be examined in other brain regions, such as the                     hippocampus, cortex and subcortical regions and astrotactin cDNAs               will be used to clone astrotactin and related genes from cDNA                   libraries of other brain regions.  This work will provide                       information on the sequence of astrotactin, its structure,                      function and homology with known proteins.",
