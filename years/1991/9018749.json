 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flower development remains one of the most interesting and                      complex processes unique to plants, and yet little is known about               the molecular mechanisms involved. Dr. Yanofsky has cloned one of               the genes, Agamous (AG), that plays a key role in determining the               correct pattern of floral organs in Arabidopsis thaliana.                       Mutations in the AG gene result in a \"double flower\" phenotype.                 Similar phenotypes have been described in other plants for as                   much as two thousand years, making this the oldest recognized                   flower abnormality. Dr. Yanofsky's goal over the next three to                  five years is to begin  to dissect the complex regulatory network               that allows the expression of the AG gene to be controlled such                 that expression occurs in a precise spacial and temporal manner.                This will be achieved through a detailed characterization of the                cis acting elements involved in regulation the expression of AG,                and by identifying the sequences within the AG promoter to which                trans acting regulatory factors bind. In addition, since the data               suggest that the Agamous protein is a sequence specific DNA                     binding protein that regulates genes involved in stamen and                     carpel formation, he will directly test the ability of AGamous to               recognize specific DNA sequences. In addition, by manipulating                  the expression of Agamous in transgenic plants, he will directly                test predictions of a model for flower development that has thus                far been based entirely on genetic data.",
