 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to calculate and apply theoretical stellar                   spectra to stars in globular clusters in the Local Group, in                    order to quantify the metallicity calibration and to                            investigate the occurrence of variations in the relative                        abundances of light elements and in the mean stellar age.  The                  work will be based on models and spectra generated from the                     newly expanded line list of Kurucz, which have reproduced both                  flux distributions and individual line strengths of the Sun and                 the cool giant Arcturus in the solar neighborhood.  The first                   stage of the proposed work will be to calculate models and                      spectra for individual cool giants in the Galactic globular                     clusters M4, M71, and 47 Tucanae; the open cluster M67; and the                 Galactic bulge.  The goal is to determine the overall                           metallicity and the abundance ratio of the light elements                       oxygen, magnesium, silicon, calcium, sodium, and aluminum with                  respect to iron, to show to what extent explosive                               nucleosynthesis dominated the element production in various                     environments and epochs.  Following this, theoretical spectra                   will be completed for hotter stars of various metallicities                     near that of the Sun, both with and without light element                       enhancements.  Combinations of these spectra appropriate to                     clusters of different ages will then be compared to the                         observed integrated-light spectra of globular clusters in                       Andromeda to simultaneously estimate the iron and light-element                 abundances and the mean stellar age.                                              The proposed research represents \"state of the art\" work in                   stellar atmospheres and elemental abundances, which could make                  substantial advances in our understanding of the composition                    and evolution of the Galaxy, namely structure of stars and                      history of the evolution of the elements.  The project furthers                 VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for women to                    advance their careers in science or engineering through                         research, and to encourage other women to pursue careers in                     these areas through the investigators' enhanced visibility as                   role models on the host campuses.  In this effort, the proposed                 activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    giving guest lectures on the real-life analyses of stellar                      abundances in a graduate course on stellar atmospheres and                      presenting a seminar on how telescope applications should be                    written.",
