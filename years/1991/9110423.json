 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum fluids and solids have served as important topics of                    research in their own right, and as model systems for understanding             similar physical phenomena exhibited in more complex materials.                 They propose here three series of experiments intended to further               their physical understanding in both these regards.  The first                  series will involve ultrasound studies of the U2D2 phase of solid               3He with the intention of searching for the lattice distortion                  expected to occur upon nuclear spin ordering, and to more fully                 measure the magnetic Gruneisen tensor.  These studies shoud help                answer a number of remaining fundamental questions regarding this               model magnetic system.  The second series will involve a search for             superfluidity in two dimensional sub-monolayer films of 3He                     adsorbed on top of 2-4 monolayer films of superfluid 4He.  If                   successful, this search will provide us with an entirely new BCS                superfluid state, which should shed light on possible 2D                        superconducting states.  Finally, they will investigate the process             by which the B-phase of superfluid 3He is nucleated from the A-                 phase superfluid.  This seemingly simple problem is a particularly              tempting one because we know so much about these phases that they               feel they should be able to fully understand this transition.                   Further, the relevant length scale of the A to B nucleation is so               long that this transition represents a rare opportunity to                      understand in equisite detail inhomogeneous nucleation at a first               order phase transition.",
