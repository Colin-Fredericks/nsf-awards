 "awd_abstract_narration": "The photoprotein aequorin, first isolated by the P.I. in 1962, has              been widely used as a calcium indicator in living cells.  The                   preparations of aequorin used in the past were undefined mixtures               of many isoaequorins.  Recently, three categories of improved forms             of aequorin were prepared in this laboratory:  1)  homogeneous                  isoaequorins isolated from heterogeneous aequorin, 2)  recombinant              aequorin prepared by molecular cloning, and 3) semi-synthetic                   aequorins obtained by replacing the functional group of various                 aequorins with various synthetic analogs.  Semi-synthetic aequorins             have highly advantageous properties in measuring intracellular                  calcium but are not yet fully utilized.  The main objective of this             project is to improve the usability of the new types of aequorin.               Studies planned include:  1) detailed investigation concerning the              calcium triggered luminescence of semi-synthetic aequorins, to                  improve the effective utilization of these aequorins; 2)                        development of a new ratio method of measuring calcium, employing               semi-synthetic aequorins; 3) development of a method to produce                 stabilized preparations of aequorin that are more convenient to                 transport and use.  In addition, sufficient amounts of various                  kinds of aequorin will be produced for distribution to cell                     biologists and physiologists for their use in research.                                                                                                         The results of this research will be a variety of improved                      luminescent probes for measurement of free calcium within living                cells.  These probes, in combination with modern techniques of                  computer assisted light microscope imaging, will ultimately make                it possible to visualize and quantitate the movement of calcium                 into and out of cells and between intracellular compartments during             the response of a cell to a physiological signal.",
