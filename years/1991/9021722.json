 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Oregon              State University for the renovation and repair of Burt Hall which               houses that institution's oceanographic research and research                   training activities.  This building was constructed in 1965 and has             not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $125,000                and $125,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used               to modernize these research and research training facilities.  This             project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure both in terms of health and safety and of the                    quality and quantity of the research and research training that can             be conducted by replacing fume hoods, substandard sinks, and                    laboratory benches, and correcting heating and ventilation                      problems.                                                                                                                                                       This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of                            biological/chemical oceanographic research and for the training of              quality undergraduate and graduate students under conditions freed              from the serious extant environmental hazards.",
