 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several types of photo-responsive polymers have been                       developed over the past 10 years.  However, current limitations                 (such as irreversibility, inadequate physical changes, and high                 expense) have prevented their widespread use.  Bend Research                    proposes to pursue a new class of photo-responsive polymers for                 use in a variety of applications (e.g., optical memory devices,                 absorbants, switches in robotic systems, and coatings for                       pharmaceuticals and other active ingredients).  Given Phase I                   limitations, we will focus this work on controlled-release                      applications.  Our goal is to have these polymers provide 1)                    reversible (on/off) release of the active ingredient; 2)                        pulsatile or sustained delivery; 3) controllable release                        kinetics, independent of the triggering mechanism; and 4)                       efficient use of many different active ingredients at high                      concentrations.                                                                      The proposed technology uses azobenzene compounds as a                     \"switch\" to cause reversible photo-induced changes in the                       polymer.  When exposed to ultraviolet light, functional groups on               an azobenzene compound and an agent compound cause changes in the               physical properties of the polymer.  The polymer properties                     return to their original values when not exposed to ultraviolet                 light.  The proposed use of azobenzene differs from previous                    development efforts in that it does not rely solely on the                      isomerization of the azobenzene compounds as the conformational                 changes in the polymer.",
