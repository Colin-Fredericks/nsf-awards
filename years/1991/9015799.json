 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in field theory                        between Dr. Henrik Aratyn of the University of Illinois at                      Chicago and Dr. A. H. Zimerman of the Sao Paulo State                           University (UNESP) in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Important progress                    in modern field theory is presently being achieved in the                       case of models possessing huge amounts of symmetry.  These                      models are important for understanding two-dimensional                          effective gravity as well as related issues of off-critical                     string theory and conformal field theories.                                                                                                                     New advances in understanding of such models seems to require                   application of geometrical methods to investigate models                        with infinite dimensional symmetry groups.  The method is                       based on a fundamental geometrical idea that the orbits                         associated to the symmetry groups constitute a physically                       relevant phase space.  In this framework the investigators                      will study several models which possess the infinite                            dimensional gauge groups and analyze the consequences of                        these huge degrees of symmetries in the quantum mechanical                      setting.  The main part of the work will be performed during                    mutual visits to the University of Illinois at Chicago and to                   the Instituto de Fisica Teorica-UNESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",
