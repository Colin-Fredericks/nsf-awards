 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Arizona for the renovation and repair of the                      Geology-Mines Building which houses the Departments of Chemical                 Engineering, Hydrology & Water Resources, Mining & Geological                   Engineering, and one-half of the Department of Materials Science                & Engineering.  Included in the research and research training                  activities carried out under the auspices of these departments                  are characterization of pollution generated by coal combustion                  and hazardous waste incineration, surface and subsurface                        hydrology, water quality and trace contaminants, global change,                 geophysical subsurface imaging, rock mechanics, ceramics, and                   electronic materials.  The Geology-Mines Building was constructed               in 1940 and while it has been the object of several remodeling                  projects in the last decade and a half, it has not to date had                  any major renovations.  The ARFMP grant of $400,000 and $440,000                provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize               these research and research training facilities.  This project                  will address the need to improve the current research                           infrastructure by (a) providing adequate casework, fume hoods,                  and the plumbing necessary to convert dry labs into wet labs, (b)               distributing adequate electrical power to all laboratories, and                 (c) adjusting, where necessary, the heating, ventilation, and air               conditioning (HVAC) system in order to balance fume hood draw and               air supplies.  This renovation is expected to increase the                      quantity, quality, and diversity of research output.                                                                                                            This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research in numerous fields which share a common interest in                 research topics associated with environmental matters and for the               training of undergraduate and graduate students.  Students                      trained in these laboratories will gain experience in important                 areas related to national and regional needs.",
