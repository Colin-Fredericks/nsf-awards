 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insects destroy inestimable amount of crops each year.  Spraying                insecticides to control pests has raised serious concerns because               of ancillary effects upon other species, especially humans.                     Pheromones are chemical signals that individuals release into the               external environment that affect the behavior and/or                            physiological states of other individuals.  In insects,                         pheromones are one of the major forms of communication.  Since                  these chemical signals provide a non-invasive method for control                of insect populations, the use of pheromones as an integral part                of integrated pest management programs for many lepidopterous                   pest species is of considerable importance and interest.  One of                the prominent features of this communication in insects is that                 release of the pheromone by females and response by males occurs                during a species-characteristic time.  This temporal synchrony                  assures that males and females will be able to locate one another               at a time when environmental conditions ar most favorable for                   mating.  Drs. Linn and Roelofs' research program is aimed at                    understanding the mechanisms by which these chemical signals are                used by insects.  In this project, they will determine how male                 insects can tell time so that they are responsive to the chemical               signals when the females are releasing it.  They will focus on                  the biogenic amines octopamine, serotonin and melatonin.                        Octopamine and serotonin were selected because their previous                   work indicates that these two amines affect both the timing and                 the sensitivity of males to pheromones.  Melatonin is an                        excellent candidate given the significant role of this hormone in               the regulation of circadian-regulated activates in vertebrates,                 including humans.  Drs Linn and Roelofs will determine the                      relationship between these biogenic amines, behavior and the                    neural regions associated circadian activity.  The results from                 these basic biological studies provide fundamental information                  about invertebrate and vertebrate neurobiology.  Moreover, their                research will aid in the continuing development of pheromone                    attractants for practical agricultural use.",
