 "awd_abstract_narration": "The laboratory will use improved methods for comparing genes                    from living specimens and also ancient remains in order to build                evolutionary trees and suggest time scales for organizing                       knowledge of biological diversity within and among animal                       species, including humans.  Specifically, this project will                     determine the sequence of bases present in pieces of genes from                 the mitochondria of about 600 individuals and 110 species.                      Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternally inherited and evolves 5                 to 10 times as fast as nuclear DNA.  Because different parts of                 the mtDNA molecule evolves at different rates, mtDNA has proven                 useful for studying a broad range of evolution relationships,                   from ones as close as among humans to ones as distant as between                fishes and humans.  Comparison of the sequences will also permit                testing ideas about what determines the rate of molecular                       evolution in such diverse animals as mammals, bird, insects, sea                urchins, and worms.                                                                                                                                             The genealogical framework to be provided for human mtDNA is                    likely to give new insights into human evolution and genetic                    diversity.  In particular, these studies are expected to augment                knowledge of the rime and place of human origin and enable the                  prehistoric processes of migration and population expansion                     across the Old World into Oceania and the New World to be                       examined in new ways.                                                                                                                                           The technique for obtaining each DNA sequence employs the                       polymerase chain reaction.  This method starts with the DNA in a                tiny amount of tissue and makes up to a million copies of a                     specific segment of this DNA, which can then be sequenced                       directly.  Because the method avoids the tedious steps of cloning               and searching for the desired clone among thousands of millions                 of others, obtaining DNA sequences of hundreds of individuals                   (humans and animals) can be done after collection of a drop of                  blood or a few hairs.  In addition, this technique makes the                    world's storehouse of museum specimens, as well as other ancient                remains, accessible to molecular genetic analysis.  This project                will seek to improve further the methods of gathering DNA                       sequences, particularly with respect to retrieving sequences from               museum specimens and ancient remains.",
