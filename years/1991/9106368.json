 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to develop a model for cooperative work in multi-user           rule-based development environments (RBDEs).  RBDEs forma class of              environments that assist developers in carrying out the development             process.  RBDEs are built on object management systems that abstract            project components as objects, representing both product and process.           They model the development process in terms of planning system-style            rules that act on these objects.  Each rule encapsulates an activity            by specifying the condition that must be satisfied to initiate the              activity and the effects of completing the activity.  RBDEs maintain            object base consistency and automatically carry out some development            activities through forward and backward chaining among the rules.                                                                                               Most existing RBDEs are single-user; those that support multiple                users isolate the users, preventing cooperation.  The goal of this              project is to scale up RBDEs to assist teams of developers cooperating          on large-scale projects.  This cooperation involves: (1) concurrency            control; (2) multiple views; (3) evolution; and (4) distribution.               These four problems will be solved in the context of the MARVEL RBDE.           A single-user version of MARVEL has been completed, and licensed to 11          external sites.  Scaling up MARVEL involves solving the four                    theoretical problems in addition to engineering the MARVEL                      architecture.",
