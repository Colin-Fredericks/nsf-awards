 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with research in commutative                     algebra.  The principal investigator will investigate the structure             of projective modules and the efficient generation of ideals and                modules over affine algebras.  The goal is to study these problems              by attaching suitable invariants to projective modules and ideals.              These invariants arise from the geometry of the affine variety                  attached to the ring.  A prominent role is played by the Chow                   groups of the affine varieties and the Chern classes of projective              modules.                                                                             This research is in the general area of algebraic geometry.                Algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects arising from               the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial equations.  This is one              of the oldest and currently one of the most active branches of                  mathematics.  It has widespread applications in mathematics,                    computer science and physics.",
