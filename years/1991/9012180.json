 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research by Dr. Gaffey are to improve our                     understanding of inner Solar System planetesimals by investigating:             (a) the evolutionary history of the inner belt asteroids; (b) the               nature of the early post-accretionary heating event which effected              these bodies as well as the meteorite parent bodies; (c) the                    collisional evolution of the inner belt; (d) the nature of magmatic             differentiation in small planetary objects; and (e) the nature of               the planetesimal population in the early inner Solar System which               accreted to form the large terrestrial planets.                                                                                                                 The asteroids and the meteorites are the sole inner Solar System                remnants of the period during and just after the formation of the               Solar System.  Asteroids provide a \"map\" of the conditions and                  processes in the early inner Solar System while the meteorites                  provide a \"calendar\" of the events occurring during this period.                Earth-based telescopic observations can be used to determine the                surface mineralogies of these minor planets.  The mineralogical                 composition records the conditions of formation of that asteroid                including its thermal evolution, metamorphism or magmatic                       differentiation, and collisional history.  Dr. Gaffey will derive               histories of individual asteroids to investigate the compositional              variations of the original solar nebula, the pattern of thermal and             collisional processes within the asteroid belt, the early evolution             of the Sun, and the nature of the early Earth which accreted from               a similar population of planetesimals.",
