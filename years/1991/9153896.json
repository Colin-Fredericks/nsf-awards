 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Museum will develop an interactive traveling exhibition                     entitled \"Our Weakening Web:  The Study of Extinction\" that                     will explore the process of extinction and examine the                          current role humanity is playing in that process.  Is                           humanity accelerating the rate of extinction by modifying                       the global environment?  The goals of the exhibit are 1)                        that visitors discover that extinction is a natural process,                    2) that visitors explore the many ways humanity is modifying                    the world,s environment, and 3) that visitors understand how                    their actions are related to the world's environmental                          problems and how they can make changes in their lifestyles to                   help protect the environment.                                                   Three size versions (8000 sq. ft., 4000 sq. ft., and 1800                       sq. ft.) of the exhibit will be created in order to maximize                    the number of museums that are able to accommodate the                          exhibit.  After its opening in Cincinnati in 1994, it will                      travel to approximately twenty-eight museums during the next                    three to four years.  Each venue will have the exhibit for                      about four months.  Complementary activities will be                            developed and manuals describing these as well as sample                        materials will accompany each exhibit.  These activities                        will include a teacher's guide, local resource guide, on-                       floor demonstrations, short theater presentations, and an                       adult lecture series.  Sample press kits and copies of all                      promotional materials will be included in the exhibit                           package as well.//",
