 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance of the mammalian brain is dependent on a                        continuous supply of oxygen and glucose.  When brain cells are                  deprived of these nutritive substances present in blood, neuronal               function and viability are endangered.  Little is known regarding               the mechanisms that operate during such ischemic insult or the                  factors that favor recovery.  It is recognized however, that                    ischemic brain cells rapidly synthesize and release unsaturated                 fatty acids and platelet activating factor (PAF), both of which                 act to release calcium from its intracellular site of storage                   known as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  Dr. Brostom has                       provided evidence that calcium mobilization from the ER provokes                rapid shutdown of the synthesis of all cellular proteins.  Upon                 continued incubation, recovery of protein synthesis is observed                 immediately when preceded by an increase in a glucose-related                   protein, GRP78, a resident of the ER.  GRP78 is hypothesized to                 function in protein processing, the last stage of protein                       synthesis.  This research will investigate the importance of this               protein in the functioning of neurons with depleted calcium                     stores.  Neuronal cells in culture will constitute the primary                  model system.  Gene expression for GRP78 will be modulated to                   prove that an increase in this ER protein is required for the                   recovery phase.  Efforts will be made to determine the importance               of GRP78 content in the processing of proteins by neurons with                  inadequate ER calcium.  Experiments using free fatty acids and                  PAF will be performed to test for the capacity of influencing                   protein synthesis, protein processing and GRP78 content under                   conditions that prevail during brain ischemia.  Results from this               study will provide insight on the role of GRP78 during the                      regulation of protein synthesis in neuronal ischemia.",
