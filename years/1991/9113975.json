 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this US-Hungary Project                                Development Visit by Dr. Susan Glenn of the University                          of Oklahoma is to support development of a proposal to                          study succession and restoration ecology.  The US                               researcher proposes to visit Hungary 1) to review and to                        identify study sites in Hungary; 2) to become more                              familiar with research being conducted by Hungarian                             scientists; 3) to collaborate in designing experiments;                         4) to better acquaint the Hungarian scientists with                             western-style proposals; and 5) to visit the Institute                          of Ecology and Botany.  The researchers will plan the                           investigation of the effects of small manipulations on                          successional pathways.  The researchers plan to set up a                        series of parallel experiments in restoration in                                Oklahoma, Kansas and Hungary and to analyze successional                        and non-successional community dynamics on Konza                                Prairie.  The results of such research may aid in                               devising methods to increase the rate of succession and                         to direct the successional pathway.                                                                                                                             This project in the field of ecology fulfills the                               program objective of facilitating scientific contact for                        the purpose of advancing scientific knowledge by                                enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern                       Europe to combine complementary talents in areas of                             strong mutual interest and competence.",
