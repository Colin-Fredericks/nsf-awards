 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of the synthesis of a number of strained molecules,                   termed \"fenestranes and/or fenestrenes\" in this investigation                   will improve the understanding of the bonding character in such                 compounds.  The synthesis and study of the 12 pi annulene                       (staurane-1,3,5,7,9,11-hexaene) and the 14 pi-\u01315.5.6.6.!                        fenestrane heptaene are important in terms of the bonding                       character of carbon.  In the approach  toward \"planarization\"                   of tetrahedral carbon, the targets have been chosen to provide                  a gradual increase in bond angle deformation/strain energy for                  purposes of comparision.  Initial research will focus on the                    synthesis of the \u01315.5.5.5!fenestranes, (tccc) and (tctc), as                    well as \u01315.5.6.6!fenestrenes.  Knowledge gained from synthesis                  of the above molecules will then be employed for the study of                   the more reactive \u01315.5.5.5!fenestrenes.  In addition,                           investigation of the synthesis of fenestrane annulenes will                     help to determine if Huckel pi-delocalization plays a role in                   the stability of such polyquinene annulenes; these annulenes                    are primarily composed of fused five-membered rings.                            Calculations at various levels of sophistication for a variety                  of these fenestranes have provided accurate bond lengths and                    bond angles where comparison with X-ray structures is possible,                 there are no experimental thermochemical data in strained                       systems for evaluation of the accuracy of the computational                     methods.  Studies of the chemistry/reactivity of the target                     molecules will provide much needed insight into the nature of                   the carbon chemical bond in organic molecules in general, and                   in particular with respect to carbon atoms where strain and                     angle deformation may effect a change in hybridization.                                                                                                         The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the continuation of                 the studies of Dr. James M. Cook.  The research will provide                    greater understanding of the effect of strain upon the carbon                   framework by the construction of molecules which have highly                    distorted structures.  This has the potential to provide deeper                 insight into how chemical reactivity can be usefully                            manipulated.",
