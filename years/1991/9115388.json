 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for workshop on parallel computer                performance, emphasizing software tools.  The workshop, the third in            the series, will be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in early October,             1991.  The workshop organizers recognize a pressing need for a                  continuing and productive exchange of ideas between scientists                  engaged in research on performance measurement of high performance,             parallel computing systems.  Research areas especially concerned with           performance related empirical and analytical knowledge the design of            hardware and software for parallel systems and research explore the             usefulness of such systems for scientific computing.  The workshop,             sponsored by Los Alamos and the University of Illinois at Urbana-               Champaign is designed to bring together experts from academia,                  industry, national laboratories and government agencies to explore              these issues.  The goals of the workshop are to ascertain the current           availability of tools for parallel computer performance evaluation,             to report experiences with existing tools, and to determine future              needs in the areas of performance measurement, analysis, and                    visualization.                                                                                                                                                  Thel expertise of the planned attendees, success of the past                    workshops, and the intrinsic merit and relevance of the topic area              ensures that this workshop will result in valuable interaction and              products.                                                                                    //",
