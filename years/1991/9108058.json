 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many operations in engineering and resource management encounter                optimization problems, that is, mathematical problems of choosing               optimally several factors that affect a productivity index.  These are          problems of considerable computational difficulty that have been                extensively investigated in the last three decades.  This project               focuses on several such problems that have a network structure, and it          relates to a class of recently proposed methods called auction and              relaxation algorithms.  The problems to be addressed range from the             classical assignment, transportation, transshipment, and shortest path          problems to some new types of multiassignment problems.  These                  problems arise very often in practice and their size is often very              large.  Methodological improvements for the solution of these problems          will have significant practical impact.                                                                                                                         The investigation will aim at the understanding of the performance of           existing network algorithms and will develop algorithms with improved           performance based on auction and relation ideas.",
