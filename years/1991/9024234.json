 "awd_abstract_narration": "The surface segregation of polymer chains in melts due to molecular             weight effects has important consequences in determining the                    mechanical resilience of composite materials.  It is thus suggested             that the surface behavior of apparently simple blends such as                   isotopic mixtures are more complicated than thought before.  In the             second case they considered the surface behavior of a binary blend,             in which all segments of one chain interact identically with the                surface, while the end moieties of the second species have                      energetic interactions with the surface that are different from the             central beads.  Their preliminary experiments suggest, in agreement             with theory, that the appropriate tailoring of these end-moieties               will dictate which component will partition to a substrate                      interface.  Experimentally, they propose to conduct more detailed               experiments on these systems primarily through the use of a new                 technique, neutron reflectivity, to obtain a better understanding               of the physics in these interfacial situations.  They have shown                that mean-field lattice calculations cannot enumerate the behavior              of isotopic polymers and therefore propose to conduct off-lattice               Monte Carlo simulations on these systems to delineate their                     behavior.",
