 "awd_abstract_narration": "Job scheduling in a multiprocessing system can be broken down              into two major components; the processor allocation problem which               determines the number of processors that should be allocated to a               particular job, and the processor assignment problem which determines           the physical assignment of the allocated processor to the parallel              tasks in a job.  this research will study these two issues based on             analytical models, simulation and experiments on some existing                  multiprocessing systems.  the research thus involves finding a                  suitable characterization of jobs based on which the processor                  allocation problem can be formulated, identifying the appropriate               performance indices and obtaining the allocation strategies that will           optimize these indices, formulating the processor assignment problem            considering both precedence relations and the communication among               tasks into account, developing heuristic algorithms to generate                 assignment which will minimize the job execution time, and performing           experiments on real multiprocessing systems to determine the                    applicability of the allocation and assignment strategies and to study          their effect on the performance of the multiprocessing system.",
