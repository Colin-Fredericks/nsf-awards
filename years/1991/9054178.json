 "awd_abstract_narration": "A six-day residential workshop on the \"Ecology of the Chesapeake                Bay\" for 24 community college science faculty from the five-state               Chesapeake Bay watershed is being held in Summer 1991 at the                    University of Maryland's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL),                Solomons, Maryland.  The workshop includes two days of lecture, two             days of field activities on CBL's research vessels, and two days                of laboratory work at CBL.  The technical content is being provided             by CBL researchers and focuses on the topics \"Plant Life\"  and                  \"Waterfowl and Vertebrate Fish\".  These topics were selected by                 community college science faculty in the 17 Maryland community                  colleges, in response to a survey administered in spring 1989.                  Field activities expose workshop participants to Chesapeake Bay                 nutrient and toxic budgets and to hydroacoustics technologies.                                                                                                  A significant follow-up activity is a videoconference scheduled for             October 1991 for 400-500 additional persons, including educators                in the biological, physical and social sciences, interested                     teachers, government officials dealing with the environment, and                industrial representatives.  Partial support for this follow-up                 videoconference is from the Chesapeake Bay Trust. //",
