 "awd_abstract_narration": "An international, collaborative project will be undertaken to                   investigate the potential multidisciplinary scientific use of                   undersea telecommunications cables that are being abandoned or                  retired by international telephone companies.  Digital fiber                    optic technology has matured to the point where new fiber optic                 submarine telecommunications cables are replacing older analog                  coaxial types.  The older cables still have decades of useful                   life and they represent an opportunity for scientific re-use as a               tool for real-time, long-term oceanographic and geophysical                     observations on the deep seafloor.                                                                                                                              The study of global scale geophysical processes will increasingly               require improved world-wide long-term monitoring of the oceans                  and underlying Earth.  Having access to data in real-time will                  enhance many of these studies.  Achieving these goals of broad                  spatial coverage, over long time periods using conventional                     instrumentation deployed from ships will be costly.  Effective,                 real-time data telemetry via satellites and other means also has                limitations.  One possible alternative would be to use portions                 of ocean-spanning telecommunications cables scheduled to be                     retired in the next decade.  They could be instrumented with                    sensors capable of monitoring certain geophysical properties.                   The cable could provide a source of reliable power, a means to                  acquire high bandwidth data in real time and provide a way to                   control remote instrumentation.                                                                                                                                 The project deals specifically with TCP-1, an AT&T/KDD-owned                    Hawaii-Guam-Japan cable -- a portion of which has been turned                   over to IRIS and the University of Tokyo for use by the                         international academic research community.  Plans are underway in               Japan to initially instrument the Guam-Japan portion with                       seismometers and magnetometers.  Work to be accomplished at the                 U.S.-owned Guam termination site is necessary before significant                engineering efforts and installation of these instruments can be                started.   A small building for housing the electronics that                    power and control the seafloor repeaters will be constructed and                the cable will be re-terminated within this building.  A series                 of small pilot studies will also explore: 1) the feasibility of                 using academic research vessels rather than commercial cable                    ships to handle deep sea cables, 2) conceptual designs for a                    seafloor acoustic modem through which autonomous scientific                     instruments can be connected to a submarine cable, and 3) new,                  low-cost methods to couple data into a seafloor cable in situ.                  U.S. private industry is collaborating in that AT&T is                          transferring ownership of the TCP-1 cable to a consortium of                    academic research institutions, is making space and electrical                  power available at its Guam site, and is keeping the cable                      powered up during a one-year transition period.",
