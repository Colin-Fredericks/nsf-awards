Markusen,                     Center for Urban Policy Research Planning and Policy                            Development, Rutgers University, to pursue with Dr. Sam Ock                     Park, Department of Geography, Seoul National University,                       Korea, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative                      research on regional development theory and practice in the                     United States and Korea.  These collaborators will examine                      the following five approaches to regional development theory                    as practiced in the U.S. and Korea: product/profit cycle                        theories; seedbeds of innovation; new districts; trade-                         induced development; and state-induced development.                                                                                                             Most empirical tests of regional development theories have                      been confined to analysis within a particular country.  In                      the present project, however, theoretical framework will be                     compared and tested against the postwar experience of Korean                    and American regions.  The validity of previous research                        results on a single national experience will be reviewed in                     an attempt to improve the various theories via comparative                      results.  The two collaborators are highly regarded scientists                  who have made significant contributions to the literature                       i/n the field of this project.  This project is relevant to                     the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                    which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                        U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the                            exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                          techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                      benefits.",
