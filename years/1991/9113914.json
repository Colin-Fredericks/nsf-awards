 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the most serious misdeeds in modern societies are committed             not by individuals acting for personal gain, but by members of                  organizations obeying orders from authority.  These acts are                    sometimes called \"crimes of obedience\" and globally seem to be a                consequence of the growth of bureaucracy.  While we surmise that                within organizations there are differing and even changing                      conceptions of responsibility, corporate crime, and what should be              done in the face of such wrongdoing, there is little known about                these attitudes and the conditions that lead to accountability.                                                                                                 The study being undertaken by Hamilton and Sanders directly                     examines such issues.  The research explores how responsibility and             sanctions for wrongdoing in organizations are affected by the                   global dispersal of corporate forms.  Three different cultures,                 U.S., Japanese, and Soviet, representing contrasting legal and                  economic environments (marked capitalism, corporate capitalism, and             socialism) are the sites for assessing the impact of different                  organizational forms on individual behavior.  Based on a survey                 design that systematically varies vignettes according to key                    characteristics of organizational structure, the study examines                 perceptions of individual and corporate responsibility as separate              matters, yet within the context of three contrasting economic                   systems.  This design allows for the isolation of political,                    economic, and cultural influences and the effects of global changes             in organizations on attributions of responsibility, perceptions of              wrongdoing, and attitudes toward social control.  The research has              considerable potential to yield important knowledge not only about              attribution theories but also about organizational compliance,                  regulation, and social control in a transnational context.",
