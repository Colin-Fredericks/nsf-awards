The projects to be  performed by these students include the design and  implementation of several modules for the analysis of rule-  based systems written in different expert system shells and  the synthesis of real-time rule-based systems with bounded  response time.  The students also gain hands-on experience  in the development of an efficient and fault-tolerant  execution environment for real-time rule-based systems.  Students under this program have access to state-of-theart  computing facilities and to industrial real-time rule-based  systems.  This award recognizes the importance of hands-on  experience in active research for attracting and training  undergraduates, in particular, women and minorities, for  careers in mathematics, science and engineering, and that  too few such experiences are now available at large, urban,  public universities.  ***",
