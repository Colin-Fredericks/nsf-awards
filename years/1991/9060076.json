 "awd_abstract_narration": "AstroPower proposes to develop a large-scale, high-                             throughput liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) reactor for                             the fabrication of multi-layer III-V semiconductor                              devices.  A design goal of 1000 cm2 per hour has been                           established while maintaining the key features of                               LPE: 1) highest material quality of all epitaxial                               growth processes, 2) simplicity and safety (as                                  compared to MOCVD and MBE), and 3) low cost                                     (materials, capital equipment, etc.).                                           Liquid phase epitaxy has been used in the                                       manufacturing of laser and light emitting diodes using                          quaternary (InGaAsP/InP) and ternary (A1GaAs)                                   compounds.  The limitations as a production tool                                have been due to low throughput.  The design goal                               for this program represents a 30x increase over other                           large-scale LPE systems and a 3x increase over                                  MOCVD reactors.                                                                 LPE has not been the beneficiary of revolutionary                               new ideas because of the mistaken belief that it is                             \"old technology\".  Nonetheless, LPE material is used                            as the quality standard in materials comparison with                            other techniques such as MOCVD and MBE.  This                                   program will result in state-of-the-art LPE reactors                            which will have superior throughput, material quality,                          and safety compared to any other growth techniques.",
