 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific advance in genetics and its applications in genetic                  forecasting produce multiple issues of public policy; salient                   among these issues are prenatal testing and the use of genetic                  information in the workplace.  An understanding of relevant                     public attitudes and values and their formation can be valuable                 to policy people, scholars addressing the social impacts of                     genetic technologies, and those concerned with education.  This                 research, coupled with NSF-supported research recently completed                by the investigator, will provide a baseline \"snapshot\" of public               attitudes and values.  The investigator providently began her                   research early, before there was much media attention, so that                  initial awareness could be studied.  In this project, the                       investigator will extend the monitoring and analyze the data from               this and the earlier project.  By adding questions to the General               Social Survey, she will obtain additional data on attitudes to                  genetic forecasting that are embedded with other attitudes.  This               is a very economical strategy for enhancing our understanding.                  This project also prepares the way for future measurement of                    values and attitudes in this area.  Publication of the results in               appropriate journals and presentations at professional meetings                 will provide wide dissemination.                                                                                                                                This proposal is a reasonable request for support to enable a                   highly competent investigator to carry out research which very                  usefully extends our understanding of the social implications of                new genetic technologies.  The institutional support is very                    good; the projected research is well planned to provide the                     baseline picture that is needed.  Dissemination will assure its                 research appropriate audiences.  Support is highly recommended.",
