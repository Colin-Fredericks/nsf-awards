 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Sylvia Broadbent, Ms. Adella Schroth                 will collect data for her doctoral thesis.  Her research will                   focus on a tool type known as the \"Pinto Point\" which occurs                    widely in prehistoric sites in the Great Basin region of the                    United States.  The Pinto Point was originally defined on the                   basis of excavations at the Stahl and Pinto Basin sites, both                   located in Eastern California.  However, at neither site are                    absolute dates available. Ms Schroth will conduct further                       research at both and undertake limited excavations.  The data                   recovered should clarify the stratigraphy and also provide                      samples of radiocarbon dating.  In addition to analysis of the                  lithics recovered at Stahl and Pinto Basin, Ms Schroth will study               similar points from other locations.  The result will be a more                 detailed description of this type and better understanding of its               chronological placement.                                                                                                                                        Because the Great Basin has an environment which is both harsh                  and unpredictable, archaeologists have focussed on this area to                 study how humans at a sample technological level of development                 adapt to such difficult conditions.  A major problem such                       researchers face is that most archaeological sites in the region                consist of surface lithics.  For this reason, they are difficult                to date either by conventional methods such as radiocarbon or by                geological context.  In this region, however, tool types -                      especially spear and arrow points change over time and                          archaeologists have used tool typology as a dating technique.                   The Pinto Point. although not as extensively studied as one would               like is often used in this way.                                                                                                                                 The significance of Ms Schroth's research becomes clear in this                 context since successful completion of this research will allow                 more accurate dating of many Great Basin sites.  The work will                  also assist in the training of an extremely promising young                     scientist.",
