 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will analyze                    rigorously several mathematical models of nonlocal phenomena in                 continuum mechanics.  In particular, she will study the question                of the existence of solutions of integral models for heat flow                  with finite wave speeds and with singular memory functions.  This               work is related to parallel work on similar equations arising in                viscoelasticity.  The principal investigator will also study                    nonconvex variational problems with spatially nonlocal terms of                 the type that occur in ferromagnetism and superconductivity, in                 collaboration with colleagues at her institution.                                    Many phenomena in the physical world involve what applied                  mathematicians and scientists call \"nonlocal\" processes.                        An example of a nonlocal process is the response characteristic                 of an elastic material that has been subjected to stretching or                 some other deformation.  The behavior of the material depends on                both the past deformations (a nonlocal effect) and the                          deformation you are applying now (a local effect).  As an                       illustration, pick up your telephone.  The cord will deform in                  some way.  All of those twists and turns in the cord are the                    result of all the past twisting it has received, along with the                 twist you are applying now.  In this project the principal                      investigator will study rigorously mathematical models of                       nonlocal processes of the type that occur in heat flow,                         ferromagnetism and superconductivity.",
