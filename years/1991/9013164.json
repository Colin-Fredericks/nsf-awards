 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marine Science Center of Northeastern University is the                only marine station with year-round research and teaching                       facilities, as well as resident faculty and staff, located on the               coast of New England north of Cape Cod.  It is also the only such               marine laboratory within an hour's drive of most universities in                the greater Boston area.  The location, well north of Boston                    Harbor, provides high quality seawater and excellent intertidal                 and subtidal habitats for field study and organism collection.                  Funded research at the Marine Science Center encompasses a                      variety of projects in marine ecology, behavior, neurobiology,                  structural biology, biochemistry and molecular biology.                                                                                                              At present, development of new projects and addition of new                resident and visiting investigators are severely limited by                     available research space.  This award will increase research                    space by providing partial funding for a 6000 square foot                       addition to the present laboratory building and two pieces of                   badly needed equipment.  The expansion will provide space                       critically needed for funded projects by resident faculty, other                investigators from Northeastern University, and visiting                        researchers from other academic institutions in the Boston area,                other parts of the U.S. and overseas.",
