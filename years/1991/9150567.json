 "awd_abstract_narration": "A module for the introductory course in thermodynamics is to be                 developed which is to be sufficiently flexible to match the                     learning styles of most engineering students. The combined                      expertise of subject matter experts and teaching psychology                     experts are used to define the boundaries and content of the                    module and the order and method of presentation of material.                    Technologies appealing to the visual senses, including use of                   computer controlled interactive displays of full motion graphic                 images are exploited.  Performance of students is to be                         compared with that of students exposed to the standard lecture                  format, and the results will be correlated.  Results will be                    disseminated by sending a paper submitted for publication                       outlining the results of the study and a videotape of a sample                  lecture to all the mechanical engineering departments in the                    United States.  It is expected that this rapid dissemination of                 results will result in the incorporation of some or all of this                 module into thermodynamics courses taught by many engineering                   schools. In addition, it is hoped that the results of this                      study will encourage professors to utilize the principles                       developed in this research to develop courses in other areas                    such as dynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer.",
