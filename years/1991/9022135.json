Such                     catalysts are commonly used in the petroleum and petrochemical                  industries, but are not well understood.  By studying the                       details of the surface chemistry of the catalysts,                              understanding leading to optimization of catalytic efficiency                   and specificity will be obtained.  In turn, optimization of                     industrial processing with such catalysts may be anticipated.                                                                                                   %%%                                                                                                                                                             This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                          Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will employ                        Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) to                           characterize the surface oxidation state of alumina-supported                   chromium catalysts, and then correlate oxidation state with                     reactivity.  Means of easily depositing well-defined thin                       layers of known oxidation state will also be pursued.  By                       correlating catalytic activity with surface structure and                       oxidation state, control of catalytic activity will be sought.                  Raman spectroscopy and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure                          measurements will also be employed.",
