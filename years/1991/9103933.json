 "awd_abstract_narration": "The matrix generalization of the Euler product has been                    introduced in previous work, and it has been shown that                         the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the convergence question                for related products of Moebius transformations.  The present                   project is an estimation theory of such products which would                    be sufficient to answer the question posed by Riemann.  In order                to accomplish this it is proposed to construct disks that are                   mapped into each other by successive Moebius transformations of                 the matrix product.                                                                   The solution of the Riemann Hypothesis is indeed the Holy                 Grail of analysis, and the principal investigator is by most                    accounts the most capable person in the world to attempt                        a solution.  Even if a complete resolution does not result from                 this work the results that are obtained will be of tremendous                   value.",
