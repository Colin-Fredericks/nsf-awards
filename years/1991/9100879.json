 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Biology Department of Furman                   University to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates               SITE.  With this support the department will recruit talented                   women and minority students, rising juniors studying biology at                 neighboring institutions in South Carolina, and extend to them                  the benefits of this NSF-REU program.  Student groups of two or                 three will work closely with each faculty member in full-time                   summer laboratory research.  The student-faculty research                       projects span many of the sub-curricula of the department,                      including gene expression studies in seed development,                          immunocytological studies on phytochrome activity in plant                      development, isoenzyme studies in plants, ultraviolet absorbing                 and fluorescing molecules in insects, isolation of active                       compounds in plant defense mechanisms,                                          community ecology, and neurobiology.  In the selection process                  faculty mentors will be matched with appropriate student co-                    workers.  Student participants will submit a formal written                     summary of their summer's accomplishments.  A regular schedule of               special scientific, social, and athletic events will round out                  the program and provide an added mechanism for developing esprit                de corps among the diverse group of participants.",
