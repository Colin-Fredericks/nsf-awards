 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research by Dr. Jagannadham Kasichainula and                co-workers at North Carolina State University which deals with                  laser processing and characterization of diamond and boron nitride              films, and related semiconductor and superconductor structures.                 Diamond thin films have been synthesized using plasma-assisted and              hot filament-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods.                  Laser-assisted HFCVD has been used to remove graphitic phase                    codeposited with diamond by etching with pulsed laser irradiation.              Single chamber in situ processing techniques have also been                     developed with which multiple layers can be deposited sequentially              via laser ablation.  These methods will now be applied to diamond               deposition on such surfaces as SiC and YBa2Cu3O7 high-Tc                        superconducting thin films, and to formation of laser-assisted                  ohmic contacts on diamond films.  These films will be                           characterized by ultrahigh resolution and analytical transmission               electron microscopy techniques.  To determine atomic structure of               defects and interfaces, a three-step iterative procedure will be                employed, involving atomic structure calculations, image                        simulation, and comparison between simulated and experimental                   images.  Samples will be extensively characterized by optical                   techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, and correlations between                 microstructure, microhardness, and electrical conductivity will                 be measured.                                                                    %%%                                                                             This award is in the Electronic Materials Program of the Division               of Materials Research.  The research supported is directed at                   synthesis and characterization of thin films of diamond, boron                  nitride, and depositions of diamond and boron nitride on semi- and              superconductor surfaces.  This research is of importance because                the unique mechanical, electrical, optical, thermal, and chemical               properties of diamond and its boron nitride relative make them                  ideal materials for applications as diverse as wear-resistant                   coatings and advanced semiconductors.  For polycrystalline films,               key current research issues are those of microstructure control in              such areas as grain size and defects.  Control of these properties              in thin film fabrication is critical to performance.",
