About             150 scientists will be selected from applications on the basis of               expertise, interest, contribution, and balance to provide an                    intellectually stimulating environment.  This meeting will focus                specifically on areas of notable advancement and new conceptual                 development in smooth muscle, including membrane ion channels, Ca2+             pumps, regulation of intracellular calcium, cGMP second messenger               system, regulation and functions of contractile proteins, and                   molecular adaptations of contractile protein expression. We will                provide a special effort to integrate dell and molecular research               with that at the organismic level in these sessions.  These                     combinations are distinct from the first three Smooth Muscle                    conferences, and from any smooth muscle conference that has                     occurred to date.  The meeting will be particularly useful for                  interactions of scientists working in rapidly developing areas, and             will be specifically designed to provide improved dialogue among                those working in highly specialized areas.  Suggestions of new                  experiments and refinement of concepts that are likely to occur                 will importantly advance current knowledge in many areas of smooth              muscle research.//",
