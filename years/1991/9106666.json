 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposed study is to determine the effect of crosses             between individuals belonging to the same species and between                   individuals belonging to two different species on the genetic                   structure and evolution of hybrid populations of irises.  Paternity             analyses (using protein and DNA markers) will be used to discern                patterns of gene exchange in a naturally occurring hybrid                       population and in an I. fulva population where I. hexagona                      individuals have been introduced.  The paternity analysis will also             allow an estimate of the impact of pollen versus seed movement on               the genetic structure of these two populations.  These analyses                 will be used to determine the affect of gene flow on (i) the                    transfer of genes between the two species, (ii) the reproductive                success of individual plants and (iii) the number of plants that                cross with one another in the hybrid populations.  The effects of               natural selection on the survival and reproduction of I. fulva, I.              hexagona and their natural hybrids will be estimated by sowing                  seeds from each of the species and natural hybrids into I.fulva,                I. hexagona and hybrid populations.  Natural selection on the                   different species and hybrids will, thus be measured by recording               germination frequencies, survival to flowering, numbers of flowers              produced and the overall biomass produced.  These measurements will             allow the calculation of the relative fitness of I. fulva, I.                   hexagona and various hybrid classes in different habitat types.                 The estimates of fitness, measurements of dispersal and the                     frequencies of different genetic markers in the hybrid populations              will then be used to test models that predict specific evolutionary             outcomes for hybrid populations.",
