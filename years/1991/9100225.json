 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given a manifold and a Riemannian metric, the investigator                 has defined and intends to study a real-valued linking number of                a pair of cycles generalizing the ordinary integer topological                  linking number.  This pairing is a \"lift\" to the real numbers of                the Abel-Jacobi homomorphism in Algebraic Geometry.  The initial                definition is by differential forms with suitable singularities                 (going back to Gauss in Euclidean 3-space).  The investigator                   studies an exactly analogous complex linking number (originally                 due to Beilinson and Bloch) called the (Archimedean) Height                     Pairing.  This pairing enters into their conjectures relating                   cycles and values of L-functions, but it has been possible to                   calculate it in extremely few cases.  The investigator will                     consider an equivalent construction of the pairings based on the                kernel of the heat operator.  It turns out that this new approach               is well-suited for obtaining concrete formulas in some cases,                   e.g., cycles introduced by B. Gross and C. Schoen involving                     correspondences on a product of three curves.  The investigator                 would like to use this approach in many more cases coming from                  Algebraic and Riemannian Geometry, and also to find relations                   with index theorems and with Quantum Field Theory.                                   Basically, the investigator and his student Bin Wang will                  attempt to make more accessible a previously defined invariant of               Riemannian manifolds.  Their approach will be two-fold.  First,                 they will explore an alternative to the former abstract                         definition, one which is rooted in geometric and physical                       concepts and so may provide more insight.  Second, they will use                this approach to calculate the invariant explicitly in more                     cases, again in the hope of assisting insight into its true                     meaning.",
