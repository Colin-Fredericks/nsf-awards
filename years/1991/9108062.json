 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer science is concerned with building abstract structure in               \"information space\".  There are so many applications in other fields            because these structures are so general and because computer hardware           can realize them.  Computer Scientist study the laws that govern the            processing of information, and they create tools to assist in the               task of building structures, testing and understanding them.  Among             the most powerful tools provided so far are programming languages and           environments.  But the field is now converging on ways to extend these          environments to more powerful and general tools, called problem                 solving environments.  This proposal is about the mathematical basis            for one class of such system.                                                                                                                                   The class of systems studied here is characterized by its relationship          to logic.  It has been discovered that a certain kind of formal logic           provides a basis for both functional programming languages and problem          solving environments.  The idea is that constructive mathematical               proofs can be interpreted as functional programs.  This notion has now          been studied for over a decade and tested in practice.  Results have            encouraged a much deeper study because the programming method                   suggested by these systems seems to be more reliable than ordinary              programming and much more powerful.  It is able to draw on results              from theorem proving, logic programming and rigorous programming                methodology.  This work is concerned with details of how to bring               these elements together.                                                                                                                                        It is possible that the discoveries made in this area will                      significantly change the way people program and the way they solve              certain kinds of precise problems.  The area is currently the focus of          a concerted effort in Britain, France, Sweden, Germany, and the U.S.            Researchers feel that soon systems of the kind being tested will be             widely used beyond the computer science laboratory.  This research              addresses some of the central theoretical problems that must be solved          before that can happen.  In particular it is concerned with certain             ways that these systems can be augmented by their users (reflection)            and with ways that decisions about solving a problem can be postponed           in the process of systematic goal-directed problem-solving (or                  equivalently program development).  The idea for postponement centers           on the use of a special kind of variable called a logic variable.               Results from this investigation will deepen understanding of the                relationship between various uses of logic variables and reflection             in other parts of computer science and logic and find use in the                design of the next generation of problem solving environments.",
