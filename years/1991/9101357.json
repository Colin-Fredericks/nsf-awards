 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Ezra is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and                 Computational Chemistry Program to study energy transfer and                    unimolecular decay using both classical and quantum mechanics,                  ion-neutral molecule collisions by classical trajectory                         methods, and electron correlation in doubly-excited states of                   two-electron atoms by semiclassical methods.  The goals of the                  project are to enhance our understanding of these processes, to                 obtain insight into the relation between intramolecular energy                  flow and unimolecular decay rates, and to develop a novel                       approach to two-electron correlation. The examples to be                        studied are the HOOH molecule, the Li positive ion with                         molecular nitrogen, and the helium atom.                                        %%%                                                                             The transfer of energy within a molecule, leading up to its                     dissociation into fragments, and the low-energy collisions                      between an ion and a neutral molecule, resulting in                             deactivation of the vibrationally-excited ion, will be studied                  by a combination of classical and quantum mechanics. These are                  two of the most fundamental processes by which energy is                        transferred within and between molecules.",
