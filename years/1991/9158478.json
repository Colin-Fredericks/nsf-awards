 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of the theoretical work in distributed computing has assumed one           of two extreme timing models, either completely synchronous or                  completely asynchronous.  The goal of this research is to develop               realistic, partially synchronous models and to determine the                    relationships among them.  This should help to identify precisely what          time behavior is necessary and sufficient for particular properties to          hold.                                                                                                                                                           Complementary work will be to design and analyze distributed                    algorithms that have timing-based correctness conditions or rely on             specific timing behavior.  Another application area is that of                  correctness conditions for systems that support shared objects.  The            goal is to understand and unify the large number of different                   correctness conditions present in the parallel architectures,                   distributed file systems, and operating systems literature, many of             which are timing-based, and to quantify tradeoffs between concurrency           and time performance.",
