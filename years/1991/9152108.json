 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southwestern College (SWC) is a primarily minority, public                      community college.  Through this grant the college is acquiring                 computer-automated laboratory instrumentation that provides                     dynamic, modern laboratory experiences.  Existing physics lab                   equipment dates from the 1960's did not reflect the changed                     technology SWC students encounter in four-year transfer                         institutions and in the work place.The proposed equipment                       allows students to replace current lengthy manual data                          acquisition with automated instrumentation techniques, leaving                  time in the laboratory to explore the physical principles that                  incorporate the measurements.  This is a major shift in                         emphasis from the prior tedious, time-consuming measurement and                 manual computation too often associated with physics.  The                      shift enables students to discover the excitement and joy of                    scientific inquiry and thought, helping to develop critical                     thinking skills.This project is part of the Physics Department                  Five-Year Plan, developed to achieve excellence within the                      Physics Department and thus increase the number of minority                     students who enter professional fields within science and                       engineering.  Equipment acquired includes IBM Computers and                     Interface Component Kits, Linear Motion Instrumentation, and                    Rotational Motion Instrumentation--all items making a complete                  package.  The equipment has direct impact on six of eleven core                 experiments conducted in undergraduate physics courses by 450                   students per year.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds                  from non-federal sources.",
