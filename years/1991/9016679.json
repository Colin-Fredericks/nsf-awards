 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for continuing collaboration                    between scientists from the Department of Physics, Ohio State                   University, lead by Professor Neville W Reay, and scientists                    from Nagoya University, Japan, lead by Professor Kimio Niwa.                    The objectives of this project are to continue to investigate                   areas in theoretical physics of mutual interest, namely                         mixing and CP violation in the decays of B-mesons and the                       gage structure of electro-weak theories beyond the standard                     model.  Collaboration between these two groups has continued                    for the last decade and their past activities have produced                     several important results in charm physics. This award will                     provide support for the completion of the analysis of the                       Fermilab experiment E653.  E653 has very important data on                      the semileptonic decays of charmed particles.  These decays                     are the key to measuring the K-M matrix, one of the most                        fundamental quantities in elementary particle physics.  At                      the present time the existing semileptonic decays data is                       confusing and the E653 data can bear directly on resolving                      these issues.  It is also intended to undertake a hybrid                        emulsion experiment (Fermilab P803) to measure the oscillation                  of Muon-neutrinos into Tau-neutrinos, which could decide                        whether Tau-neutrinos are the long sought after dark                            matter in the universe.  The observation of an effect on P803                   would have a dramatic effect on our understanding of particle                   physics.                                                                                                                                                        The collaboration between these two groups is long-standing                     and successful, and both the US and Japanese groups have                        demonstrated a high competence in the techniques involved.                      The strengths of the US and Japanese participants are                           complementary.  Collection of data by both U.S. and Japanese                    scientists on the project is done at Fermilab, together with                    some of the electronics analysis.  Analysis of emulsions and                    additional electronic analysis is carried out in Japan.  If                     the project is successful, the results of the research will                     be of great scientific interest to the particle physics                         community.",
