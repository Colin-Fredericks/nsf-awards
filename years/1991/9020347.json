Field, Chapin and Mooney will conduct integrated studies of                the responses of California annual grassland to altered resource                balance, focusing on factors controlling the response of the                    ecosystem to elevated CO2.  Their research involves coordinated                 empirical and modeling programs to test a series of hypotheses that             potentially account for the mechanisms and feedbacks governing                  system-level behavior of aboveground and belowground production,                decomposition, and nutrient cycling in response to altered                      resources.  The conceptual model for the system-level effects  of               elevated CO2 is based on two hypotheses concerning the mechanisms               of the system level responses and the loci of the direct effects.               First, they hypothesize that elevated CO2 may generate novel                    resource balance, but the response of plant growth can be                       understood and predicted from responses of other variations in                  resource balance that change the availability of carbon, relative               to other resources.  Second, they hypothesize that system-level                 responses to elevated CO2 are driven primarily through direct                   effects on plants.                                                                                                                                              This research program consists of five components: 1) a study of                the responses of natural ecosystems to elevated CO2 in open top                 chambers.  2) a probe of ecosystem responses to a range of                      modifications, including elevated CO2, altered nutrient and water               availability, and altered species composition, using artificial                 microecosystems in open top chambers.  3) a study of controls on                decomposition and nutrient cycling with laboratory, field and                   microecosystem experiments using plant litter from the other                    experiments as well as isotopic tracers.  4) an exploration of the              resource effects on plant growth, allocation, and tissue chemistry              with a series of greenhouse experiments.  5) a modeling effort to               integrate the experimental results and to link and extend existing              ecosystem, community, and plant models.                                                                                                                         This program has the potential to advance several aspects of our                understanding of system-level responses to global climate change.               First, studies with elevated CO2 in the California annual grassland             will complement CO2 studies in other grasslands, with results from              a system that is unique in terms of low carbon storage and rapid                equilibration.  Second, the small stature of the plants, combined               with the small time constant for system equilibration, will allow               the investigators to explore consequences of a broad range of                   resource availabilities and plant species characteristics.                      Finally, the emphasis on mechanisms of system-level responses,                  integrated through linked models, should make the results of this               study generalizable to other ecosystems.",
