The goal of the project is to                    modernize the course by introducing both lecture topic and                      laboratory experiences pertaining to current innovations and                    motivating factors in the engine industry including modern air                  and fuel induction systems, emission  formation and emission                    testing and requirements.  A modern spark ignition engine test                  facility will be developed for a state-of-the-art engine donated                by industry.  The test facility will be sufficiently automated to               allow the students to focus on the data being taken during the                  testing and not on the control of the engine.  The needed                       equipment includes a dynamometer control system, a PC base data                 acquisition system and some engine instrumentation.  The                        dynamometer control system will hold the engine torque and speed                set points without requiring continual adjustment and provide                   safe, rapid change of set points.  The students will collect                    engine information that is crucial to current designs including                 engine load and speed, combustion chamber pressure profiles, fuel               injection characteristics and exhaust emissions using the high                  speed data acquisition system.  It is anticipated that this                     project will generate more student interest in the area of                      internal combustion engines and produce students that are better                able to serve the needs of industry.",
