 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research supports an economic anthropologist studying share                contracts in an artisanal fishing industry in the Philippines.                  The theoretical issues involve comparing the analysis of share-                 cropping in farming with share-contracting in fishing.  The                     project will collect data on the extent to which share contracts                influence the acquisition of fishing technology; the extent to                  which the egalitarian relations of fishing crews influence the                  shape of share contracts; the factors accounting for crew and                   boat-owner choice of working relationships; the extent to which                 interlocking relationships in credit and marketing influence the                ability of fishermen to negotiate with fish buyers; and the                     discourse between boat owners and crew members over recent                      changes in fishing institutions.  The methods include structured                sample interviews with at least 200 fishermen, and participant                  observation of fishing activities.                                                                                                                              This research is important because artisanal fishing is a vital                 industry in much of the world.  By comparing the socio-economic                 options and strategies of maritime \"peasants\" with agrarian                     peasants, a broader understanding of the way in which work                      process is instituted will be obtained.",
