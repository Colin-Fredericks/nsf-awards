 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will study                      problems in the theory of analytic functions of several complex                 variables.  In particular, he will look at the following                        questions in regard to one-dimensional subvarieties having thin                 ends:  uniqueness, complex tangents, boundary accessibility and                 the relationship of harmonic measure to linear measure.  Further                areas of study include function-theoretic hulls of graphs in                    complex three-space, the boundary behavior of analytic maps, and                the finding of disks in certain polynomial hulls in two-space.                       The theory of functions of several complex variables is a                  difficult subject in which one's intuition derived from the                     theory of functions of a single complex variable is often of                    little help and sometimes even misleading.  The principal                       investigator of this project approaches problems in several                     complex variables from the point of view of what is called                      \"geometric measure theory\".  This theory will enable him to                     continue his important work in the behavior of analytic functions               near boundaries and in the convexity of spaces of analytic                      functions.",
