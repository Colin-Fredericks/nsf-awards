The equipment will be used to                         study several issues in the implementation of real-time                         parallel feedback control strategies.                                           The primary emphasis will be on the application to                              antagonistic control, a new concept for controlling the                         position of an object by means of strings or wires in                           which the tension is actively controlled.  The                                  application not only serves as a useful paradigm for                            elucidating the issues in implementation of parallel                            processing algorithms, but also has the potential of an                         entirely new way of achieving accurate position control.                        Other uses for research equipment will include                                  reconfigurable control and reliable control software.",
