 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical processing systems are typically nonlinear and                         complex.  Control operators in industry tend to rely on their                   own experience and heuristics (or simple common sense) to                       control a complicated process.  Fuzzy logic control is an                       efficient method which can easily incorporate heuristics.                       Fuzzy logic controls are based on fuzzy set theory which is                     designed to allow quantitative measurements of qualitative                      descriptions such as tall, large, small, etc. used frequently                   in human reasoning.  A fuzzy set is a set of numbers having                     membership values between 0 and 1, where 0 signifies weakest                    membership and 1 signifies strong membership.                                   This research project will investigate pseudo-fuzzy logic                       controllers (PFLC) for the control of complex nonlinear                         chemical processes.  PFLC is based on conventional fuzzy logic                  controllers  but it translates heuristics into algebraic                        equations (fuzzy logic sets use decision tables) with tunable                   parameters.  The methodology includes the derivation of                         pseudo-fuzzy logic models which incorporate confluence methods                  for obtaining model structure and modulating function methods                   for system identification.  Heuristics are then translated to                   PFLCs.  System performance can be analyzed using modern                         control methods such as frequency response, Lyapunov or H                       infinity methods.  New rules can be obtained by explicitly                      solving for the control variables from pseudo-fuzzy logic                       models.  To investigate the practical applications of PFLC, an                  experimental study of temperature control of a polymerization                   reactor will also be performed.  The system will be the                         polymerization of polydimethylsiloxanes.",
