 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project, Using a Constructivist Approach to                     Improve the Teaching and Learning of Science, was submitted by                  the University of Vermont and will create collaborating teams of                scientists and learning specialists from the University and                     designated teachers from the participating school districts.                    These teams will provide three-week summer institutes and                       follow-up academic year workshops in the teaching and learning                  of science from a constructivist approach.                                                                                                                      During the three years, forty elementary teachers will be                       selected in teams, which include an administrator, from the                     participating school districts, Colchester, Franklin NW                         (Swanton), Lamoille South (Morrisville/Stowe), Southwest Vt                     Supervisory Union (Bennington), Addison Northeast (Bristol),                    Rutland NE (Brandon), and Barre Town. The teams are committed to                participate in three consecutive summers concentrating on the                   integration of the content (chemistry, physics and geology) and                 current pedagogy (cooperative learning, writing to learn)                       necessary to implement a constructivist active learning approach                to the teaching of science.  Included in the yearly workshops                   will be sessions on adult development to help these teachers                    appreciate the requirements for good inservice delivery.  The                   three summers plus intervening academic year workshops will                     enable these forty teachers to provide their peers with the                     intellectual and technical assistance to teach science                          effectively.                                                                                                                                                    The documented cost-sharing from the districts and UVM is equal                 to 20% of the NSF request, with additional in-kind contributions                indicated.",
