 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Saunders                    will employ an extension of his isotopic perturbation method to                 clarify details of bonding and structure in carbocations. This                  approach, which takes advantage of the cooperative effects of                   multiple specific deuteration, affords information which cannot                 otherwise be obtained via observations made on molecules that                   are substituted with a single isotopic atom. The experimental                   studies will be supplemented by relevant ab initio quantum                      mechanical calculations. This will be done to predict                           carbocation structures and energies and also to predict                         equilibrium isotope effect values that can be compared with the                 corresponding values obtained experimentally. The operation of                  cooperative effects of multiple deuteration results in                          equilibrium isotope effects which are non-linear functions of                   the number of interacting deuterium atoms. Rapid processes,                     which can lead to non-linear isotope effects, include rotation                  around single bonds (which varies dihedral angles between                       carbocation orbitals and neighboring C-H and C-C bonds). The                    angular dependence of the isotope effects provides a highly                     sensitive probe of hyperconjugative distortion of carbocation                   structures.                                                                                                                                                     Dr. Saunders' research project is designed to improve our                       understanding of carbocations, where partial bonding and                        stereospecific interactions of bonds with cationic centers                      (i.e., hyperconjugation) play important roles. In recent years,                 a combination of new developments in experimental methodology                   and improvements in the quality of theoretical calculations has                 provided new insight into structural details and energy                         surfaces for carbocationic rearrangement processes. The present                 project focuses upon experimental extentions of Dr. Saunders'                   \"isotopic perturbation method\" (in which multiple deuteration                   results in cooperative effects that result in equilibrium                       isotope effects which are nonlinear functions of the number of                  deuterium atoms).",
