 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for a grant to establish a                                Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Wireless                    Information Networks at Rutgers University.  Wireless information               services such as cordless telephone and cellular radio are                      technologically in their infancy.  The aim of the research program              at the Center is to overcome bottlenecks that restrict the growth               and enhancement of wireless networking.  The proposed systems                   research projects include; a) multiple access performance                       evaluation, b) object oriented systems integration in wireless                  networks, c) Dynamic spectrum reuse, d) optimization of the                     physical layer, and e) a wireless network testbed.                                   The Program Manager recommends a continuing award of $50,000               each year for the next five years to Rutgers University for                     establishing a Center for Wireless Information Networks.                             Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                   and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review             the progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the               following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                     interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to                  which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                  robust research program is developing.  If the review is                        satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support of the                next period of this continuing grant.",
