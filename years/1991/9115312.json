 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) involves                  preliminary study of the role of plants in weathering by a two-fold             approach; a field study on the island of Hawaii and on Mt. St.                  Helens, and laboratory analyses.  Hawaii offers a unique                        opportunity to study weathering because here there are:  (1) dated              basalts ranging back to more than 4000 years (2) a wide range of                plant life, from lichens and algae to well developed rainforest,                within small regions of constant bedrock lithology and constant                 microclimate and (3) access to the expertise of biologists who are              presently studying plant ecology in the same area.  We plan to                  measure the thickness and mineralogical and chemical composition                of weathering rinds on young flows and to determine the chemical                composition relative rates of weathering in the presence and                    absence of specific biota.                                                           Modeling of the geochemical carbon cycle and its effect on                 atmospheric CO  over Phanerozoic time (Berner, 1990) has revealed               the importance of knowing more about how land plants affect                     chemical weathering.  This includes both the effect of plants on                the rate of uptake of CO  by silicate weathering and the feedback               response of plant-mediated weathering to changes in atmospheric                 CO .",
