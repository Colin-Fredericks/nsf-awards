 "awd_abstract_narration": "Piezoelectric transducers have been exploited for their                         ability to detect minute interfacial mass changes.  The quartz                  crystal microbalance (QCM), comprising a thin wafer of AT-cut                   quartz sandwiched between two metallic excitation electrodes,                   has been used extensively in this regard.  The format of the                    QCM is particularly attractive since AT-cut quartz crystals                     are inexpensive, easily handled and can be configured so that                   one of the excitation electrodes can be used as a working                       electrode in a conventional electrochemical cell.                               Applications of the QCM have been somewhat limited, however,                    by low sensitivity compared to other transducers because of                     the rather low operating frequencies (.10 MHz) of the QCM.                      This program aims to remove this obstacle by investigating the                  use of high frequency (up to 100 MHz), miniature chemically                     milled AT-cut quartz crystals in mass detection, both in vapor                  and liquid media.  The goals this project will be to                            demonstrate (1) the mass sensitivity of these crystals to                       metal deposition and adsorption of gaseous analytes into thin                   active films, (2) the viability and mass sensitivity of these                   devices in liquid media (3) detection of electrochemically                      induced mass changes, (4) the feasibility of various sensor                     configurations using these resonators and (5) the use of these                  crystals as viscosity sensors.",
