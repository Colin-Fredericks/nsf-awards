 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies whether including population structures               can change unstructured models of ecological or epidemiological                 systems that converge to equilibrium states into models that                    undergo damped oscillations.  Mathematically this amounts to                    converting systems of ordinary differential equations into                      nonlinear partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary                conditions and functional terms.  These equations are studied as                evolution equations in an appropriate Banach space.  Specific                   examples are age-structured models of childhood diseases,                       infection-age-structured models of fatal infectious diseases, and               size-structured models of waterflea populations (waterfleas are                 an important laboratory animal).                                                     The dynamics of structured populations and the spread of                   infectious diseases are more complicated than simple models                     predict.  An understanding of the ways oscillations occur in                    mathematical models may well be important to public health, by                  helping to predict the course of epidemic or endemic                            infections.***",
