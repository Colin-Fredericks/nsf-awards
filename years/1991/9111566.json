 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Jeffrey Clark and                 his colleagues will conduct one field season of archaeological                  and geological research on Tutuila Island, American Samoa.                      Archaeological research will focus on the 'Aoa and Leone valleys                and combine survey with excavation of known sites.  The data                    collected will, hopefully, permit the culture history of the                    region to be reconstructed.  Changing lifestyle and settlement                  pattern over time will be studied.  The central goals of the                    geological part of the project will be to determine how relative                sea level changed over time and how landforms were modified by                  human activity.  To accomplish this, ancient shorelines will be                 located and mapped.  Geological cores will be extracted and                     analyzed to determine geomorphological changes.  Palynological                  data will also assist in this process.  The results will be                     generalized to other islands in the Pacific.  Through integration               of both aspects of the research, it should be possible to                       reconstruct the mutual interactions between changing human                      practices and landforms.                                                                                                                                        In recent years, archaeologists have come to realize that Pacific               islands provide a excellent context to study complex human-                     landform interactions.  On the one hand, changes in relative sea                level due to local tectonism altered the landscape available for                human subsistence.  On the other hand, the felling and burning of               forests by local populations also had a major effect because of                 the erosion which resulted.  The response by these groups in many               instances led to the rise of the complex chiefdoms observed by                  early Western explorers.  Archaeologists, however, disagree on                  the specific interaction mechanisms and this study should provide               new insight.                                                                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                basic geological information on changing sea levels which,                      hopefully, can be generalized to other islands in the region.  It               should yield new insight into human-land relationships and shed                 new light on the rise of cultural complexity.  Finally, it will                 help to strengthen the scientific infrastructure at North Dakota                State University.",
