 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study: i) the mechanisms of activation of                     neural tissue by magnetic stimulation; ii) calculate induced                    fields in various volume conductors; iii) simulate on the                       computer the effects of these fields using models of axons and                  neurons; and iv) design a coil capable of focussing the induced                 fields.  This project also intends to test directly the efficacy                of this coil in both the peripheral nervous system and the                      central nervous system (CNS).  This combination of a theoretical                with an experimental approach should generate useful and                        important information about the mechanisms of magnetic                          stimulation and the efficacy of focussing magnetic fields for the               excitation of the nervous system.  This non-invasive method of                  stimulation should provide clinicians with a powerful tool to                   study and map normal brain function as well as diagnose certain                 types of neural diseases provided that the mechanisms of the                    interactions between magnetic fields and neural tissue can be                   understood.",
