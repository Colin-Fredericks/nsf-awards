 "awd_abstract_narration": "With NSF support, Drs. Deino, Drake and Curtis have established a               Berkeley Geochronology Center (BGC) at the Institute of Human                   Origins in Berkeley, California.  The BGC focuses on K-AR                       (potassium - argon) dating and can now produce about 250                        conventional 40K Ar39 dates per year and 3000 single-crystal                    laser microprobe dates which equal about 500 sample dates a year                (several subsamples from the same sample are routinely dated).                  Their microprobe is fully automated and, furthermore, provides                  the ability to date sub-milligram single volcanic crystals.  This               permits discrete age populations in multi-age component samples                 to be identified.  Much of the laboratories research is focused                 on geochronology pertaining to hominid-hominoid (human-great ape)               evolution and associated archaeology and paleontology.                                                                                                          With three years of additional support, the laboratory will work                to improve this dating technique to permit more precise and                     accurate dates.  They will also continue their collaboration with               paleoanthropologists and address a wide range of                                anthropologically significant site specific problems.                                                                                                           The potassium argon technique, which allows absolute ages to be                 derived from volcanic materials has revolutionized the field of                 human origins studies because many important sites in Africa,                   which were previously undatable, contain multiple volcanic                      horizons.  Fossils can only be correctly interpreted if put into                a chronological framework, and many specimens which were                        difficult to use have taken on new importance.                                                                                                                  Dr. Deino and his colleagues have been leaders in the development               and application of this technique.  It is thus important to                     support both their laboratory and the specific research goals                   they are pursuing.",
