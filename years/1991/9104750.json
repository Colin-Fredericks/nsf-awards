 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the further development of a technique              originally developed for the purpose of locating disagreements                  between remotely located large files using a minimum of                         communication.  The technique has been found to be quite effective              for outer code decoding of concatenated codes for error control                 over a noisy channel.  The code rules are rather arbitrary, and yet             correction of almost cases of d-2 or fewer outer code symbol errors             is possible with a decoding complexity which increases no faster                that as the cube of the block length.  Two areas are emphasized in              this project. one area relates to the implications and relative                 advantages of using the new technique in various error control                  coding applications.  The other area relates to the investigation               of applications to various problems of communication, maintenance,              and verification of the identity of replicated remote files in an               efficient manner.",
