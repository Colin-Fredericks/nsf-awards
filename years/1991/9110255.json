 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study randomized algorithms to solve information              storage and retrieval problems.  Specifically, the project will focus           on randomized hashing schemes, which enable the quick retrieval of any          item stored in a table.  In the hashing shcemes considered, a hashing           function is randomly chosen from a small universal class of hashing             functions, and good average performance is guaranteed for arbitrary             data.  Such classes of universal functions provide important progress           in closing the gap between idealized models and the situations that             one is faced with in practice.  Various closed hashing schemes, in              which all items are placed in a table and no pointers are available,            will be investigated.  The techniques developed for analyzing the               interactions which occur in a closed hash table are likely to be                extendible to the analysis of other randomized constructions.  A key            problem that arises in a randomized algorithm is that its performance           depends on the generation of random variables.  Since pseudo-random             variables are used in practice, it is very important to analyze how             independent the generated variables need to be in order to ensure the           predicted performance.  Such analysis provides a measure of how robust          the randomized algorithm is.  Several randomized schemes will be                investigated to determine whether, in exchange for some degradation in          performance and some changes in the algorithm, functions with very              limited independence may be used as well.",
