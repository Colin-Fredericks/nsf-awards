 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the concepts of manufacturability and reliability,                      and the associated data acquisition systems become                              increasingly necessary to the analog design process in                          industry, it becomes correspondingly important to incorporate                   these concepts, as well as the equipment, into the                              undergraduate curriculum.  Under this project equipment is to                   be acquired which will enable the emerging concepts of                          tolerance analysis and statistical design of circuits and                       systems to  be added to the analog design portion of the                        undergraduate electrical (EE)  and computer (CpE) engineering                   curricula.  This technology is often labeled \"Designing for                     Manufacturability,\" and refers to yield, reliability, and                       performance of circuits and systems.  These curricular topics                   will be taught to all EE and CpE majors through                                 laboratory experiments in the sophomore and junior years.                            This project is significant because it focuses on the                      early introduction of the basic concepts of design for                          manufacturability at the undergraduate level in analog design                   courses.",
