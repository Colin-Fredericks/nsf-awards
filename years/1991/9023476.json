 "awd_abstract_narration": "A prerequisite for the development of contemporary scientific                   research was the development of instrumentation for precision                   measurement to a degree of accuracy which was thought impossible                prior to the 19th century.  In her study, \"The Meaning of                       Precision,\"  Dr. Olesko is examining the objective and subjective               significance of precision instruments when they first really began              to be systematically developed, i.e. in Prussian science and                    scientific culture from the late 1810s to the 1870s.  The 1810's                was the time when the method of least squares was first introduced              into physical investigations;  the 1860s and 1870s was the time                 when the consequences of the first state-supported projects                     requiring precision instruments (weights and measures,                          triangulation, and heating power of fuels) were felt in Prussian                society.  Dr. Olesko is examining selected issues concerning                    precision measurement in science (chiefly physics, but also                     chemistry and to some extent physiology) and in science teaching                (chiefly physics).  She is also exploring the utility of exact                  experiment and precision measurement for the Prussian state.  In                addition, by looking at images, metaphors and rhetoric, she is                  including studies of the symbolic and cultural meaning of                       precision.  Finally, she is including a comparative component--                 primarily by examining American notions of precision during this                period, but also other comparisons are being considered.  This                  study is essential for a proper understanding of the rise of                    contemporary science.",
