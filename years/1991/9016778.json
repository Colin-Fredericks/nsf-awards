 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most basic questions astronomers are asked by the layman             is \"where did the atoms composing the Earth and our bodies\" come                from?\"  Indeed during the last generation astronomers have put a                great deal of work into answering this question by mapping the                  enrichment of interstellar gas by heavy element atoms from stellar              explosions that occur after these atoms are formed from hydrogen                by complex nucleosynthetic reactions in the deep interiors of                   highly evolved stars.  Although earlier work concentrated on                    determining the chemical abundance of the iron group elements,                  recent investigations have shown that the iron-group abundance                  enhancements did not start until comparatively late in the history              of the Galaxy.   Better indicators of enrichment during the early               era (including the first hour after the Big Bang) are provided by               the elements oxygen, carbon, and beryllium.   The oldest stars                  betray this history best, but they are faint and difficult to                   observe.  Moreover, the absorption line leading to abundance                    determinations of beryllium is located in the ultraviolet part of               the spectrum that is inaccessible to Earth-based astronomers except             in high mountain, low-latitude observatories such as Mauna Kea in               Hawaii.  The Principal Investigator (PI) has been active in                     studying chemical evolution studies of old stars in the Galaxy for              years and will extend her investigation to the faint halo stars in              the Galaxy with this three year award.  Recent advances in detector             technology should also permit the PI to obtain not only more                    accurate abundances but also to sample the chemical evolution in                stars that were formed during the original collapse of the Galaxy               from a proto-galactic cloud.  The abundance results for beryllium               may also permit a more constrained model of the Big Bang to be                  developed.",
