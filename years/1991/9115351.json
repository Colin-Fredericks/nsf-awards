 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this Grant for Explaratory Research Armstrong and Nebesny                  will attempt to create a completely new class of materials                      based on superlattices of phthalocyanines deposited by                          molecular beam epitaxy.  They will characterize the initial                     surface chemistries of the materials, answering questions such                  as the way in which the materials nucleate, and the method by                   which they stack.  The optical properties of the materials will                 be explored.  Initial expectations would suggest that the                       materials may be important in fast optical switching - a                        situation that is not achievable completely with existing                       materials.                                                                                                                                                      %%%                                                                             The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                     Chemistry, focuses on the investigation of new superlattice                     materials created by unconventional molecular beam epitaxy.                     The work promises to lead to the preparation of novel                           superlattice materials with important optical properties which                  could lead to new optical switching devices. Because the work                   has high novelty and urgency it is being funded through a Grant                 for Explaratory Research.",
