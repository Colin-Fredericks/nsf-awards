 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equations which describe stimulated Raman                                   scattering in the transient limit are nonlinear and                             integrable.  However, the physical behavior of this                             system after propagating, long distances is quite                               different from other integrable systems such as light                           pulses in optical fibers.  In optical fibers, the light                         pulses break up into a number of solitons and a                                 dispersive wave contribution, while in the transient                            regime of stimulated Raman scattering, the solutions                            tend toward a similarity solution which depends on                              (distance) x (time).  This last result, while inferrable                        from previous numerical results, was only recently                              proved, and many of its consequences remain to be                               elucidated.  The first issue of concern is the limitation                       which second Stokes generation and finite T2 impose                             on possible experimental observation of the self-                               similar solution.  We will investigate this                                     phenomenon.  We will also explore the impact of the                             transient Raman effect on limiting the conversion                               efficiency of Raman frequency downshifters which are                            used in conjunction with Ti:Sapphire lasers.  We will                           also explore the extent to which similar techniques                             can be applied to fiber gratings, two-level systems,                            photorefractive materials, and other systems which                              have either already been shown to exhibit self-                                 similarity or are promising candidates because they                             have long-term memory.  Finally, on the                                         mathematical front, we will collaborate with Tom                                Seidman in studying the stability of these solutions                            and with other mathematicians in obtaining                                      asymptotic formulae for the self-similar case when the                          frequencies are detuned.",
