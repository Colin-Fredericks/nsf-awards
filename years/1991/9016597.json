 "awd_abstract_narration": "Land degradation is occurring wherever land is cultivated and                   often undermines the productive capacity of ecosystems.                         Vegetative cover offers a simple, inexpensive, but under-utilized               technology which can be used to control erosion and prevent soil                degradation.  Its use in agricultural systems has been limited by               human and technical factors.  This project will develop a rapid                 screening system for selection of tropical and temperate species                for use as vegetative covers in harsh environments.  Growth                     chambers will be used to simulate specific environmental                        conditions and characterize boundary conditions of temperature,                 moisture and light for germination and early growth of selected                 species.  Field tests at temperate and tropical field sites will                be used to evaluate growth chambers as prediction tools.  Socio-                cultural analyses will be conducted at a tropical field site to                 enhance adoption and adaption of the technology and improve its                 efficacy in restoring degraded lands.",
