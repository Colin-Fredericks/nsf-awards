 "awd_abstract_narration": "The presence of a learning curve has been documented in                    many industries.  Yet little is known about why learning                        occurs, whether it persists, and how to transfer it.  This                      award empirically investigates the persistence of learning                      within organizations and the transfer of learning across                        organizations.  The role of turnover in learning and its                        persistence are also examined.  The analyses are based on                       records data collected from one firm in the aerospace                           industry producing an advanced jet and from three plants of                     the same firm in the automotive industry producing a light                      truck.  The principal investigator will estimate production                     functions with variables included to assess the importance of                   persistence, transfer and labor turnover in affecting the                       efficiency of the production process.  In addition to testing                   whether learning persists, whether it transfers, and whether                    turnover is related to the rate of learning, the research                       aims to develop a theoretical model of learning in                              organizations that integrates and explains the empirical                        findings.  The research will advance scientific knowledge                       about why learning occurs in organizations and whether it                       persists and transfers.  This information will enable                           organizations to improve their productivity and hence,                          compete more effectively.  The information will also lead to                    improved forecasting.",
