The speech materials selected will be suitable                 for studying vowel reduction and vowel-dependent consonant                      coarticulation.  The phonetic segments to be analyzed will come                 from three operationally defined styles of speech providing                     samples that range from strongly context-dependent (reduced,                    coarticulated) forms to neutral and less context-dependent                      (\"clearly\" spoken) tokens.  The goal is to be able to specify how               the acoustic parameters change across such forms, to evaluate the               perceptual significance of the changes and to propose numerical                 models describing and predicting the observed patterns of                       variation.  Key questions are:  Do speakers change their speech                 when they try to \"speak more clearly\", that is when they adapt to               listener needs?  If so, what acoustic modifications do they                     invoke to disambiguate reduced, coarticulated and perceptually                  similar forms?  What is the nature of the acoustic transforms                   that are communicatively successful?  The project will take steps               towards discovering the systematic structure of intra-speaker                   phonetic variation and should thus produce results relevant to                  attempts to resolve the invariance issue (Perkell & Klatt 1986),                a classical topic for general theories of spoken language and one               of the unresolved problems still facing the design of automatic                 systems for text-to-speech conversion and speech                                recognition/understanding.",
