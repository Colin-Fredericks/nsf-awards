 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program supports a joint project by Dr. Gregory J. Grant of the                 Chemistry Department, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga                    and Dr. William Setzer of the Chemistry Department, University                  of Alabama at Huntsville.  New medium-sized cyclic tridentate                   and macrocyclic hexadentate polythioethers will be prepared and                 used to bind a variety of divalent and trivalent metal ions,                    including Pt(II), Pd(II), Hg(II), Cd(II), Re(III), V(II),                       Cr(II), and divalent lanthanides.  Organometallic compounds of                  Rh will be synthesized and tested as stereospecific                             hydrogenation catalysts.  The compounds are expected to exhibit                 unusual properties due to imposed structural constraints and to                 display differential affinities for metal ions.                                 %%%                                                                             Large cyclic organic molecules containing sulfur can bind to                    metal ions via the sulfur atoms.  When, as in the molecules                     chosen for this study, three or six sulfur atoms are available                  for such bonding, the metal can be trapped inside a large                       organic structure.  Depending on the size of the ring, the                      number and orientation of the sulfur atoms, and the properties                  of a particular metal ion,  metal ions differ in their tendancy                 to remain trapped in these molecules.  This research will                       prepare new cyclic compounds and examine the properties of the                  metal complexes they form.  The project is potentially                          important to developing methods of heavy metal extraction,                      bioinorganic chemistry, and catalysis.",
