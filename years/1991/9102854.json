 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to design, analyze, implement and test              several groups of parallel methods for solving sparse nonlinear                 systems of equations on parallel computers.  The approach is to                 transform sparse nonlinear systems of equations into some special               structures so that the computations can be decomposed for parallel              processing.  The research will concentrate on two  important classes            of naturally structured systems:  1) large-scale block bordered                 systems of nonlinear equations, obtained by permuting general                   nonlinear systems.  It is planned to develop parallel explicit and              implicit methods and iterative methods for solving the block bordered           nonlinear systems of equations, including convergence analysis,                 perturbation methods for singular or nearly singular block bordered             systems, applications of the secant method, and the implementations of          the methods on different types of parallel computers.  The                      investigation will also be extended to different direct and iterative           methods for solving the block triangular nonlinear systems of                   equations including the convergence analysis, applications of quasi-            Newton methods and asynchronous parallel methods for solving this type          of problems.  The method design is motivated by the use of parallel             computers, and the implementation and testing will be on parallel               computers.  The goal is, however, to discover new methods that                  efficiently solve sparse nonlinear systems of equations in structured           approaches on a parallel computer.",
