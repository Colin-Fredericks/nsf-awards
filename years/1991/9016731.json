 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is devoted primarily to atmospheric aerosols.                  Laboratory experiments will probe the conditions under which                    aerosols of ammonium sulfate and ammonium bisulfate can be formed               in the gas phase from ammonia, sulfur trioxide and water vapor.                 The aerosols will be produced by mixing the reacting gases in a                 flow tube.  Particle-size distributions of the resulting aerosols               will be deduced from measurements of ultraviolet light                          scattering.                                                                          Experiments will assess the possibility of chemically                      identifying such aerosols by observing light emitted by them when               they are exposed to laser beams of variable wavelength and                      intensity.  Variations of these experiments will test                           possibilities of separately detecting chemical species adhering                 to the surfaces of the aerosol particles.                                            Similar experiments will be conducted on the formation of                  ammonium nitrate aerosols from ammonia, water vapor, nitric acid                and/or nitrogen dioxide.                                                             The experiments will be useful for better understanding of                 conditions under which these aerosols are formed in both the                    natural and the perturbed atmosphere.  The feasibility of                       measuring the aerosols under field conditions will be explored.                 Experiments aimed at detecting chemical species adhering to the                 aerosol surfaces are designed to reveal any unsuspected surface-                chemical properties of the aerosols, by virtue of which they                    might influence the chemistry of the gas phase.",
