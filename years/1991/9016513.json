 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program supports the continued work of Dr. Clifford Kubiak of                   the Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, on the design                   and synthesis of new compounds which will activate and reduce                   carbon dioxide.  In this project, Kubiak will study ways to                     form carbon-carbon bonds by coupling carbon dioxide molecules.                                                                                                  Binuclear transition metal complexes will be tested as means to                 provide the electrons needed for the coupling reaction.                         Single-bonded Ir, Rh, Ni and Pt complexes will be prepared and                  photolyzed by laser transient absorbance techniques.  The                       photoinduced cleavage of the metal-metal bond will provide two                  electrons for bond formation.  The complexes are designed to                    form radical transients which are \"tuned\" for carbon dioxide                    reduction.  The photogenerated radicals will be characterized                   using an infrared detector supported by this grant.  The                        project is based on past findings that structural changes in                    certain binuclear compounds make them effective in photoinduced                 electron transfer reactions.",
