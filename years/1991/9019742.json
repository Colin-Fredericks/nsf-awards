 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to study populations of African                       American mothers and children in the Hampton Roads area of                      Virginia.  She will attempt to reach a variety of mother-                       child dyads that vary in socioeconomic status, age and                          education.  Mothers who are identified for the study will                       be contacted by the researcher first by letter and then by                      a follow up phone call in which the study will be                               explained in more detail and appointments will be made to                       further explain the experimental procedures.  Mother and                        child interaction will be studied by using videotapes to                        record different responses such as body contact,                                affection, vocalization, positioning etc...  Videotapes to                      maximize the accuracy of observations.  Tapes will be                           observed by trained judges who will be blind to the                             hypotheses and other data collected on the subjects.  The                       investigator proposes to use a sample of 100 mothers with                       infants.  She will use multiple regression analysis using                       the attachment status of the 16 month old infant as the                         criterion, and the other variables as predictors.  The                          effect of age, education and socioeconomic status will be                       determined by analysis of co-variance.",
