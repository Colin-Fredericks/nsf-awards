 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most widely accepted driving mechanisms for regional                        migration of pore fluids in sedimentary basins are sediment                     compaction and topography.  Previous analyses indicate that both                mechanisms have potential difficulties explaining some of the                   above geologic observations unless the fluid flow is spatially or               temporally restricted.  Specifically, heat content of pore fluids               or flow rates or both are not sufficient for compaction driven                  flow to produce migration of warm pore fluids on a regional                     scale.  Topographically-driven flow may produce warm pore fluids                on a regional scale, but would result in depletion of saline                    components of fluids.  We propose to carry out a two year study                 on the following aspects of regional migration of hypersaline                   brines: (1) develop suitable PTX equations of state for                         hypersaline brines under basinal conditions and examine the                     effects of salinity in controlling pore water flow in sedimentary               basins; (2) examine various mechanism for focusing or                           concentrating flow of warm, saline brines, including: episodic                  expulsion of pore fluids, fluid flow along aquifers or faults,                  deflection or focusing of fluid flow by basement or surface                     structures and three-dimensional flow; and (3) apply these                      results to the regional migration of pore fluids in the Colville                Basin, Alaska and the Northern Gulf Coast.  The regional                        migration of hypersaline brines over hundreds of kilometers                     through sedimentary basins has been suggested as a mechanism to                 explain a number of important geologic observations.  These                     include: remagnetizations found in Paleozoic carbonates of North                America, clay mineral diagenesis, inclusions of high pressure,                  high temperature fluids, and distribution of oil, gas and                       Mississippi Valley-type lead-zinc deposits.",
