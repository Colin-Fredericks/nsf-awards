 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1987, Dr. Rosemary G. Gillespie discovered a remarkable                      radiation of spiders in the genus Tetragnatha in the Hawaiian                   islands.  She is currently describing the structure, behavior, and              ecology of each of 50 previously-unknown and 8 known species found              nowhere else on earth.  Although Tetragnatha species are abundant               and widely distributed on earth, the Hawaiian spiders are more                  diverse than those known in the rest of the world combined.  The                ultimate goal of the work proposed here is to explain the                       mechanisms by which this diversity was generated.  Crucial to that              goal is the construction of an accurate pattern of relationships                (phylogeny) of the species.  Recently, the use of DNA sequences to              augment more traditional data used to determine relationships has               already sequenced a segment of DNA from some of these species.  The             work proposed here will expand that data set in order to delineate              the approaches which shall be taken in studying the mechanisms of               explosive diversification in this group.  The results of the final              work should have broad implications in the field of phylogenetics               and systematics at the species level, not only within ecologically-             diversifying species swarms in Hawaii, but in continental habitats              as well.",
