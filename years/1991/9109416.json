 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strain softening is a characteristic displayed in several materials             encountered in civil engineering.  For example, rock, concrete, and             dense soil exhibit the behavior where the tangent modulus decreases             from an initial positive value and becomes negative as strain                   increases.  When softening is involved with a structural component,             however, an internal snap-back instability may occur, with the                  softening branch taking on a positive slope.  Failures of this type             would be catastrophic even in a displacement-controlled setting and             must be prevented.                                                                                                                                              The objective of this research is to develop and apply a theory of              brittleness in order to predict the global behavior of a structure              composed of a strain-softening material.  An elastic-plastic                    constitutive law will be adoptive for the local strain components,              while the softening behavior will be described in terms of                      displacement components through a cohesive-zone model of fracture.              Experiments will be conducted in a closed-loop, servo-hydraulic                 testing system to capture the post-failure regime and to evaluate               the necessary material parameters.  The softening response of                   concrete beams in three-point bending will be studied by varying                the geometry, size, and constraint, while recording the acoustic                emissions from the failure process.  Acoustic emission testing in               proposed as a viable nondestructive technique to detect the onset               of an instability.  This research will provide an analytical                    explanation and present experimental evidence of the snap-through               versus snap-back behavior of strain-softening beams.",
