With the proposal of a new NSF program that will                     develop resources and virtual communities on Internet to                        support the widespread implementation of advanced                               technologies and curricula in science, math and engineering                     education, our lack of understanding of local communication                     infrastructures becomes an urgent concern.  This project                        will examine the technological and pedagogical                                  infrastructures that are required for teachers and students                     to make optimal use of these resources.  The exploratory                        research will investigate1) the major issues schools and                        materials developers will face in implementing programs                         making use of the Internet,2) models that are currently                         available for providing access 3) the current resources,                        capabilities and mechanisms of the Internet and 4) new                          developments and approaches that are most likely to provide                     maximum leverage in obtaining educational advantages from                       Internet resources.",
