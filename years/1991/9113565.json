 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little systems software for distributed memory multicomputers is           portable to other multicomputers; as a result, users must pay as much           attention to the attributes of the hardware they use as to their                research.  Also, researchers working on different multicomputer                 hardware can rarely share applications software.  In this setting, NSF          can take an active role in catalyzing the evolution of multicomputer            systems software.                                                                   During a year starting September 1, 1991, the Ohio Supercomputer            Center will port a portable operating system foundation, named                  Trollius, to multicomputers based on fast, leading microprocessors,             such as the Intel i860 and Transputer.  Multicomputers made by several          vendors will thus run compatible systems software.  Trollius is a non-          proprietary, \"open\" operating system for distributed memory parallel            computers.                                                                           Small groups conducting scientific research are frequently the             end users who will benefit from having Trollius on their computer               systems.  Research areas pursued at current Trollius sites include              computer algorithms development, parallel processing research, and              computational mechanics.  The project will increase the useful                  lifetime of software developed by research projects and will expand             the use and usability of multicomputers in the U.S.",
