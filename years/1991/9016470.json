 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to support the installation, in collaboration                    with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) - and possible                           collaboration with the California Division of Mines and                         Geology (CDMG) - of two deep arrays in the San Francisco                        Bay area, with the objective of measuring ground motions                        and the elevation of ground water pressure during the large                     earthquake that is expected to occur in the San Francisco                       Bay area.  These recordings will provide valuable data for                      seismological, earthquake engineering and earthquake hazard                     mitigation studies: these data do not exist at present.                                                                                                         Surface measurements from the October 17, 1989 Loma                             Prieta, California earthquake showed that the apparent                          amplification of the peak horizontal ground acceleration at                     deep clay sites was higher by 100% or more than would                           have been anticipated; yet no measurements in the soil                          profile showing how amplification progressed between                            bedrock and the ground surface are available.  Nor are data                     of this type available at other locations for strong-motion                     earthquakes.  There is a significant probability (67% in 30                     years) that an earthquake producing greater intensity of                        motion than the Loma Prieta event will occur in the San                         Francisco Bay area; it is thus an excellent location to                         establish a deep accelerometer array to improve prediction                      capabilities.  Sites are being surveyed in the area, and                        several promising locations have been identified.  An                           advisory panel consisting of eminent researchers and                            administrators in earthquake hazard mitigation, from major                      universities in the United States and Canada, and from the                      USGS and CDMG, will provide advice on the general                               requirements for the sites and their instrumentation, as well                   as on the location of instruments to maximize the usefulness                    of the data recovered.  The panel members have expertise                        in earth science, geotechnical engineering, and field data                      measurements.                                                                                                                                                   The damage caused by the Loma Prieta earthquake, as well                        as previous major earthquakes worldwide, point to the need                      to measure two different types of data so as to improve                         earthquake hazard mitigation methods:  The measurement                          during strong earthquake-induced ground shaking of the                          amplification of ground motions in deep clay deposits; and                      the ground motions and the increase in ground water                             pressure in saturated sands during strong earthquakes. These                    measurements could be obtained through two separate field                       arrays, or a combined array at a site which has the                             appropriate combination of saturated sands and deep clay                        deposits.                                                                                                                                                       The establishment of these arrays follows the                                   recommendations of the September 1988 workshop on                               \"Designated Sites for Geotechnical Experimentation in the                       United States\", and the November 1990 workshop on                               \"Dynamic Soil Properties and Site Characterization\".  These                     sites will become designated geotechnical test sites, open to                   all interested researchers.  The sites will be available for                    research into geotechnical phenomena not associated with                        earthquakes, but it is expected that the sites chosen will, in                  general, be more suitable for investigation of the                              earthquake-induced phenomena discussed.",
