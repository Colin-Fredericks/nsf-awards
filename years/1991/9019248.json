 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has several objectives, all related to the function                of D2, one of the photosystem II reaction center proteins in                    thylakoid membranes.  Using site-directed mutagenesis and gene                  replacement in the D2-encoding pbsD1 gene from the cyanobacterium               Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the first objective is to determine the             role of residues near the C-terminus of D2 in the water-splitting               process and in proper folding of D2.  In addition, three-                       dimensional proximities of D2 residues involved in water splitting              will be probed by analysis of spontaneous photoautotrophic mutants              generated from obligate photoheterotrophic site-directed D2 mutants             impaired in water splitting.  Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis               studies on electron transfer events at the acceptor side of                     photosystem II will emphasize experiments related to binding of                 additional chlorophyll(s) in the photosystem II reaction center                 complex as well as the role of the non-heme iron in photosystem II.             Another objective, to be achieved in collaboration with Dr.                     Shestakov and his group in Moscow (USSR), is to identify other                  regions of the D2 protein that are important towards photosystem                II function by random mutagenesis of psbD1.  A successful                       completion of this project is anticipated to markedly increase the              base of knowledge regarding the role of individual amino acid                   residues in function, folding and stable assembly of membrane                   proteins such as D2.                                                                                                                                            Energy from the sun is captured for biological use by the process               of photosynthesis.  The process of light harvesting is carried out              by two pigment-protein complexes, photosystems I and II.  Light                 energy absorbed by photosystem I is used by the cell for carbon                 fixation and chemical energy production.  Light energy absorbed by              photosystem II is essential for regenerating photosystem I which                loses electrons to cellular constituents.  Photosystem II, in turn,             is regenerated by the splitting of water, a process that liberates              dioxygen and accounts for the presence of oxygen in the earth's                 atmosphere.  This proposal describes molecular studies of a                     protein, D2, that is an essential part of photosystem II.  These                studies will help to elucidate how the process of water splitting               occurs at the molecular level.//",
