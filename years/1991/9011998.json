 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"How many times does the apple have to fall?\"  This question was                raised by then Representative Bowman who wanted to know why NSF                 needed to support a new biography of Newton given the many that                 already existed.  The question assumes that history is a static                 discipline--that history is simply a gathering of all the \"facts\"               to be set on the page in chronological order.  But the historian                is like the scientist--they continually seek to refine and improve              upon our understanding of events.  They offer new theories and                  gather new evidence to support them.  Eddington, for example,                   sought new evidence in the bending of light from star during a                  solar eclipse to establish Einstein's theory of gravity over                    Newton's. Similarly, historians turn to new kinds of evidence in                order to establish new interpretations of how and why historical                events came about.  This move to re-examine and re-interpret events             has hit at what had long been thought to be firmly established                  within the history of science:  the Scientific Revolution.                                                                                                      The Scientific Revolution of the 17th Century involved the                      overthrow of the Aristotelian world system and its replacement by               \"modern science.\"  The revolution began with Copernicus and ended               with Newton and his theory of universal gravitation.  Yet recent                historical scholarship has established that the success of                      Copernicanism around the turn of the 17th century was quite                     problematic and not explainable on any merely \"rational\" grounds.               Indeed, the Tychonic system, with the planets circling the sun, the             sun circling the immobile earth, made better sense than                         Copernicanism which so radically contradicted our common-sense                  understanding of the physical laws of motion.  But by mid-17th                  century, historians and philosophers had assumed that                           Aristotelianism was defeated and the triumph of modern physics was              clear.  Yet, Professors Ariew and Garber have found that even this              victory was nearly as problematic as the victory of Copernicanism.              They are examining the exact process of rejection of Aristotelian               natural philosophy during the early to mid-17th century.  Paris was             then home to a lively and independent intellectual community that               included many of the figures most responsible for the rise of the               new mechanical philosophy, while at the same time, the University               of Paris and numerous smaller colleges were strongholds of                      traditional Aristotelian thought.  Their project involves studying              intellectual currents both inside and outside the University,                   including published books, lecture notes, letters, pamphlets,                   broadsides, and engravings.  They hope to illuminate how, with                  specifics and in detail, the Aristotelian natural philosophy of the             schools was set aside and modern science emerged. The results of                the project should enhance our understanding of the complex                     relations among various scientific, philosophical and theological               doctrines, the intellectual context of early modern science, and                the status of scientific claims to authority.",
