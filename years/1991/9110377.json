 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-terms goals of this research are to understand the                     molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying mammalian learning                 and memory.  Experiments performed during the last few years have               provided a relatively detailed and testable model describing a                  complex cascade of biochemical events leading from certain                      patterns of electrical activity to long term changes in synaptic                efficacy.  Dr. Michel Baudry will continue his work on synaptic                 plasticity by using electrophysiological and biochemical                        techniques to evaluate the roles of regulatory mechanisms                       involved in the modulation of the properties of glutamate                       receptor subtypes in long-term potentiation and long-term                       depression in the hippocampus.  This work will be performed on                  mice, some of which are genetically different from others.                      Information obtained should provide a more refined description of               the mechanisms underlying learning and memory not only in adults,               but also during the postnatal development period and to relate                  learning abilities to different genotypes.  This research has                   broad implications as it might provide not only fundamental                     knowledge concerning cognitive processes but also tools to                      alleviate learning disorders during development.",
