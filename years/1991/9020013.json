 "awd_abstract_narration": "The flagellar apparatus structure of the colonial Volvocales               has turned out to be unexpectedly diverse.  This diversity is                   especially noteworthy in view of the evidence that members of                   this group have evolved from a Chlamydomonas-like ancestor with                 a \"typical\" chlorophycean flagellar apparatus.  The differences                 in flagellar structure can be hypothesized to result from either:               a) independent transitions from the unicellular to the colonial                 habit, or b) unusual plasticity in flagellar apparatus structure.               We cannot yet discriminate between these hypotheses because of                  the paucity of species examined.                                                     This project will study additional taxa of less uncertain                  affinities by detailed flagellar apparatus reconstruction at the                ultrastructural level, and by surveys of rootlet and flagellar                  positioning with immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody                 that recognized stable microtubules.  In addition, correlation                  of structure of the flagellar apparatus with flagellar                          functioning will be continued to understand better the effects of               possible selection pressures on flagellar apparatus structure.                       These studies will contribute to understanding of the                      phylogenetic relationships among algae in the \"volvocene line.\"                 In addition, they will give information on the evolutionary                     stability of the flagellar apparatus characters; this is                        especially important because the structure of the flagellar                     apparatus is being used increasingly in systematic studies of                   algae and protozoa at all levels.",
