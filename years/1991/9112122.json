These are important not                                             only for their role in amplification                                            of telecommunications signals, but                                              for a host of novel sensing                                                     applications.  The technique                                                    involves a novel aerosol technique                                              for the transport and incorporation                                             into the core of an optical fiber                                               preform rare earth elements whose                                               precursors have low vapor pressures.                                            Organic solids containing rare earth                                            elements are dissolved in liquid                                                organometallic compounds.  The                                                  resulting solution is nebulized and                                             the (approximately) four micron                                                 diameter droplets are convected by                                              means of a carrier gas into a                                                   substrate tube in the MCVD (Modified                                            Chemical Vapor /Deposition) process                                             used optical fiber preform                                                      fabrication.  At an appropriate heat                                            source, these particles then                                                    vaporize and react to form multi-                                               component oxide particles that are                                              thermophoretically deposited and                                                subsequently sintered.  This process                                            represents a new technique for the                                              formation of high purity glass, in                                              particular, for the cord doping of                                              fiber lasers using the MCVD process.                                            The PI seeks additional equipment to                                            aide in the characterization of                                                 these fiber lasers, and to assess                                               the role of co-doping on laser gain.",
