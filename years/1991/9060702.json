 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for new materials with improved properties is apparent                 from the substantial amount of time and money devoted to this                   research.  However, it is impossible using current technologies                 to produce materials with many combinations of properties that                  would have high commercial value.  However, organic/inorganic                   hybrid (OIH) materials offer a unique alternative to conventional               multiphase materials.  OIH materials involve the combination of                 organic and inorganic materials on a molecular level, avoiding                  the limitations of conventional multicomponent materials (i.e.,                 problems with uneven dispersion, limited molecular mixing, and                  weak interfaces between phases).  The goal of this program is to                develop polymeric OIH materials with superior thermal and                       mechanical properties by combining an organic and an inorganic                  precursor.  To achieve our goal we will examine how reaction                    variable can be varied to control the morphology and the thermal                and mechanical properties of the OIH materials.  In Phase I, we                 will demonstrate the feasibility of preparing two types of OIH                  materials with superior properties: 1) polymers that combine                    high permeability, and 2) ceramics that are less brittle and                    easier to process than conventional ceramics.  The most promising               of these materials will be optimized in Phase II, in preparation                for Phase III commercialization.",
