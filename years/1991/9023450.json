 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to                Dr. Martha P. Haynes of the Department of Astronomy, Cornell                    University.  The NSF Faculty Award for Women Scientists and                     Engineers recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in                teaching and scholarship as well as the potential for continued                 significant contributions to scientific research, the academic                  profession, and the education of future scientists.                                                                                                             During the next five years, the research will focus on how galaxy               formation and evolution is affected the environment in which a                  galaxy lives, primarily through ground-based radio and optical                  observations.  Of particular interest is how the fundamental                    properties of galaxies (mass, luminosity, etc.) reflect                         conditions early in a galaxy's history rather than later                        modifications due to evolutionary processes.                                                                                                                    The grant will be used to enlarge the research group,                           particularly with the addition of a postdoctoral research                       associate and an additional graduate student, as there is much                  fertile research to be done to follow through on the efforts of                 the last decade.  Towards the end of the five year grant period,                there will be early observations made with the upgraded Arecibo                 Observatory radio antenna and with the new 100m Green Bank                      Telescope.  Experiments not previously possible will be                         attempted.",
