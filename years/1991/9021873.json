 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Allegheny College for the repair and renovation of Carnegie Hall                which houses the Department of Psychology's behavioral science                  research and research activities.  This building was constructed                in 1915 and last renovated in 1960.  The ARFMP grant of $200,000                and $216,667 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used               to modernize these research and research training facilities. This              project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure by redesigning and equipping the existing research               space in keeping with changes in the study and practice of                      psychology in the last 30 years.  The crowded, outmoded facility                will be converted into a more efficient high quality space for                  research which will foster better focus, more continuity, and                   needed privacy in the conduct of student projects, and it will also             enable the conduct of a greater range of research activities than               is currently feasible.                                                                                                                                          This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate students in a research-               based curriculum in which they are actively engaged in hands-on                 experimentation and research from an early point in time in their               academic careers.  Allegheny College has a good record of students              majoring in science and continuing in science-related fields, and               the renovation of these facilities will help the College maintain               that record.",
