 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication and Control Systems have a common                                 theoretical core which permeates many applications.                             The Conference is devoted to this common theory, the                            development of related methodologies and their                                  multidisciplinary applications.  Applications will include                      aerospace systems, biomedicine and forestry, large-scale                        electric-power networks.  Special consideration of                              several of these topics will be given to energy and                             environmental issues.  Nonlinear control and related                            communication aspects of adaptive electric power                                transmission with the western grid (extending from                              British Columbia to Southern California) as a prime                             example will be emphasized in several sessions.  Here,                          the interaction of state tracking, fault detection, rapid                       communication of information and adaptive control are                           crucial to efficient, and safe transmission of energy                           over thousands of miles.                                                        Nonlinear phenomena, nonstationary and/or non-                                  Gaussian processes are common complexities in the                               above applications.  Hence, promising new methods of                            analysis will be emphasized in both sessions on theory                          and methodology.  Problems of System                                            Identification/Adaptive Control generally, which are                            essentially non-linear will be considered.",
