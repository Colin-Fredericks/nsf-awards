 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a model project focused on the Hispanic middle school                   eight grade population of the Philadelphia area to address the                  underrepresentation of Hispanics in engineering.  The project                   is a collaborative effort between a private research oriented                   University (University of Pennsylvania); LULAC, a non-profit                    organization serving the Hispanic community; four middle                        schools with a large Hispanic constituency; and the North                       Philadelphia Hispanic community.  It consists of weekly                         gatherings during the summer with 20 students and their parents                 in the Hispanic community of North Philadelphia.  These meeting                 are used to discuss the advantages, potentials and family                       infrastructure needs associated with a college education in the                 engineering sciences.  The students spend two days a week for                   10 weeks during the summer at the Penn campus to participate in                 workshops and other activities.  The purpose of these                           activities is to familiarize them with what engineering is                      about and what engineers do.  In addition to time on the Penn                   campus, the students visit local industries to allow for                        exposure to the engineering work environment.  A mentoring                      system has been designed in cooperation with Hispanic                           undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral                      fellows.  These individuals provide tutoring and academic                       guidance to the participating students; they are also                           responsible for explaining in detail the academic requirements                  and other needs involved in obtaining an engineering degree.",
