 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is to solve the problem of mapping          application algorithms developed for multilevel architectures, which            are more general than the standard-pyramid architecture, onto                   hypercube-based systems.  Hypercube-based systems are commercially              available and have widely been used by the scientific community                 because they are highly flexible, fault-tolerant, and efficient.                Researchers have been trying with success, to solve the problem of              embedding standard pyramids into hypercubes.  However, such embeddings          do not guarantee very high performance for all of the multilevel                algorithms, because the performance requirements of particular                  algorithms are not taken into account by the embedding process.  This           project will evolve through five phases.  The first phase will propose          algorithms for embedding multilevel structures into hypercubes.  The            second phase will be involved in the refinement of the embedding                algorithms proposed in the first phase, in such a way that the exact            computation and communication requirements of the application                   algorithms should affect the embeddings.  The third phase will attempt          modifications of the embedding algorithms proposed in the second                phase, so that they will be taking into account statistical                     performance data, in order to become suitable for the mapping of                non-deterministic and data-dependent multilevel algorithms.                     The fourth phase of this project will propose a class of \"multicube\"            systems, which, while providing smaller numbers of communication                channels, can yield performance comparable to that of the hypercube.            To conclude techniques for mapping multilevel algorithms onto                   hypercube-based and multicube systems will be developed.  Analytical            techniques and simulation results will be used to prove the                     effectiveness and efficiency of the mapping algorithms.",
