 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide information on scientist,                        engineer, and technician (SET) employment in industry.  It will                 develop national estimates from the ongoing Occupational                        Employment Statistics Survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics                  (BLS) which provides annual information on employment in detailed               occupations by industry.  The OES survey is a Federal-State                     cooperative program in which State Employment Security Agencies                 collect data following BLS specifications.  Data collection                     occurs on a three-year cycle, sequentially covering                             manufacturing,                   nonmanufacturing, and trade and                regulated (communications, public utilities, and transportation)                industries and colleges and universities.                                                                                                                            The OES data help NSF meet its  mandate under the National                 Science Foundation Act to develop and maintain a data base of                   demographic, educational, and employment information on SET. The                OES surveys are a key part of the system for developing such                    information.  Thus, the survey data:                                             a) help in developing an accurate profile of U. S. SET                              personnel;                                                                   b) are used in studying supply of and demand for scientists,                        engineers, and technicians;                                                   c) are used to develop current estimates of SET employment in                      total and by detailed SET field and industry; and                            d) allow identification of SET growth fields, and those in                          decline or otherwise changing.",
