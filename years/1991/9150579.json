 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project provides an option for fulfilling general                  education requirements which is an alternative to traditional                   General Biology/General Chemistry/Pnysical Science courses.  Ferrum             College will institute a series of courses called the Science 2000              Progra designed primarily to help non-science majors develop                    confidence and competence in dealing with scientific issues.  The               approach recognized the importance of incorporating knowledge of                student learning styles and motivation into science teaching.  For              the general education science requirement represents the capstone               of a student's science education, not an introduction to a                      scientific discipline.  The student should leave such courses                   understanding nature of scientific inquiry and the ability of                   scienc eto address meaningful issues and concerns.  This grant will             assist faculty in developing and implementing the philosophy of the             course through summer workshops and release time to concentrate on              course development and to interact and assist each other in                     developint the new approach.",
