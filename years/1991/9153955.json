 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal from the Technical Education Research Centers, Inc.          (TERC) to focus attention on the needs of educational telecomputing by          holding a founding meeting for a Consortium on Educational Telecomputing        with follow-on organizational activities.  The goal of the Consortium is        to improve education by stimulating the provision of quality                    telecomputing-based learning at the lowest possible cost to schools.            This Consortium would create and disseminate education telecomputing            software and curriculum in mathematics and science both by pooling              funding available to members and by seeking additional funding from             government and business.  The Consortium would also coordinate the              establishment and interconnection of networks and hosts.                                                                                                        The founding meeting of the Consortium is tentatively scheduled for             Cambridge April 18-19, 1991 with 55 participants of which 25 will be            subsidized by the requested funding.  TERC is contributing to the costs         of the meeting and additional funding is expected from corporate                sponsors.                                                                                                                                                       The establishment of this Consortium represents a novel development for         educational reform.  It is a conscious attempt to employ a strategy of          pooling interests and resources available to states, provinces and              corporations and others interested in education to create and share             software, curricula and expertise.  It envisions essentially public             dissemination mechanisms which could result in substantial savings at           the school level.  Although there are unique factors which favor the            success of this particular effort, the Consortium idea might have               application in other areas of interest to the NSF.  The conference also         provides a unique opportunity to both determine and influence the               planning of the states and other organizations concerning educational           telecomputing.  One of the results of the grant will be the broad               dissemination of a report that summarizes these issues.                                                                                                         This project is jointly supported by the programs for Applications of           Advanced Technology and Science & Mathematics Education Networks.",
