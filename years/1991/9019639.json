 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantitative understanding of the link between microbial loop                   organisms and suspension-feeding macrozooplankton is one of the                 central issues in zooplankton ecology today. This research                      project will utilize a newly developed immunochemical probe to                  ciliate protozoa to investigate this link in laboratory and field               studies. The probe overcomes the difficulties with conventional                 methodologies. It permits predation on microzooplankton to be                   studied without artifacts of collection, concentration,                         incubation, or preservation.                                                                                                                                    The following hypotheses will be tested:                                                                                                                        1. H0: A cross-shore gradient exists in the ciliate link to                     suspension-feeding copepods, from an inshore upwelling domain to                an offshore, stably stratified domain.                                                                                                                          2. H0: Temporal variations occur in the ciliate link to                         suspension-feeding copepods, with increased significance during                 relaxation of upwelling events.                                                                                                                                 3. H0: Interspecific differences exist in the importance of                     ciliates to co-occurring species of suspension-feeding copepods.                                                                                                     The study will contrast 3 major suspension-feeding copepods                in the California Current System: an epipelagic species (Calanus                pacificus californicus), a mesopelagic species (Eucalanus                       californicus), and a strong vertical migrant (Metridia pacifica).               Laboratory experiments will develop additional antisera and                     characterize predation rates on different ciliate taxa. Field                   research will be conducted in conjunction with the CalCOFI                      program. These cruises will address cross-shore and temporal                    variations in the ciliate link to  suspension-feeding copepods,                 utilizing immunochemical dot blots, gut fluorescenec, and                       Iatroscan lipid analyses.  Additional cruises  will address diel                and vertical variations, to examine any interspcific differences                in the  significance of this linkage to coexisting species of                   suspension-feeding zooplankton.",
