 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants respond to various signals such as hormones, light and                   gravity.  How plants perceive and transduce these chemical and                  physical signals is not clearly understood.  Accumulating evidence              indicates that calcium acts as a messenger in signal transduction               in plants.  Many of the signal-induced responses are mediated by                calcium.  Increased calcium can affect diverse physiological                    processes through the action of calmodulin, a ubiquitous calcium-               binding protein.  Much of this diversity in response in plants is               believed to be achieved by the modulation of the activity of the                calcium and/or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases.                    Although calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation is                implicated in regulating a number of cellular processes in plants,              nothing is known about the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein                 kinase(s) and its substrates.  Dr. Poovaiah has isolated several                cDNA clones by immunoscreening the expression libraries with the                antibody produced to the sequence corresponding to alpha subunit                of animal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.  The                  principal investigator proposes to perform biochemical analyses of              the encoded protein to verify its protein kinase activity,                      determine its mode of regulation by calcium and calmodulin, and                 analyze its substrate specificity.  Furthermore, Dr. Poovaiah                   intends to use auxin resistant mutants of Arabidopsis and light-                responsive corn mutant to study the role of calcium/calmodulin-                 dependent protein kinase in auxin and light signal transduction,                respectively.  The information derived from these studies would be              of immense value in understanding the role of calcium/calmodulin-               dependent protein kinase(s) in signal transduction in plants.//",
