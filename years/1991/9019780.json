 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to determine the cellular,                    physiological, and biophysical basis for gigantothermy in the                   leatherback sea turtle.  The following hypotheses will be tested:               1. The tissue metabolic rate of leatherback muscle is elevated                  above that of green turtles and intermediate between that of green              turtles and mammals.  2. Aerobic metabolism is the primary source               of energy for activity of nesting, and other exercise.  3.                      Leatherbacks maintain constant elevated body temperatures while                 active and at rest in both warm (tropical) and cold (north                      temperate) waters.  4. Blood flow to the skin and periphery is                  increased when on land, and while exercising in warm (tropical)                 waters, and reduced when in cold (north temperate) water.                                                                                                       These hypotheses will be tested by completing the following                     experiments: 1. Measure the tissue metabolic rate of the pectoral               muscles of leatherbacks and green turtles at temperatures from 5                to 35oC using a Gilson respirometer. 2. Measure the aerobic and                 anaerobic metabolic rates of adult leatherbacks while they are                  resting and active on land in the tropics and north temperate                   region. 3. Use multichannel sonic transmitters to measure the body              temperature of resting and active turtles in warm and cold waters.              4. Measure skin blood flow using the 133xenon washout technique.                Finally these data will be used to test a mathematical model that               predicts the effects of body size and metabolic rate on heat                    transfer and body temperatures of leatherbacks on land and in the               water.//",
