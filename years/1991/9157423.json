 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                 the Chemistry Division, Professor Webster will calculate the                    dynamics and reactions of isolated molecules and perform                        simulations of solvation and vibrational relaxation in                          molecular liquids. A newly developed quantum molecular dynamics                 algorithm for the real-time simulation of quantum dynamics in                   condensed matter will be used to model the transient bleach                     recovery of the absorption of excess electrons in molecular                     liquids. The techniques will be extended to many-body quantum                   dynamics in order to accurately describe vibrational relaxation                 and vibration-rotation and vibration-vibration energy transfer                  in neat liquids and in mixtures. Environmental perturbations on                 electronic structure will be incorporated into the quantum                      molecular dynamics algorithm either through parameterization of                 environmental effects or through electronic calculations                        performed in parallel with dynamics runs. This hybrid scheme                    will describe the dynamics responsible for electronic                           relaxation, electronic dephasing and line widths, and the                       chemistry of radicals and open shell species in solution.                       %%%                                                                             This Presidential Young Investigator award will support the                     research of Dr. Frank J. O. Webster in the area of molecular                    dynamics. These simulations of molecular dynamics in solutions                  will lead to a better understanding of chemical reactions,                      nonlinear transport, and photoselective chemistry in solution.",
