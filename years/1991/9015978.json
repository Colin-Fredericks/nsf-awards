 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multi-scale Galerkin methods will be developed for the study of                 structural/building systems in which the response is characterized              by multiple-spatial and multiple-time scales.  For this type of                 structural problems, the response is often dominated by the middle              part of the frequency spectrum, which in this proposal is referred              ta as medium frequency dynamic analysis.  New temporal and spatial              discretization methods will be developed for the multi-time scale               structural dynamic problems.  The concept of fast and slow time                 scales will be introduced for the temporal discretization.  The                 required time step is shown to be dependent only on the slow time               scale, and therefore, large time step can be used for the high                  frequency problems.  To meet the spatial counterpart of the                     requirement on time step requirement, finite-spectral elements and              finite wave elements will also be developed.  These developed                   methods will be applied to building systems, and nonlinear dynamic              buckling of fluid-filled shell structures.",
