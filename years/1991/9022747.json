 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shift-share analyses are used by geographers, regional scientists,         economists, and other social scientists to explore the nature of                interconnections in economic and social systems.  By examining changes          in statistical associations in data among subunits (such as states,             economic sectors, or groups of people) as parts of a larger entity              (such as a nation, an economy, or a population) over a specific time            period, shift-share analysis helps identify the degree to which changes         over time are a function of broad variations across the entire entity           (\"shares\") and the degree to which they relate to differential                  developments among the subunits (\"shifts\").  Although shift-share               analysis explicitly focuses on changes in patterns over time, it has            been criticized by many scientists as being overly deterministic and as         incapable of elucidating the processes that produce those changes.              This project will explore alternate forms of shift-share analysis based         in probabilistic statistical approaches.  These approaches differ from          conventional accounting-system approaches.  By basing his work on the           fact that probabilistic shift-share analysis is a special case of more          general statistical models, the investigator will extend probabilistic          shift-share approaches to include interaction terms among variables.            He also will evaluate algorithms designed to estimate parameters in             probabilistic shift-share analyses, and he will compare the results of          probabilistic shift-share methods with results obtained using more              conventional approaches.                                                             This research will address some important methodological issues            that have limited the potential utility of shift-share analysis.  This          project will explore the statistical foundations of the procedure and           will develop it within a probabilistic framework, which should provide          a sounder basis for quantitative testing of hypotheses about changes in         economic activity, employment, and population.",
