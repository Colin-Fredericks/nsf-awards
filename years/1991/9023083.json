 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objectives of the project are to undertake additional                  extensions and refinements of the semi-nonparametric (SNP) approach             to modeling multiple time series. The SNP approach is based on a                Hermite series expansion of the conditional density of a strictly               stationary multivariate process. The leading term is either a                   linear vector autoregressive model or an autoregressive conditional             heteroskedastic model, with the choice depending upon the                       application. Higher order terms accommodate deviations from the                 leading term, including, for example, non-normalities or                        nonlinearities.                                                                                                                                                 The work is in two parts: a methodological section and an empirical             section. The methodological work entails developing new ways to use             the SNP approach for nonparametric structural estimation and to                 ascertain the dynamics embodied in an SNP estimate of the                       conditional density. The empirical work involves applications of                SNP methods to issues in asset pricing and financial volatility.                The main research tools for the empirical work are nonlinear                    maximum likelihood estimation and Monte Carlo simulation.                                                                                                       The work will have an impact in several areas: documenting                      interesting regularities in financial time series data, forecasting             turning points in economic data, and allowing estimation of what                would previously be considered intractable models. Dissemination                of the computer code developed by the project will be an important              addition to the econometrics infrastructure.",
