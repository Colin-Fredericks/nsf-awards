This wing was                 constructed in 1952 and has not been renovated since that time.                 The ARFMP grant of $250,000 and $305,238 provided by the grantee                as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                    research training facilities.  This project will address the need               to improve the current research infrastructure by (a) redesigning               the research laboratories to make more efficient use of space,                  substantially increasing both hood and bench space; (b) providing               the stockroom with adequate ventilation and flammable solvent                   storage; and (c) redesigning the instrument room to more optimally              house modern electronic instrumentation.                                                                                                                        This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate students in a department              in which the faculty and their students publish their work                      regularly in top journals and which has produced a large number of              chemists over the years.",
