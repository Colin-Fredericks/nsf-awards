The                      background characteristics of equally-sharing couples, the ways                 in which they develop an equal division of childcare                            responsibilities, and the impact of this nontraditional division                of labor on wives, husbands, marriages, and children will be                    examined.  The project will entail three phases:  1) telephone                  interviews with husbands and wives in 400 couples, designed to                  identify a sample of equal-sharing couples and to illuminate the                factors that influence parents' assessments of the division of                  childcare; 2) of paternal participation, including 60 middle-                   class and working class couples who share parenting equally; 3) a               set of interviews with husbands and wives in 30 expectant couples               who intend to share parenting equally and follow-up interviews                  with husbands and wives in the original 60 equally sharing                      couples.  The research will inform our understanding of the                     development of identity in adulthood, the link between sex-role                 ideology and family organization, the barriers that keep men from               full participation in the family, and the potential benefits that               fathers' full participation might bring.",
