 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is introducing 16 undergraduate computer science                   faculty to parallel computing.  When they have completed the                    project they will not only be prepared to develop an undergraduate              course on parallel computing, but also to assess the feasibility                of establishing an undergraduate parallel processing laboratory at              their own college and to be aware of the possibilities for                      incorporating aspects of parallel computing into other courses.                 The project begins with an intensive two-week course in the summer              of 1991.  The course includes lectures surveying the broad scope                of parallel computing and instruction on the design and                         implementation of parallel algorithms.  About half the time during              this course will be spent doing hands-on programming.  There will               be a parallel development workstation for every participant and                 four parallel computers (three with sixteen processors, one with                eight processors) for running and benchmarking the programs.                    During the Fall, participants will work on larger projects, with                site visits from the instructors and/or visits back to Colgate.                 In January 1992 there will be a one-week seminar during which                   participants will present their projects and discuss the practical              aspects of teaching parallel programming to undergraduates.",
