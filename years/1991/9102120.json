 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Mexico award supports Professor F. Stuart                             Chapin of the University of California-Berkeley in                              collaboration with Professor Emmanuel Rincon of the                             Ecology Center of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma                             de Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City, Mexico.  The major                             objective of the proposed research is to understand                             the effects of variation in resource supply on the                              growth of tree species from dry tropical forests.                               The researchers will combine glasshouse field and                               laboratory studies to test a series of hypotheses                               concerned with the role of plasticity and                                       mycorrhizae in resource capture and use.  They will                             determine whether the extent of plasticity that a                               species exhibits influences its capacity to exploit                             temporal pulses of light, water, and nutrients, and                             whether  differences in plasticity affect the                                   outcome of competition among species either in                                  simple experimental microcosms or in synthetic                                  communities.  Finally they will explore the role                                that mycorrhizae play in influencing competition                                and species interactions in communities.                                                                                                                        The proposed research provides an opportunity to                                combine the complementary research expertise of                                 researchers with substantially different                                        backgrounds.  The Mexican PI has worked extensively                             on studies of relative growth rate and plasticity                               in plants while the U.S. PI's work has dealt more                               with mineral nutrition.  The project will also                                  involve Professor Edith Allen from San Diego State                              University and her expertise on mycorrhizal                                     techniques will add an essential component to the                               proposed research.",
