The subject of lifeline engineering                                    involves safety, reliability, and related                                       applications of probabilistic analysis as                                       they relate to traditional engineering                                          principles such as structural, geotechnical,                                    and network analysis.  These interrelated and                                   interacting subjects make lifeline earthquake                                   engineering a complex subject area requiring                                    advanced techniques for development and                                         dissemination of theory and methods.                                                                                                                            This project is to provide travel funds nd                                      per diem costs for distinguished keynote                                        speakers at the Third U.S. Conference on                                        Lifeline Earthquake Engineering which will be                                   held at UCLA, in Los Angeles, California on                                     August 22-23, 1991, organized by the American                                   Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).  The                                         Lifeline Earthquake Engineering Conferences                                     are international in significance, and also                                     cover all technological areas with regard to                                    safety and reliability of lifelines subject                                     to earthquake hazards.  The Conference will                                     emphasize recent advances in Lifeline                                           Earthquake Engineering, and will contribute                                     to the development of new knowledge and                                         improved performance of lifelines which may                                     be subject to earthquakes.  Its goal is to                                      help establish methods of engineering                                           practice and policy for mitigating earthquake                                   effects on an infrastructure, and the                                           potential loss of property, human life, and                                     societal productivity arising from the                                          functional and physical failure of critical,                                    complex civil engineering systems due to                                        earthquake.",
