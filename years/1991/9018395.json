 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will make cosmological measurements of two distinctly              different types.                                                                                                                                                1.   The experimenters will make cosmic microwave background                    radiation (CMBR) measurements of the absolute brightness of the sky             above South Pole at three frequencies, 1.0, 1.5 and 7.5 GHz.                    Similar measurements were made at the higher two frequencies from               Pole in 1989, but the 1.0 GHz radiometer is new.  The purpose is                to determine if there are deviations from the CMBR temperature of               2.735 K which has been measured at higher frequencies, most notably             by the new NASA satellite Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE).                    Deviations, at different wavelengths, from the 2.736 K figure would             indicate that there has been an input of significant energy into                the universe since the time of the big bang.                                                                                                                    2.   They will attempt to measure microwave radiation coming                    upwards from the polar ice sheet, which is over two kilometers                  thick at South Pole.  It has been hypothesized that extremely                   energetic neutrinos that have passed entirely through the Earth can             interact in the ice, or rocks just below, and cause a                           electromagnetic shower that could result in detectable radio                    emissions.  If this is true, then the polar ice sheet could be used             as a vast detector for the new field of neutrino astronomy.                                                                                                     This project is jointly funded by the Divisions of Polar Programs               and Astronomy.",
