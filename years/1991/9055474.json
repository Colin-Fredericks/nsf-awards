 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences plans to conduct a 5                    year project to train 150 mentor teachers (30 teachers/year)                    and their principals, who will then train the remaining 1100                    elementary teachers in the Buffalo Public School System.                        The training would include two 5-week summer sessions  (in a                    Magnet school that is physically incorporated into the                          Buffalo Museum of Science) and 4 in-service workshops during                    the academic years following each of the summer workshops.                      This innovative leadership project is a collaborative effort                    between the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences (including                      both education and curatorial/science staff persons) the                        Buffalo Public Schools, and individuals from local colleges                     and universities.  The setting of the project is enhanced by                    a Science and Math Magnet School which is housed within the                     museum, and by the school/museum's location in a largely                        inner city environment with easy accessibility to minority                      persons.                                                                                                                                                        The project is designed to provide mentor teachers with a                       strong science background in pedagogy and content over a                        two-year period of summer and academic-year workshops, and                      to prepare and support these mentors as they inservice their                    colleagues.  Project staff from the museum, public schools,                     and the academic community will provide strong support                          through academic-year workshops, site visits and                                telecommunications networking.  Principals will be                              appropriately involved, and will work with mentors to                           develop a science inservice program tailored to meet the                        needs of their individual schools; as a consequence,                            virtually all of the 1100 K-6 classroom teachers of science                     in the Buffalo Public Schools will have been prepared to                        teach investigative, hands-on science to their students.                                                                                                        Non-NSF cost sharing is approximately 27.9% of the amount                       requested from NSF.",
