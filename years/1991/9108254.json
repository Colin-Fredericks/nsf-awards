 "awd_abstract_narration": "A family H of square matrices is efficiently structured if                 the number of independent parameters required to specify an                     arbitrary n by n member of H is approximately proportional to n                 when n is large.  Toeplitz, Hankel, and Toeplitz-plus-Hankel                    matrices are examples of efficiently structured matrices, as are                matrices of a given displacement rank, as defined by T. Kailath                 and his coauthors. The purposes of the proposed research are (a)                to develop fast algorithms for finding individual                               eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs for general classes of efficiently                 structured Hermitian matrices, analogous to the principal                       investigator's algorithms for Toeplitz and Toeplitz-plus-Hankel                 matrices; (b) to study spectral properties of Toeplitz matrices                 (especially, the relationship between the even and odd spectra of               real symmetric Toeplitz matrices); (c) to investigate the                       possibility of devising fast algorithms for finding the real                    eigenvalues of nonsymmetric Toeplitz matrices; and (d) to                       consider the spectral properties of Toeplitz-Sturm matrices.                         Efficiently structured Hermitian matrices arise in many                    important physical and scientific applications, including                       statistical problems involving prediction of future values of a                 random variable based on observations of its past values, signal                processing (the science of extracting information from                          transmitted signals), and geophysical applications including the                study of free oscillations of the Earth and seismic phenomena                   such as earthquakes.  In studying these problems it is often                    necessary to determine individual eigenvalues of                                efficiently structured matrices of very high order (in the                      thousands).  One of the main objectives of the proposed research                is to develop numerical methods for finding these eigenvalues by                methods whose complexity (computational requirements) is                        proportional to the second power of the order of the matrix,                    rather than to the third power of the order, as it is for                       standard computational methods that do not take advantage of the                special structure of the matrix.",
