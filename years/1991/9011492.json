 "awd_abstract_narration": "While considerable research has been done on the politics,                      economics, and cultural implications of technological change,                   most such work does not integrate either the various facets of                  technological change or the technological artifact with its                     dialectically-linked social meaning.  In this study of                          technology, productivism, and consumerism in interwar France, Dr.                                                                                               Frost is utilizing an integrated theory and methodology to                      explain the emergence of a set of technologically linked cultural                                                                                               images and the social impact of technological discourse within                  French society at a time when the breadth of technological change                                                                                               was slight.  This research focuses particularly upon the                        contradiction between an emerging modernist view of \"progress\"                  and a genuine lack of concrete technological change.  An                        integrated approach like the one that Dr. Frost is using offers                 an opportunity to observe and define the mutual prestructuring of                                                                                               technological text and social context.   Techniques for this                    study therefore stretch from technical design analysis, through                 micro- and macroeconomic calculation, to the analysis and                       interpretation of technological discourse--from economics to                    semiotics--using a range of sources from demographic and economic                                                                                               statistics to trade fairs and advertising brochures.  this study                                                                                                is developing conclusions about the processes of innovation and                 diffusion, the invention of new social roles concurrent with the                                                                                                invention f artifacts, the economics and finances of innovation,                                                                                                and the fracture between technological images and artifacts in                  interwar (1919-1930) France.  The results should prove                          extraordinarily helpful in pointing the way toward a                            comprehensive approach to the study of the processes of                         technological innovation.",
