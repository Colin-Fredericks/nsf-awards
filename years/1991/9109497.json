 "awd_abstract_narration": "An implementation of a shared data object is wait-free if the                   operations of the data object are implemented without any unbounded             busy-waiting loops or idle-waiting primitives.  Wait-free shared data           objects are inherently resilient to fail-stop faults:  a process that           fails (i.e., stops its execution) while accessing such a data object            cannot block the progress of any other process; intuitively, a faulty           process has the same effect on other processes as a very slow one.              Two research projects are contained herein, both of which extend                previous work on wit-free shared data objects.  The first project               considers the implementation of wait-free shared data objects with              read-modify-write operations.  Such operations lie at the heart of              many transaction processing applications; thus, because wait-free               shared data objects are inherently fault tolerant, this work offers an          attractive alternative to more traditional transaction processing               schemes, such as checkpointing, logging, timeouts, etc.  The second             project considers the construction of wait-free shared data objects in          message-passing systems.  Such data objects provide the illusion of a           fault-tolerant, virtual shared memory machine, and thus allow                   programmers to think in terms of shared memory when designing fault-            tolerant algorithms for message-passing systems.",
