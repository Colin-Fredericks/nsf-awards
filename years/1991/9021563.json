 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vocal communication in vertebrate animals is one behavior                  that displays sexually dimorphic characteristics (i.e., males and               females are different).  Dr. Bass has chosen to study teleost                   fishes as a model system of this type of behavior.  In the                      species to be studied males generate vocalizations in order to                  attract females to the nest, but no such behavior is seen in the                females.  In previous studies it has been shown that the                        behavioral sex differences in vocalizations are correlated with                 anatomical and physiological traits of the muscles and neurons                  that comprise the sonic motor pathway.  The proposed research                   will study the underlying basis of these differences.  The                      electrophysiological properties of the nerve cells involved in                  these responses will be analysed.  The morphological features and               the chemical nature of specific nerve cells in this system will                 be identified.  Changes induced by testosterone, a reproductively               active steroid hormone, will be measured both physiologically and               anatomically.  These studies will contribute to fundamental                     knowledge about the role of steroid hormones in the regulation of               nerve cell function and sexually differentiated behaviors in                    vertebrates.",
