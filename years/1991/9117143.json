 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates an advanced heterogeneous database                   environment for engineering design, with emphasis on using design               knowledge and relating design decisions to design versions. The                 environment uses a blackboard approach to coordinate, integrate,                and monitor product development. An object-oriented database                    provides an integrated, logical view of complex design entities                 that are stored in a variety of databases. Designers therefore                  have a global view of how heterogeneous data repositories form                  the complete product design. The blackboard also coordinates                    access to expert systems and deductive databases to provide                     engineering design knowledge. Design histories are captured as a                series of design development steps and the corresponding                        engineering knowledge is used in each step and resulting                        decision. Both navigational and knowledge-based approaches to                   querying design histories are used. The impact of this research                 on database technology will be the advancement of heterogeneous                 databases through the use of object-oriented concepts to achieve                a tightly-coupled view of design data. Object-oriented concepts                 will also be extended with a process model for capturing and                    querying design histories.  This research will also lead to the                 improvement of the engineering design productivity by providing                 an integrated view of design knowledge and data and by supporting               the ability to query design histories allowing re-use of previous               designs.",
