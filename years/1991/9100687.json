 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus and central theme of the 1991 Symposium on the                   Interface of Computing Science and Statistics will be on a variety              of critical applications of scientific (including statistical)                  computing and the research challenges that they present.  Sessions              are planned on computational genetics, medical imaging, and                     labelled point data, which arise in evolutionary biology as well as             imaging.  Another application area will be engineering, including               speech recognition, satellite imaging, and software engineering.                The meeting will be held in conjunction with a Workshop on                      Computational Molecular Biology.                                                     The Symposium and Workshop are being held in Seattle,                      Washington on April 21-24, 1991.  The Symposium is organized to                 capitalize on the natural synergy that the Workshop offers as well              as on the technical strengths in computing and engineering at                   Boeing and in biostatistics, computer science, engineering, and                 medicine at the University of Washington.  A series of technical                tutorials on computer science topics will be offered to encourage               statisticians and other applications-oriented participants to learn             about key ideas and new technologies that are needed for interface              work.",
