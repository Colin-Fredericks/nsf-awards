 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of six U.S.                           scientists in a joint seminar on \"Selectivity in Synthetic                      and Bio-organic Chemistry,\" to be held in Tokyo, Japan, June                    2-7, 1991.  The focus of the meetings will be on the dynamic                    scientific advances in the area of asymmetric synthesis,                        which spans the entire spectrum of organic and inorganic                        chemistry.  A U.S.-Japan seminar on this subject in 1981                        served as an opportunity for research groups in the two                         countries to share ideas and information.  During the last                      decade, however, there has been a virtual explosion in the                      discovery of reactions that deliver levels of stereocontrol                     once thought to be impossible to achieve via non-enzymatic                      means.  The impact of these new tools, coupled with the new                     enzymatic and microbial technologies, has dramatically                          redefined the way absolute stereochemical,  regiochemical and                   functional group selectivity issues in synthesis are being                      addressed in both academic and industrial environments.  A                      multitude of new chiral reagents and catalysts now exist that                   are capable of exerting near-perfect control over those bond                    constructions where new stereochemical relationships are                        established.  The development of these new technologies are                     based on recent, deep understanding of fundamental issues of                    selectivity and molecular recognition.  The enormous importance                 of this area is manifested in the highly international and                      cross-disciplinary nature of the primary contributions in                       the literature.                                                                                                                                                 The co-organizers of the seminar are Professor Robert M.                        Williams of Colorado State Unversity and Professor Kenji Koga                   of the University of Tokyo.  The main topics to be discussed                    are new asymmetric synthetic methodologies; enzymatic, whole                    cell and cell-free bio-reactor technologies; total synthesis                    of natural products; biosynthesis; catalytic antibodies; and                    reaction mechanisms.  In addition, a poster session will be                     organized for young Japanese industrial chemists.",
