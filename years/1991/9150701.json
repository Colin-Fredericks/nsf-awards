 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develop a new course, Problem Solving for Computer                 Science.  This course is not a computer literacy course and is                  not an introductory programming course.  It addresses problem                   solving skills, knowledge of computer organization. and                         computer usage skills required for the study of computer                        science. The intent of this course is to increase the retention                 of students who might otherwise be excluded from pursuing the                   study of computer science.  The success of this approach could                  have a wide impact on undergraduate computer science education.                  With the development of an appropriate textbook and other                      course materials, this approach could be implemented in                         virtually any college or university computer science program as                 it requires no modification to established courses in computer                  science.  The accompanying discrete mathematics course is                       already a standard requirement of computer science programs.                    The project seeks to:1. identify students who are likely to be                  unsuccessful in introductory computer science, 2. design a                      course which addresses the skills these students lack, 3.                       implement this new course, and4. evaluate the value of this                     course in increasing the success rate of students who take it.",
