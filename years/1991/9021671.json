 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research aims at developing a fundamental understanding of                  shear-band initiation and propagation.  The materials that will be              investigated, titanium and aluminum alloys, have great importance               in the aerospace industry; they undergo shear localization during               plastic deformation and this is an important practical problem.                 Systematic and integrated experimental and theoretical                          investigation of the phenomenon of shear-band formation will be                 carried out.  This will lead to the prediction and control of shear             instability and to the establishment of its effect on the strength              and failure modes of a broad class of materials.  Dynamic                       experiments will be performed, in order to generate shear bands                 under controlled conditions.  The Hopkinson bar experimental                    technique will be used with both hat-shaped and double-notched                  specimens.  Pulse amplitude and shape in the Hopkinson bar will be              varied to control the extent of shear-band propagation.  This will              be followed by microstructural characterization involving optical,              scanning, and transmission electron microscopy.  The microstructure             after controlled high-strain-rate deformation stages and prior to               the onset of macroscopic shear localization, will also be                       systematically investigated in order to establish which internal                defects can lead to the initiation of localization and to                       characterize the microstructural evolution.  The microstructure at              the tip of the shear band will be examined in order to establish                the structural changes in this zone prior to shear band extension.",
