 "awd_abstract_narration": "The distribution of warm-climate flora and fauna to high                   paleolatitudes during times of global warming (Cretaceous through               Eocene) is a prime criterion arguing for a decreased range in                   seasonal temperature variation for the interiors of large                       continents.  Such interpretations, however, are in conflict with                predictions based on Energy Balance and General Circulation Climate             Models.  According to modeling studies, in contrast to warm and                 equable oceanic and coastal environments during periods of high                 latitude warming of the ocean, continental interiors should retain              a wide range of seasonal temperature variation.  As a test of this              hypothesis, this study will provide quantitative measures of                    minimum seasonal temperature variation present within the                       continental interior of North America utilizing del 18O variation               in fossil marine and non-marine bivalves.  Advances in sampling                 techniques now permit microanalysis of the accretionary growth                  structure present in bivalves, with a time resolution of weekly to              submonthly intervals.  Evaluation of these data from sequential                 stratigraphic levels will constrain temporal changes in seasonality             and mean annual temperature in the interior of North America from               late Cretaceous to late Eocene times.",
