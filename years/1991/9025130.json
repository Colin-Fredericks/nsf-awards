 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subfield of International Relations has seen a proliferation                of exciting new theories over the past twenty years.                            Important theories have been advanced to account for the                        onset and diffusion of war among both superpowers and smaller                   states, the dynamics of international arms races, the structure                 and operation of the international economy including trade flows                and international development, and the causes of internal                       violence including revolutions, rebellions, coups d'etat, and                   assassination to cite only a few of the fronts on which social                  science theory has been advanced.  Although considerable energy                 also has been devoted to efforts to test these theories                         empirically, the absence of an extensive body of reliable time-                 series data on international events has impeded progress.                                                                                                       This award supports continuation of a long term project -- Data                 Development in International Research (DDIR) -- to maintain,                    extend and improve the quality of major databanks for the study                 and analysis of cross-national and international political                      events.  The first stage of DDIR filled in and updated major                    international data sets.  This second stage will continue to                    update the collections while establishing a more permanent base                 for future data collection efforts.  Specifically, the project                  has two principal thrusts: 1) to update and extend the four main                event datasets, COPDAB, WEIS, BCOW, and SHERFACS, and 2) to                     develop the computer technology that will simplify data                         collection efforts and reduce their costs to levels that do not                 require continuing federal support.                                                                                                                             When completed this project will provide a much larger, more                    complete, and more reliable set of data with which to test and                  refine existing theories in international and cross-national                    politics.",
