 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the topic of robust control of mechanical               systems.  Robustness is required because of the nonlinear and                   uncertain character of such systems.  The robust control problem                is the problem of designing a fixed, or deterministic state                     feedback control to stabilize a dynamical system with significant               bounded uncertainties while meeting the design requirements.  The               Lyapunov approach to robustness, one of several currently popular               approaches, will be used in this project.  Current shortcomings                 associated with the approach include (1) the control makes the                  system only  uniformly ultimately bounded and not asymptotically                stable, (2) the control only applies to systems which satisfy the               so called 'matching condition', and (3) it is usually necessary                 to make assumptions about the allowable size of the system                      uncertainties.  The objectives of this project are to overcome                  these shortcomings.  The research is aimed at making robust                     control of nonlinear systems a practical tool.",
