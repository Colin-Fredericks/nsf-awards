 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jackson State University (JSU) is unique among Historically                   Black Colleges and Universities in its undergraduate                            meteorology program.  The physics program too is turning out                    highly-qualified students.  Through the two programs, the                       Department of Physics and Atmospheric Sciences has made                         significant contributions is preparing minorities for the work                  forces and for graduate programs.  The maine goal of this                       proposed project is to prepare and motivate minority                            undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees and/or professional                   careers in physics and atmospheric sciences.  The project                       objectives include the following components:  (1) the offering                  to high ability undergraduate students early research                           experience by working with dedicated mentors and role models                    during the academic year at JSU; (2) the development of                         academic enrichment activities which will maintain and enhance                  the interest of the students in physics and atmospheric                         sciences' (3) the provision of opportunities for students to                    participate in off-campus research during the summer months,                    and (4) the production of graduates in physics and atmospheric                  science who will be prepared to pursue graduate studies in                      these fields.                                                                     Students will be required to take special courses which will                  consist of supervised research projects, and formalized                         training in technical writing and literature survey as well as                  laboratory experimentation.  Besides written reports, students                  will make at least one oral presentation of their research.                     Students will travel to at least one conference or meeting                      related to their research experiences, and will be encouraged                   to present papers where possible and appropriate.  Field                        trips, seminars, etc. will be organized.  Participating                         faculty mentors will be expected to accompany students to                       conferences and professional meetings.",
