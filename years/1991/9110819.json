 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deposit feeders ingest bulk sediment and digest associated                      organic components, and they thus can affect rates and extents                  of organic matter degradation and burial in the sediments.  How                 deposit feeders make a living by exploiting a food resource,                    the bulk of which is mineral grains, is as yet poorly                           understood.  Within the framework of digestion theory and gut-                  reactor models can provide a rigorous framework for quantifying                 digestive processes.  However, quantitative application of the                  theory and models requires description of digestive reaction                    kinetics, and the enzymology of digestion in deposit feeders is                 poorly known.  I thus propose to develop a research program to                  describe and quantify enzymatic digestion in deposit feeders,                   i.e. to identify and quantify the digestive parameters that ate                 represented in gut-reactor models by the variable, -rA, the                     expression for digestive reaction rate.                                                                                                                         The ultimate goal of my research is to determine the ranges of                  digestive performance exhibited by deposit feeders as food                      resources vary.  The specific goals of this planning proposal                   are to determine the suites of digestive enzymes present in                     deposit feeders' guts and to determine the potential for                        changes in enzyme complements and activities in response to                     changes in food resources (physiological acclimation).                          Identification of the types of enzymes present in deposit                       feeders' guts is a necessary starting point for studies of                      digestive performance.  I also propose to conduct several                       simple digestive acclimation experiments to determine how the                   types and amounts of enzymes present in a deposit feeders' gut                  may vary with food resources.  The combination of a descriptive                 survey with experimental examinations of digestive acclimation                  of food resources will provide the foundation for future                        studies of digestive performance.",
