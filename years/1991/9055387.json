 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three year program that offers five-week                      teacher enhancement summer institutes, followed by academic                     year curriculum development activity.  The summer institutes                    will be held at Mankato State University.  A total of 72                        middle school science teachers (24 per year), from a six                        state Midwest region, will participate in summer research                       experiences and presentations in the subject area of soil                       biology/agroecology.  Teachers will have the opportunity to                     study the organisms in soils, apply what they learn to                          issues in agroecology, and participate in writing, testing,                     and revision of classroom materials.  Laboratory materials                      to be used are readily available to participant teachers and                    their students for in-class experimentation and study.                          Research projects undertaken by the participants will be                        designed for transport back to the home classroom to engage                     students in the projects, and will not require complex                          instrumentation and techniques.                                                                                                                                 Each teacher will provide in-service training for                               colleagues.  Included will be 6 one-week workshops conducted                    by two teacher teams at different locations within the                          region.  At least 60 additional teachers will be trained in                     these workshops to conduct similar research activities with                     their students.  These workshops will be funded, in part, by                    local funding.                                                                                                                                                  An amount equal to 20.5 % of NSF costs has been provided as                     cost sharing.",
