Past studies of regulation following                       experimental disturbance have demonstrated that abundant buried                 seed and localized disturbances combine to activate incipient                   weed outbreaks, and that interspecific plant competition and                    herbivory by the ragwort flea beetle and the cinnabar moth                      combine to inhibit the increase and spread of incipient                         outbreaks.

They will conduct a field experiment that manipulates                   disturbances area and levels of cinnabar moth, flea beetle, and                 plant competition to test the response of biological control                    system to spatial variation in the disturbances regime.
