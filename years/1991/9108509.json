 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support exploratory research on an                          innovative method of designing a fixed-bed adsorption                           column for removing organic pollutants from aqueous                             solution.  Conventional engineering design results in                           placement of the adsorbing media in a cylindrical                               configuration.  In this research, the investigator plans                        to experimentally evaluate the alternative of placing the                       adsorbent (activated carbon) in a conical, tapered-bed                          configuration as an alternative to batch reactors,                              continuous-flow stirred tank reactors and columns of                            fixed, fluidized or moving beds.                                                                                                                                This proposal was submitted under conditions listed in NSF                      89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory (SGER).  It addresses                       the problem resulting when organic pollutants are present                       in surface and groundwaters or are produced during the                          treatment process for polluted waters and must be removed                       to bring the water to acceptable standards for commercial,                      industrial and domestic use.  Results are expected to                           improve the process by which engineers approach the design                      of adsorption processes in treatment of water and                               wastewater.",
