 "awd_abstract_narration": "A framework for studying the interactions among loop transformation             and scheduling strategies and a parallelization tool that allows                experimentation with alternative parallelization strategies will be             developed.  The tool will accept architectural information to assist            in the application of transformations and selection of schedules.  The          results obtained from studying these interactions will be applied in            the development of an integrated approach to loop transformation and            scheduling.  In this approach the loop parallelization process will be          composed of three major phases.  The first phase, the parallelism               detection phase, will perform dependency analysis to identify loops             that can be executed in parallel.  In addition, it will perform                 transformations, such as renaming, to convert sequential loops into             parallel loops.  The second phase, the parallelism scheduling phase,            will select an appropriate scheduling strategy.  The goal here will be          to choose a strategy that involves minimal run-time scheduling                  overhead and results in schedules that provide good load balancing and          high processor utilization.  The final phase, the parallelism                   enhancement phase, will transform the loops to increase the efficiency          with which parallelism is exploited.  The transformations that exploit          architectural characteristics will be applied to reduce                         synchronization and communication overhead.  Any decisions to utilize           special hardware features will be made in this phase.  Decisions of             activities performed in the later phases will be based upon the                 decisions made in the earlier phases.  An integrated strategy will              allow convenient application of transformations after schedules have            been generated.  It will also ensure that the scheduling strategy does          not undo the effects of transformations that had been applied.",
