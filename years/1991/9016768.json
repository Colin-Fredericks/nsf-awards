 "awd_abstract_narration": "The factors that control the production and depletion of                   supercooled water in the atmosphere are important to a variety of               scientific and practical issues including the production of                     precipitation and aircraft icing.  Under joint NSF and FAA                      sponsorship, the Winter Icing and Storms Project (WISP) will be                 held in the winter of 1991 in the front range of Colorado.  The                 primary goals of the WISP are to improve understanding of                       processes involved in the production and depletion of supercooled               liquid water content in winter storms and to improve forecast of                aircraft icing in winter storms.                                                                                                                                The Principal Investigator will participate in WISP by studying                 the dynamical and microphysical processes in mesoscale                          snowbands.  The research will have two primary objectives.  First               of all, the storm flow fields derived from Doppler radar will be                used as input to a numerical model to investigate the important                 microphysical processes in mesoscale snowbands.  Additionally, an               advanced radar technique, termed differential reflectivity                      measurements, will be used in conjunction with in situ aircraft                 measurements in diagnostic studies of the storm's microphysics                  and to determine the utility of remote sensing of winter storm                  microphysical characteristics including the location of                         supercooled liquid water.",
