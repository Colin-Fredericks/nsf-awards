 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight women will be involved in field and laboratory                       research to determine the origin of glacial and postglacial                     deposits in west-central Minnesota.  This includes the                          continuation of three closely related projects which have in                    common the utilization of till provenance analysis to determine                 the origin and glacial history of three problematic deposits.                   These deposits are, 1) the Alexandria Moraine Complex, 2) Tunnel                Valley Eskers, and 3) the striated and faceted Boulder Pavement                 of the Minnesota River Valley.  Additionally, paleoenvironmental                studies of late- and postglacial deposits will be expanded and                  will include micropaleontological, palynological and geochemical                investigations of lake and bog sediments.  The 1991 program will                include analysis of a postglacial lake/bog deposit which contains               the remains of at least four Bison spp. and other lake and bog                  sediments in the area.                                                               U.M.M., an undergraduate institution, offers excellent                     facilities and close faculty contact.  R.E.U. women will have the               opportunity to develop collegial ties with other undergraduates                 doing geologic research and to serve as mentors, instructors and                role models to underrepresented high school students                            participating in college level research.  The research                          experience and the unique opportunity to interact with a                        scientific community where underrepresented individuals are in                  the majority will both break down a number of traditional                       barriers and aid in the maturation of these students as                         scientists.  The culmination to the program, the \"Friends of UMM                REU\" conference, will provide these women with the opportunity to               present results and discuss ideas with experts in the field.                    Additionally a field present results and discuss ideas with                     experts in the field. Additionally a field trip to the Canadian                 Rockies will show participants active glacial processes and                     glacial environments. The REU program will contribute to the                    personal growth of these women and the research to be                           accomplished will contribute to the understanding of the glacial                history of Minnesota.",
