 "awd_abstract_narration": "The existing Industrial Robotics Laboratory provides                            undergraduate students in three required courses and six                        technical elective courses with adequate educational                            demonstrations and experiments.  The focus has been on the                      basic principles of industrial robotic technology.  The                         workstation augmentation will permit enhancement of the                         laboratory experience through addition of topics such as                        concurrent engineering design of robotic solutions, integration                 of robotic devices in Computer Integrated Manufacturing                         systems, off-line task level and application oriented                           programming, and computer- aided design of essential robotic                    applications that are difficult to include in a university lab,                 such as welding and painting.  The equipment used includes a                    color graphic work-station with an integrated CAD software                      package for robotic work-cell design, kinematic, dynamic and                    graphic simulation, and off-line task programming.",
