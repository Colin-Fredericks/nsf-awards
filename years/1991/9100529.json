 "awd_abstract_narration": "An eight-week program of Research Experience for                           Undergraduates will be supported by this award. Ten students will               work on a combination of individual projects. There will be enough              faculty participating so that each student may be paired with an                individual advisor. There will also be ample opportunity for                    interaction and discussion among the students themselves. The                   principal investigators are also planning a cooperative effort with             Oak Ridge National Laboratory which will give students the                      opportunity to work at the laboratory on problems of interest to                mathematicians.  This will place extensive computer facilities at               the disposal of the students at no extra cost.                                       There are a large number of sample projects scheduled for the              program. The students will work on numerical algorithms which                   involve parallel processing, modeling of heat and mass transfer                 processes, and factorization properties of integral domains. They               will also study maximum principles for elliptic systems and the                 classification of knots. The number of topics should help the                   students appreciate the variety of problems which are of interest               to mathematical scientists.",
