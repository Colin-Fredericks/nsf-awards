 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project nwill investigate how language minority                            students appropriate new forms of scientific sense-making                       through their participation in collaborative scientific                         inquiry in biology (e.g., ethology, botany, ecology,                            embryology).  The investigation will be anchored in a                           description of the forms of scientic understanding                              that Haitian students in grades 5-8 develop and an anlysis                      of how these emerging forms are socially constructed in                         classroom settings.  In the framework of this project,                          understanding encompasses:  conceptual knowledge in biology,                    scientific sense-making practices, and epistemological                          beliefs about science.  The proposed work encompasses                           development of research instruments to probe the various                        dimensions of students scientic understanding, direct work                      with bilingual classroom teachers to enhance their                              competence to teach science as collaborative inquiry,                           developmental research with children to determine  how their                    scientific understanding changes overtime, and ethnographic                     research in classrooms to analyze how students scientific                       understanding is socially constructed.                                                                                                                          Through empirical study of the ways in which scientific                         understanding is socially constructed, this research will                       provide both a theoretical rationale and practical model for                    building sense-making communities in the science slassroom.                     It will characterize specific sense-making practices which                      engender the development of scientific understanding in                         language minority students.  In addition, through its focus                     on biology, it will contribute to an emerging knowledge base                    on conceptual change in biology.//",
