 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program supports the continued work of Dr. Edward Rosenberg of                  the Chemistry Department, California State University at                        Northridge, for the investigation of the role of ligand                         mobility in metal cluster reactions.  In particular, Rosenberg                  will study the transfer of hydrogen between oxygen or nitrogen                  and metal carbonyl cluster systems and investigate the source                   of the kinetic isotope effect previously observed for this                      reaction.  He will also study substitution and addition                         reactions of some osmium and ruthenium clusters containing                      face-capping nitrogen ligands in order to elucidate the role of                 stereochemical nonrigidity in this reaction.  These studies                     will potentially provide new insights into the mechanism of                     activation by metal surfaces in catalysis.                                                                                                                      One mechanism for protonation consistent with the observed                      kinetic isotope effect is proton tunneling, but an alternative                  mechanism is intermolecular transfer.  Low temperature                          protonation reactions of ruthenium carbonyls by deuterated acid                 will be studied in order to determine the extent to which                       proton transfer is intra- or intermolecular.  In related work,                  a series of dinuclear rhenium compounds will be studied to see                  if cluster fluxionality can result in a symmetrical hydrogen                    transfer intermediate, a usual requirement for proton                           tunneling.  For the stereochemical nonrigidity studies, a                       trinuclear ruthenium cluster will be reacted with diazomethane                  and its deuterated analog to investigate the unexpected room                    temperature oxidative addition of CH in this reaction and the                   involvement, if any, of the bridging hydride.",
