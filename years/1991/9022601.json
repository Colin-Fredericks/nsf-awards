This research tests a theory of social control of deviance,                                                                                                the ways in which individuals can influence others not to commit                                                                                                deviant acts.  How people respond to sanctions varies greatly                   depending on group context.  For instance, community norms                      reinforce and support laws, preventing more cases of deviance                   than are prevented by the legal sanctions such as prison.                       Alternatively, peer pressure can contravene laws, as when college                                                                                               students support each others' drinking, or output norms restrict                                                                                                productivity.  The theory under test here includes both actual                  and perceived strength of sanctions, the cost of individual                     compliance, the cost and effectiveness of trying to get others to                                                                                               comply or not to comply, and the perceived likelihood that                      deviance will be detected.  Experiments constitute direct tests                 of most of the theory's assertions.  Results will help develop                  this explicit theory on the operation of social control proces-                 ses, and will have applications in law enforcement and informal                 control situations.",
