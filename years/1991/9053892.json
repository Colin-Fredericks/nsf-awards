 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a model for the teaching of                     science and mathematics with the specific objective of                          recruiting and retaining more women in science and                              technological careers. Research findings from Women's Studies                   are being utilized in designing, implementing, evaluating and                   disseminating the model. Since the project involves                             collaboration by thescience/math faculty of the nine campuses                   of the University of South Carolina System, ranging from                        two-year campuses to a major graduate/research campus, the                      model should be suitable for adaptation and national                            dissemination to a wide variety of institutions. Twenty-five                    science/math faculty drawn from 5 two-year, 3 four-year and                     one graduate/research campus areparticipating in the project.                   Activities take place in two settings and formats: two                          on-site, two-day workshops at each of the nine campuses for                     individualized design, and implementation of the model; and,                    three, two-day plenary workshops for intercampus exchange,                      expert consulting, contrastive analysis, and synthesis of the                   most successful strategies.                                                     Measurable Objectives to determine project effectiveness                        include:                                                                                                                                                             o Evidence of positively changed pedagogy and                                     perceptions regarding gender by participating faculty                           (as demonstrated on pre- and post-project surveys).                                                                                                           o A statistically significant increase (when compared                             with baseline figures and the control group) of the                             number and proportion of women entering the science                             and math courses affected by this transformational                              project, the number going on to additional science and                          math courses, and the number opting for graduate and                            post-graduate careers in science or math (as                                    determined by long term tracking).                                                                                                                            o A net improvement in faculty perceptions of the value                           of inter-campus and inter-level communication (as                               demonstrated on pre- and post-project surveys).",
