 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metals entering streams in association with milling waste                  particles and spoil leachates have produced toxic concentrations                of arsenic, cadmium, lead, and zinc in fluvial deposits.  To                    understand metal transport dynamics in streams requires the                     integration of knowledge from several disciplines, including                    geomorphology, sedimentology, and geochemistry.  The complexity                 of such integration helps explain why few investigators have                    attempted to describe metal dispersion in terms of the                          sedimentary units in which they are stored.  This doctoral                      dissertation research project will focus on determination of the                physical and geochemical controls on the distribution of trace                  metal storage in fluvial sediments in the Upper Mississippi                     Zinc-Lead District.  The research will describe the spatial                     patterns of metal storage by (1) mapping of surface and                         subsurface floodplain and channel deposits; (2) analyzing total                 metal concentration, particle size and mineralogic composition;                 and (3) identifying sediment-meal phase relationships.                          A goal of the project is development of a model that                            characterizes the interaction of watershed sediment and metal                   pollutant budgets.                                                                                                                                                   This project will contribute to a better understanding of                  the geomorphic and geochemical factors that determine the                       distribution and residence times of metal storages in mined                     watersheds.  It will increase our understanding of the effects of               nonpoint pollution sources on long-term water quality problems                  and the use of geochemical tracers in environmental-based                       studies.  This project also will provide an excellent opportunity               for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent                research skills.",
