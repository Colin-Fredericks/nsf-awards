 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective immobilization of homogeneous catalysts is                            technologically important for the petrochemical and fine-                       chemical industries.  This work addresses techniques for                        catalyst immobilization that are applicable both to large-                      scale and to small-scale production.  The use of supported                      aqueous-phase (SAP) catalysts has already been shown to be                      effective for hydroformylation of a variety of olefins.  The                    present work examines the unique properties of SAP catalysts                    using physicochemical approaches, in particular the role of                     water in the determination of catalytic activity.  The SAP                      concept is also extended to catalytic oxidations.                               Additionally, other immobilization techniques are explored,                     including ion-exchange resins as a means to immobilize                          catalysts with functionalized ligands, and the use of very                      large, but soluble, ligands combined with membrane separation                   technology.                                                                                                                                                     Many homogeneous (soluble) catalysts are known to facilitate                    chemical transformations with high selectivity under mild                       conditions, but their commercial use is inhibited by the high                   cost of separating the products from the solution containing                    the catalyst and the fact that reusing the catalyst is often                    difficult if not impossible.  Immobilization techniques offer                   the prospect of circumventing these problems by making the                      homogeneous catalysts behave more like heterogeneous                            catalysts.  Accomplishing this while preserving the desirable                   catalytic properties has proven to be difficult, but the                        benefit in potential new processes would be enormous.",
