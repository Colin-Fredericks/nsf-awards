 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thrust of the project is to develop an algorithm to                         partition an unstable standard polytope of polynomials                          into stable and unstable regions.  This will be an                              extension of the Principal Investigator's work for the                          partition of unstable polygons of polynomials (convex                           hull of finitely many coplanar polynomials).  Since the                         strong theoretical foundation for the resolution of this                        problem has already been laid in the Principal                                  Investigator's earlier work, a reasonable solution of the                       partition problem for polytopes looks quite promising.                          It is also proposed that the partition approach has                             several useful practical applications.  For example, this                       approach could be utilized to find a controller that                            would stabilize a given uncertain plant with affine                             coefficients in the parameters over a certain compact                           domain of its uncertainty.  The concept of Youla's                              parameterization of all stabilizing controllers for a                           nominal plant is utilized to achieve this end.  Another                         potential application is to obtain maximal robustness                           bounds for the parameters involved in the characteristic                        polynomial of a control system when the coefficients                            are affinely dependent on the parameter vector.  A                              possible approach for this is to partition the unstable                         polytope generated by the characteristic polynomials                            and identify the maximal domain of parameter vector                             by identifying the values of the parameter vector                               corresponding to the boundary of the partition.",
