 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective is to understand in chemical-mechanical terms how                 ribosomes and the macromolecules that interact with them form                   proteins.  The primary objective is to monitor and describe the                 extension of a nascent peptide as it is extended by the stepwise                addition of amino acids at the ribosomal peptidyl transferase                   center.  particular attention will be given to the question  of                 whether the nascent peptide is channeled from the peptidyl                      transferase to the exit domain through a tunnel that transversed                the large ribosomal subunit, and if so, to determine how the                    nascent peptide is inserted into the tunnel.  Secondary objective               are to determine when the mRNA moves through the ribosome during                the reaction step of peptide elongation and to further analyze                  how antibiotics such as erythromycin and chloromphenical inhibit                protein synthesis.  The approach is to covalently attack                        fluorophores at specific sites on the tRNA, mRNA ribosomal                      proteins, and ribosomal RMA, then to use fluorescence techniques                to monitor changes in the position and conformation of the                      components that occur during the specific reaction steps of                     protein synthesis.  The results are anticipated to be directly                  relevant to the in vitro synthesis of artificial enzymes by                     biotechnological procedures and to the control of protein                       synthesis in certain pathologies.",
