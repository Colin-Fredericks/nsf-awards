 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Creager, a trained biochemist, is entering a postdoctoral                   training and research program at the History of Science Department              of Harvard University.  Working with Professor Everett Mendelsohn,              she is investigating two questions relating to the emergence of                 molecular biology in this century.  First, how did the preexisting              program of research on proteins contribute to the ascension of                  molecular biology and how was that program changed by it?                       Physiologists and biochemists appropriated experimental methodology             from the physical sciences before molecular biologists exploited                this approach to answer fundamental questions in genetics.  Dr.                 Creager is examining the development of this physico-chemical                   approach at the Physical Chemistry Laboratory at Harvard Medical                School in the first decades of this century.  Second, she is asking             is the concept of the molecular biological revolution of the life               sciences a suitable or accurate expression of the nature of                     scientific change in biology in this century.  She is studying the              relationship of molecular biology to the older field of                         biochemistry in order to assess whether molecular biology                       introduced a novel methodology or approach.  Her investigations of              whether developments in the life sciences in this century have been             continuous or discontinuous with previous traditions should provide             a basis for assessing the nature of scientific change in modern                 biology.",
