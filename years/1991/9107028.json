 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gunnison's prairie dogs (Cynomys gunnisoni) formerly were                  an important part of the ecosystem of the western United States,                serving as common prey for golden eagles, peregrine falcons,                    coyotes, bobcats, badgers, and black-footed ferrets.  Shooting                  and poisoning brought these animals to the brink of extinction in               the early 1970's.  Little is known about their reproductive and                 population biology.  The proposed research will examine the                     natural history and population biology of Gunnison's prairie dogs               living under natural conditions at Petrified Forest National Park               in Arizona.                                                                          Inbreeding usually produces inferior offspring.  Like other                animals, Gunnison's prairie dogs avoid extreme inbreeding with                  relatives such as parents, offspring, and siblings.  Do they also               avoid mating with more distant kin such as first and second                     cousins?  By directly observing copulations of individuals of                   known genealogies, the frequency of moderate inbreeding among                   Gunnison's prairie dogs and whether such inbreeding yields                      inferior offspring will be identified.                                               Communal nursing, the suckling of another female's                         offspring, is rare among mammals living under natural conditions.               Trying to understand apparent cases of altruism such as communal                nursing poses one of the greatest challenges to evolutionary and                behavioral ecologists.  Communal nursing among Gunnison's prairie               dogs occurs in three different contexts, and affects more than                  10% of all juveniles.  The proximate and ultimate causes for this               high frequency of communal nursing will also be investigated.",
