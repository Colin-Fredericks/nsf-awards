 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the central importance of law in legitimating colonialism,              there has been only limited work on the role of law in the                      colonization process.  This project examines processes of                       domination and resistance surrounding the imposition of American                law during the colonization of Hawaii in the nineteenth and                     twentieth centuries.  Colonialism is conceptualized as a struggle               among the interests of various foreign groups and those of                      indigenous peoples.  The struggle, located in the courts as well                as in the schools, the market, the churches, and the institutions               of government, will be analyzed in the context of the culture and               politics of the colonizer and the colonized.  The project includes              a comparison of New England lower courts to provide a contrast in               which cultural patterns are more similar and in which there is no               colonial heritage.  The analysis will examine differences between               Hawaii and New England, searching for the implications of the                   historical use of law as a mode of discipline and control by the                colonial government and the extent to which present patterns of                 court law and forms of legal consciousness are the legacy of                    Hawaii's historical experiences with colonialism.                                                                                                               This research promises to advance our understanding of legal                    pluralism as a dynamic process.  In particular, the study should                illuminate the ways in which indigenous and imposed legal cultures              interact and transform one another and the relative influence of                coercion, ideology, and example in that process.  Also, the project             should contribute to the analysis of culture as a series of                     competing discourses or contradictory elements rather than an                   integrated or continuous entity.  Finally, since Hawaii posed a                 continuing problem for the United States because it was both                    strategically valuable but culturally and racially different, this              study will provide an opportunity to explore the colonial discourse             of race, identity, cultural diversity, and law in the United                    States.",
