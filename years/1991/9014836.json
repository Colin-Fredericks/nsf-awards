 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Wayne Mattice of the University of Akron and Dr. Donald                         Napper of the University of Sidney.  Polymer colloids are                       important industrial materials. They must be stabilized                         against coagulation to be effective. Steric stabilization,                      using block copolymers, is one means of suppressing coagu-                      lation. If the block copolymer is to be effective in steric                     stabilization, the anchoring block must bind tightly to the                     colloidal particle. One objective of this collaboration is to                   develop the new technology of Macromolecular Modeling so that                   it can provide insight into the local structure of the                          anchoring block in the immediate vicinity of the colloidal                      particle. An additional requirement for a block copolymer                       that will be effective in steric stabilization is that the                      stabilizing block must interact repulsively with both the                       anchoring block and the colloidal particle, and interact                        attractively with the dispersion medium (solvent). The second                   objective of the collaboration is to develop Macromolecular                     Modeling of the structure in the immediate vicinity of the                      junction between the anchoring block and the stabilizing                        block. It is in the vicinity of the junction that the                           interaction of the copolymer with the solvent changes from                      repulsive to attractive.                                                                                                                                        The project represents excellent collaboration between Dr.                      Napper, with his broad knowledge of the properties of                           sterically stabilized polymer colloids and Dr. Mattice's                        expertise in block polymers. The research represents a                          coordinated approach to make an important contribution to                       improved understanding of the interaction of anchoring and                      stabilizing blocks against coagulation in polymer colloids,                     an important industrial material.",
