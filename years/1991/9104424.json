 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a joint seminar between US and                          French mathematicians on the topic of the transfer of                           mathematics to industry in the US and France. The seminar                       will be held at the Institute for Mathematics and its                           Applications (IMA), University of Minnesota, in October                         1991.  The US organizers are Drs. Avner Friedman and Willard                    Miller of the IMA.  The co-sponsoring organization is the                       French National Institute for Computer Science and Automation                   (INRIA), Roquencourt, France.                                                                                                                                   Both the IMA and INRIA have extensive contacts with industry.                   The IMA has recently initiated a program \"Postdoctorates in                     Industrial Mathematics\" and the annual and summer programs                      at the IMA also bring in large number of visitors from                          industry.  A different experience of contact with industry                      is going on at INRIA, which has a long tradition of                             multidisciplinary research, mixing computer science  and                        applied mathematics (control and scientific computing).                         This research is done in cooperation with various industries,                   such as Dassault, Aerospaciale, Peugot and Electricite de                       France.  It is largely performed in common projects,                            involving INRIA researchers, engineers from industry and PHD                    students, most of whom are later recruited by industry.  In                     addition, INRIA organizes many seminars, symposia and                           advanced courses aimed at transferring new ideas and                            techniques to industry.  The proposed seminar is the result                     of a decision by IMA and INRIA to bring together key                            individuals from universities and industry, who are playing                     roles in building bridges between the two communities.  The                     goals of the seminar are:  1) to facilitate transfer of                         mathematical problems of present interest to industry, and                      mathematical knowledge applicable to industry, 2) to outline                    future mathematical research directions in industry, and 3)                     to discuss the best methods of educating mathematics                            graduate students to be successful in industry, while doing                     good mathematics.",
