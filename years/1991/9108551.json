 "awd_abstract_narration": "Standard models of auctions need enrichment in order to be applied              in realistic contexts.  Many common but neglected factors                       invalidate the advice that current auction theory offers to bid-                takers and to bidders.  This research will augment bidding theory               in several realistic directions and isolate sources of divergence               between theoretical predictions and laboratory observations.  One               thrust of the research replaces the usual assumption of a fixed                 number of bidders with endogeneous determination of bidder                      participation based upon the probability of competing.  We indicate             when the usual revenue comparisons are confirmed and when they are              reversed.  Another thrust will include several realistic models of              cheating and rule bending in auction models.  One model allows                  bidders to submit multiple bids and withdraw a `winning' bid when               it is advantageous to do so.  A third thrust will examine various               formats for the sequential or simultaneous sale of multiple assets              examining how auction form may influence bidders' strategies and                the values of the assets.  A fourth thrust examines information                 flows between bidders during the course of an English auction and               how those flows affect strategies and the values of the assets.                 A fifth thrust reconsiders the standard assumption of symmetric                 bidders to see which comparative static predictions are robust to               asymmetries.",
