 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                           Organometallic Chemistry Program in support of the research of                  Craig L. Hill at Emory University. The award provides continued                 support for Hill's research on hydrocarbon oxidation catalyzed                  by transition metal polyoxometallates. Both thermal and                         photochemical systems will be studied. The work will address                    fundamental problems in the activation and transfer of oxygen                   from metal centers to C-H bonds and other areas of relevance to                 both industrial and biological systems.                                                                                                                         The objectives of the research are: (1) to establish the                        factors which control product selectivity, catalyst stability,                  and key mechanistic features in sustained oxo transfer to                       alkanes catalyzed by homogeneous, very active and stable,                       oxidatively-resistant inorganic metalloporphyrin analogues                      (IMAs), (2) to develop chiral IMAs that will catalyze                           asymmetric hydroxylation of alkanes, (3) to delineate the                       factors that affect the quantum yields of competing                             polyoxometallate excited state decay processes and the                          selectivities and turnover rates in hydrocarbon photooxidation,                 (4) to convert unactivated C-H bonds into carbonium ions for                    useful reactions including the catalytic production of                          monofluorinated hydrocarbons directly from hydrocarbons and                     fluoride ion, and (5) to rigorously establish the structural,                   spectroscopic and photochemical properties of                                   polyperoxo(oxo)tungstates that have potential for use as                        negative inorganic photoresists for microlithography and as                     selective oxidants for olefins.",
