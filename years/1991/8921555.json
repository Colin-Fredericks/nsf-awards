This workshop would bring                    together mathematicians actively involved in the study of                       homological properties of finite dimensional algebras, aiming                   toward amalgamations of the new techniques which have recently                  led to progress on several longstanding problems.  The main focus               of the workshop would be the Finitistic Dimension Conjecture and                its ramifications, including the Nakayama Conjecture.  It is                    anticipated that the ideas developed during this meeting will                   benefit the area of finite dimensional algebra as a whole. The                  workshop would be attended by about 30 participants, including 2-               3 graduate students.  Invited speakers would include D. Anick, M.               Auslander, K. Fuller, K. Igusa, E. Kirkman, J. Kuzmanovich, I.                  Reiten and D. Zacharia, as well as the organizers, E. Green and                 B. Zimmermann-Huisgen.",
