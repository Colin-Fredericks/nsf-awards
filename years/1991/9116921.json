 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Earle and his                     collaborators will conduct preliminary archaeological survey and                excavation on the Thy peninsula which is located in northeastern                Jutland, Denmark.  While the region is known to be rich in                      archaeological remains, only limited excavation has been                        conducted and in the course of one season of fieldwork, Dr. Earle               and his team will evaluate survey and excavation techniques which               will form the basis for a larger long-term project.  The Thy                    region contains large numbers of barrows or burial chambers and                 most knowledge about the Neolithic and Bronze age derive from                   these.  However, much less is known about the settlements in                    which people lived.  Because such settlements are marked by                     relatively few remains they are difficult to locate.  When                      ceramics and lithic remains are discovered on the surface, it is                hard to tell whether they are markers of intact deposits which                  merit excavation.  The Thy region has been farmed for thousands                 of years and quite possibly repeated farming has destroyed                      subsurface features.  Dr. Earle and his team will evaluate                      different survey techniques which are routinely used in the                     United States and apply them to the more intensively utilized                   Danish landscape.  In areas with significant scatters of surface                remains he will conduct test excavations to determine the                       relationship between surface and subsurface remains. On this                    basis he will assess the feasibility  of a larger scale long term               project.                                                                                                                                                        Following the development of agriculture and pastoralism in many                parts of the world, one can trace changes in social organization                which lead, ultimately, to the rise of states.  Early in this                   process, chiefdoms arose and anthropologists still do not                       understand the mechanisms through which this happened.  Some                    argue that population growth, permitted by a more stable                        subsistence base, provided the driving force while others point                 to other factors such as the development of long distance trade.                Over the course of the Bronze and Iron Ages in Scandinavia,                     chiefdoms underwent cycles of rise and decline.  The data                       collected from this area will allow comparison with cases from                  other parts of the world.  From this, it should be possible to                  separate historical particulars from the more basic underlying                  mechanisms.                                                                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to many archaeologists.  It will test and help                 to develop survey techniques which may be applicable in many                    parts of the world and will provide the foundation for a longer                 term large scale project.",
