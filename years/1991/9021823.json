 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to North               Dakota State University for the renovation and repair of two                    adjoining buildings, Ladd Hall and Dunbar Laboratories, which                   house that institution's chemical research and research training                activities.  These buildings were constructed, respectively, in                 1913 and 1963, and last renovated in 1979.  The ARFMP grant of                  $600,000 and $600,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will              be used to modernize these research and research training                       facilities and to foster greater interactions by locating related               research laboratories in close proximity to one another.  This                  project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure by providing an upgraded heating, ventilation, and               air-conditioning (HVAC) system and by rehabilitating basement                   research and research training space  to accomodamodate two laser               laboratories.                                                                                                                                                   This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.                Students trained in these laboratories have the benefit of having               been educated in consistently productive programs, including the                North Dakota State University's unique program in polymers and                  coatings.",
