 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemical character of complexes between organic hosts and                   guests will be studied.  The research will focus on the                         incarceration of guests in rigidly hollow hosts either without                  holes (carcerands) or with holes (hemicarcerands) in their                      shells.  The free energies of constrictive binding by                           hemicarceplexes will be measured for both aliphatic and                         aromatic guests in the molecular weight range of about 80-120.                  The rates of complexation and decomplexation will be correlated                 with the relative sizes of the guests and portals in                            hemicarceplexes.  Comparisons will be made between the rates                    and products of reactions run in the interior phases of                         dissolved demicarceplexes, and those run in the same solvents                   free of the hosts.  Guests will be designed, prepared, and                      studied, only a part of which can be incarcerated, the rest                     being too large to pass through the portals of the hosts.  A                    small molecular tether will connect the two parts.  Other                       guests will be studied, one part of which will be contained in                  one hemicarcerand and a second part in a second hemicarcerand.                  The product will be two hemicarceplexes connected by a short                    molecular tether.  New families of carcerands and                               hemicarcerands will be designed and synthesized.                                                                                                                The Organic Synthesis Program is funding the renewal of this                    Nobel Prize research.  It will continue its development of the                  chemistry of small molecules imprisoned inside larger                           molecules.  The work has the potential to lead to very unique                   new patterns of reactivity.",
