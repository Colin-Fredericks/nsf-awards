 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. R. W. Carpenter, Director of the                        Center for Solid State Science, Arizona State University                        (ASU), to link the work of his research group in two related                    lines of materials science with two outstanding German                          research groups, the ceramics research laboratory of the                        German Aerospace Research Establishment (DFVLR), headed by                      Dr. Wolfgang Braue, and a group headed by Dr. Hannes Lichte                     of the University of Tubingen.  With DFVLR, the ASU group                       will investigate the relationships among structures and                         properties and processing in structural ceramics.  With Dr.                     Lichte, they will pursue a direct experimental investigation                    of conventional and holographic high resolution electron                        imaging of crystal lattice defects in specimens important for                   materials science.  In both projects common specimens will be                   used for particular parts of each project.                                                                                                                      It is well known and central to materials science that the                      microstructure of all material objects such as structural                       ceramics or solid state electronic materials is quite                           dependent on the synthesis process.  Arizona State University                   has novel and uncommon capabilities for analyzing the                           geometry of microstructures.  DFVLR has unusual capabilities                    for processing and analyzing and measuring the properties of                    ceramics from starting materials through finished structural                    materials.  This unique array of capabilities at the two                        cooperating laboratories enables detailed and controlled                        study of microstructural properties and their relationship to                   processing in this important class of structural materials.                                                                                                     Collaboration with the group at the University of Tubingen                      focuses on the need to obtain better spatial resolution in                      the imaging of defects in crystal lattices to advance the                       frontiers of materials science research.   Lattice defects,                     or interruptions in the periodicity of crystals, such as                        grain boundaries and interfaces, have major influences on the                   properties of materials.  These are not easily predicted from                   theory, and experimental data are badly needed.  The University                 of Tubingen possesses capability for electron holographic                       high resolution imaging.  However, the apparently greatly                       enhanced data on lattice defects obtained by this new                           experimental method must be interpreted and compared to the                     most closely related data obtainable by existing and reliable                   methods.  ASU possesses state of the art conventional high                      resolution electron microscopes that can be used for this                       purpose.",
