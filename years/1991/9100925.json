 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the first half of the Cenozoic, members of the order                        Creodonta were the predominant terrestrial carnivores in North                  America, Eurasia, and Africa.  Creodonts exploited many of the                  same adaptive zones as later members of the Carnivora and                       Marsupialia, and they exhibit many of the same morphologies.                    Although they had a wide distribution and great ecologic                        importance, the phylogeny and major locomotory and feeding                      adaptations of creodonts remain largely unstudied.                                                                                                              This study will be the first comprehensive assessment of creodont               phylogeny and evolution in the context of phylogenetic                          systematics.  It will address the questions of creodont                         monophyly, their relationship to the Carnivora, their                           phylogenetic position within Eutheria, and the position of                      several problematic taxa within Creodonta.  Furthermore, this                   phylogenetic information will be used to examine the origin of                  morphologies convergent with those seen in other carnivorous                    mammals.  Creodonts had three relatively separate radiations.                   These, along with the radiations of Carnivora and carnivorous                   marsupials, provide an excellent chance to look at the phenomena                of convergent evolution and community structure in terrestrial                  ecosystems of the Tertiary.                                                                                                                                     Data will come from original analysis of museum specimens and                   from the published literature.  In the phylogenetic analysis                    dental, cranial, postcranial, and inferred anatomical characters                will be used.",
