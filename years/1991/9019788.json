 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is intense competition for nutrients between                         understory vegetation and trees in forest ecosystems.  Yet, there               has been a notable lack of mechanistic analyses of belowground                  resource competition and the development of competition-induced                 resource partitioning in plant communities.  This research will                 quantitatively evaluate belowground competition for nutrients.                  Mycorrhizal fungi will affect the competitive exploitation of                   soil resources by plants, Despite the importance of external                    hyphae to the function of mycorrhizae, few researchers have                     attempted to quantify their distribution.                                            The objectives of this research are (i) to determine the                   small-scale spatial patterns of roots and hyphae of mycorrhizal                 fungi and assess their significance in regards to overlapping                   depletion zones and nutrient uptake and (ii) to examine the                     effects of understory roots and mycorrhizae on the seasonal and                 annual pattern of pine-root growth and nutrient uptake.  The                    research will evaluate the field distribution of roots in species               mixtures and monocultures.  Under controlled environmental                      conditions, competition between external hyphae of                              ectomycorrhizal pine roots and external hyphae of vesicular-                    arbuscular mycorrhizal grass roots will be examined.  Mass                      flow/diffusion supply models will be used to elucidate how                      patterns of root and mycorrhiza growth affect nutrient                          competition.  The project will contribute basic ecological                      concepts which maybe infertile soils.",
