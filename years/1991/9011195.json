 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this continuing award is to further investigate                  the relationship between research and development and economic                  growth.  Earlier work on R&D at the level of the firm found a                   high private of rate of return to R&D, especially to its                        privately financed and basic research components.  This earlier                 work was undertaken by the principal investigator and others                    looking at data for the U.S., France, and Japan.  The research to               be undertaken in this project will extend the international                     comparative analysis to incorporate parallel data sets on                       industrial R&D for Israel and Norway.  A comparison of the impact               of R&D at the level of the firm and at the more aggregated                      industry level will be undertaken in an effort to measure the                   discrepancy between the private and social returns to R&D.  The                 main output of the project will be a volume tentatively entitled                \" R&D and Economic Growth\".  Besides summarizing the previous                   work on this topic, it will review the methodology involved in                  estimating rates of return from R&D, survey the work of other                   researchers on the same and related topics, integrate the                       results, and evaluate policy conclusions that emerge from the                   analysis.",
