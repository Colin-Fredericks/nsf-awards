 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research at Undergraduate Institution grant is awarded for                 theoretical research on surface reconstruction.  Surface                        reconstruction refers to the spontaneous rearrangement of atoms                 that occurs in the surface atomic layers of some materials.  These              rearrangements are of interest sine they represent important                    opportunities to compare theoretical treatments of surface                      energetics and experimental probes of the structure of surface                  layers.  Reconstructive surfaces present much more stringent tests              of scientific methods than do static surfaces.  Two specific                    systems will be investigated.  The (110) surface of gold will be                studied where through surface diffusion a reconstructed surface                 with missing rows of gold is formed.  The Embedded Atom Method and              Monte Carlo techniques will be used to study the energetics.  The               (001) surface of tungsten in which each atom is displaced slightly              from its equilibrium position in an alternating pattern will also               be studied.  In this case the energetics related to the surface                 phase diagram will be examined.                                                 %%%                                                                             The collective properties of atoms on the surfaces of solids are                different than those in the bulk due to the absence of other atoms              beyond the surface layer.  The energetics of surface atoms are thus             different than those in the bulk.  One of the consequences of this              difference in energetics is that the surface atoms can arrange                  themselves differently than the bulk.  These rearranged atoms can               result in the surface layer having different physical properties                than the bulk solid.  For instance, certain surface structures are              better than others for catalysis.  The proposed research will study             two classes of surface reconstruction in two model systems.  The                results will help to understand why specific surface structures are             formed in these materials.",
