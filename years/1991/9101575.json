 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main purpose of this research project is to study the                  topology and geometry of low and higher dimensional manifolds.                  Particular attention will be paid to symmetries of manifolds.                   The problems which will be studied cover a large spectrum of                    questions, ranging from very specific problems concerning low-                  dimensional manifolds to general problems concerning the geometry               of positively curved higher dimensional manifolds.  The main                    techniques which will be employed in this research include: gauge               theory, surgery, homotopy theory, transformation groups and                     differential geometry.                                                               Manifolds are very natural objects to study.  They are the                 spaces which are locally like Euclidean spaces.  For example, the               space in which we live (ignoring time), has three dimensions,                   making it a three-dimensional manifold, locally, but not                        necessarily globally, like Euclidean three-space.  Taking time                  into account, physical space becomes a four-dimensional manifold.               Whether it is globally Euclidean four-space or some other,                      possibly bounded, four-dimensional manifold is a deep question of               cosmology.  Answering this question is not a matter for                         mathematics alone, but exploring the various possibilities is an                important and properly mathematical matter.",
