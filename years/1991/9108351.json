 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to examine how the rationality of                economic agents and equilibria in games evolve over time through                repeated interaction of bounded-rational players.  The basic idea               is that players do not solve a complicated problem of finding                   optimal strategies by introspection, but rather they try to solve               it by trial and error.  Rather than determining players' behavior               by an equilibrium, some simple but plausible behavioral assumptions             are adopted, and whether the process converges to an equilibrium                is examined.                                                                                                                                                    The evolution of equilibria in a society where a finite number of               players are randomly matched to play a game will be investigated.               Relatively unsuccessful strategies are abandoned over time, and                 occasionally new strategies are introduced by new entrants                      (\"mutations\").  While most of the literature on this subject                    examines the local stability of equilibria with respect to a few                one-shot mutations, the long-run, global behavior of the system                 subject to a series of random mutations will be studied here.  A                new technique is introduced to analyze the long run distribution                of strategies when the mutation rate is vanishingly small, and it               is shown that this approach can drastically reduce the set of                   equilibria.  Also, the evolution of pre-play communication will be              re-examined in this framework.                                                                                                                                  Game theory has become one of the most fundamental analytical tools             in economics and related social sciences.  The core of game                     theoretic analysis is the Nash equilibrium concept.  Although                   widely used, its logical foundations are rather shaky: Namely, we               do not have satisfactory answers to the following fundamental                   questions.  How do players come to play a Nash equilibrium, and,                if there are many Nash equilibria, which one is chosen?  This                   project will answer those questions in a certain class of                       situations, where rationality and equilibrium evolve over time                  through repeated interaction of players.",
