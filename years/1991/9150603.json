 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops an honors introductory two-semester                       calculus-based physics sequence which goes beyond the narrow                    problem-solving focus of the standard sequence, and directs a                   considerable amount of attention to the historical context in                   which major physical concepts originated and developed.  This                   helps students to internalize these concepts, develop the                       ability to apply them, and recognize their place in science and                 modern thought.  Such a pedagogical approach enhances                           understanding and captures the interest of honors students,                     thus making them aware of the challenge and excitement of                       physics as an intellectual discipline and career.  These                        students represent a small but previously untapped high ability                 pool of potential physics majors having a high percentage of                    women.  Subject matter is organized about the following major                   themes:  particle motion and the structure of the universe;                     waves and the transmission of energy; thermodynamics,                           statistics and the gross structure of matter; electromagnetism                  and field concepts; relativity, quantum theory, and models of                   the microscopic and ultimate structure of matter.",
