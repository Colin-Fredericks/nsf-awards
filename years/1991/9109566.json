 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines the impact of computers on job stress and                   quality of working life.  The main characteristic of the                        conceptual model in this study is that stress effects are                       determined by a combination of technology and job                               characteristics.  The way work is organized and jobs are                        structured plays an important role in the relation between                      computer technology and job stress.  The research model is tested               with a population of office work (clerical workers and                          professionals) using various computer technology from one public                service organization.  The research uses multiple data collection               methods (questionnaire, interviews and log-in's), multiple                      sources of information (employees, supervisors, information                     systems personnel), and multiple times of data-collection (2                    times separated by one year).  The longitudinal design will allow               testing of the time-lagged and cumulative effects of computer                   technology on job stress, and the study of \"natural\" changes in                 computer technology characteristics.  A four-week diary is                      conducted to measure computer technology characteristics and mood               states and to examine the relationships between these variables,                and job design and other measures of job stress.  This focused                  study of the use of computers by office workers in one                          organization can increase our theoretical knowledge about the                   impact of computer use on job stress and quality of working life.",
