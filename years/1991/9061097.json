 "awd_abstract_narration": "Time-temperature modeling of organic matter maturation has                 become an important tool in petroleum an gas exploration in                     recent years.  The most serious difficulties in applying these                  models are:  1)obtaining accurate downhole geological                           information, and 2)estimation of kinetic parameters.  Single                    collective kinetic rates are typically measured in the                          laboratory.  These must then be applied on much longer geological               time scales.  The validity of making these extrapolations in time               is always questionable.  The innovation offered in this proposal                is the development of a combined theoretical and experimental                   methodology for determining the chemistry and kinetics of the                   multiple reactions in macromolecular decomposition to obtain a                  more valid extropolations between geological and laboratory time                scales.  The methodology combines a unique macromolecular                       network model of hydrocarbon pyrolysis (FG-DVC) with a unique                   method of analysis (TG-FTIR) of the organic samples from the                    basin.  FG-DVC provides the link between oil, tar and gas                       generation terms of the variation with maturation in Tmax of all                species and the crosslinking associated with CO2, CH4, and H2.                  The kinetic rate coefficients for the evolution of all these                    species can be determined with the TG-FTIR.  In collaboration                   with Dr. Jean Whelan of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute                      (WHOI), we will study two geological basins for which state-of-                 the-art techniques have already been employed to obtain the                     basing's properties.  Samples will be subjected to TG/FTIR                      analysis.  The samples and basin modeling history will be                       employed to develop a \"FG-DVC maturation model\" to predict the                  composition of kerogens in the basin.  The predicted compositions               will then be used in the FG-DVC pyrolysis model to predict the                  behavior under the TG-FTIR analysis.  In addition, samples from                 hydrous pyrolysis of basin samples performed at WHOI and at AFR                 analysis.  In addition, samples from hydrous pyrolysis of basin                 samples performed at WHOI and at APF will also be tested by TG-                 FTIR to determine the rates and mechanisms of chemical                          transformation which occur.",
