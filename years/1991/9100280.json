 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry of copper complexes with dioxygen will be                         explored, as it may relate to that in biological systems.                       Specific pursuits will include: 1) the synthesis of new ligands                 that are able to bind one, two, or three copper ions ligated by                 nitrogen atoms, preferably from the heterocycles pyridine or                    imidazole; 2) the incorporation of groups into such ligands                     that will influence the local copper ion environment by                         positioning a proton, an additional metal ion, a \"substrate-                    binding cavity\" or a non-polar hydrophobic moiety near the                      copper-binding site; 3) a study of the dioxygen, carbon                         monoxide, and anion-binding properties of such complexes; and                   4) conducting oxidation reactions of organic molecules that                     associate with those ligands having a cavity by treating such                   complexes with dioxygen in the presence of substrate. In order                  to achieve these goals, use will be made of rigid organic                       molecules as ligand \"anchors\" that have the requisite                           stereochemical properties to bring the chosen groups into                       proximity, and the known dioxygen chemistry of pyridine- and                    imidazole-ligated copper complexes will be utilized as well.                    The organic frameworks comprise known and derivative                            triptindane and cavitand molecules that can be made in gram                     quantities from relatively simple starting materials.                           %%%                                                                             In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                     metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Thomas N.                       Sorrell of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will                 explore the chemistry of copper complexes with dioxygen.  The                   goal of these studies of model systems is to increase our                       knowledge of how copper-containing enzymes are able to catalyze                 metabolic and biosynthetic reactions.",
