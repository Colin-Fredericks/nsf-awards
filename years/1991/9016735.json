 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a cooperative research                          project between Professor Matthew Tirrell, Department of                        Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of                       Minnesota and Professor Tadao Kotaka, Department of Macro-                      molecular Science, Osaka University, Japan.  The objectives                     of the project are to investigate, both experimentally and                      theoretically, the morphology and some aspects of the                           properties of model block polymers adsorbed and confined on                     surfaces of substrates of various types.  Block polymers                        confined in two-dimensional regions, such as those adsorbed                     on surfaces of given substrates, are in a special thermodynamic                 state different from that of a more familiar three-dimensional                  bulk.  Physico-chemical properties of such thin layers are                      very important scientifically, in the sense that surfaces may                   alter thermodynamic order-disorder transitions, as well as                      for practical applications such as adhesion, surface                            modification and functionalization.  The researchers will                       study the relationships among surface morphology, molecular                     structure and surface physico-chemical properties of block                      polymers confined on two-dimensional structures, to clarify                     the factors controlling the surface morphology of the block                     polymers, and to obtain information on how to attain well-                      controlled surface morphology formation, modification and                       functionalization.                                                                                                                                              The strengths of the two research teams are very complementary,                 the Japanese team having a great deal of experience in                          synthesis and characterization under conventional means and                     the US team having almost unique expertise in characterization                  of surfaces and materials in confined dimensions.  These                        studies will hopefully yield new ways of preparing films with                   specific morphologies and consequently, novel properties,                       thus enhancing our ability to fabricate films with desired                      characteristics for technological applications.",
