 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first objective of this project is to develop a formal model for            reasoning about program executions and race conditions, allowing                different types of race conditions to be precisely defined and                  properties of various techniques to be proven and compared.  This               model will distinguish between the program's actual behavior, its               potential behavior, and its observed behavior.  The second objective            is to  develop dynamic techniques for detecting race conditions as              accurately as possible given the constraint of limited run-time                 information.  These techniques aid the programmer in debugging by               locating those races that are direct manifestations of program bugs             and not artifacts caused by other races, imprecise run-time traces              (causing false races to appear real), or implicit synchronization               (caused by shared-memory references).  These techniques analyze the             observed behavior to conservatively speculate on races that either              did occur or had the potential of occurring, and that were unaffected           by any other race in the execution.  The result of this research is             both a theory in which to reason about race conditions and prove                properties of techniques for race condition detection, and techniques           that aid the programmer by efficiently locating those race conditions           that are of interest for debugging.",
