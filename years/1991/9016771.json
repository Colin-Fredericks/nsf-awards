 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in physics                       between Dr. Gwyn Williams, Brookhaven National Laboratory and                   Dr. Paul Dumas, Laboratoire de Spectrochimie Infrarouge et                      Raman, Thais, France.  The objective of the project is to                       study low frequency modes of adsorbates on metal and                            semiconductor surfaces.                                                                                                                                         Recent developments in infrared synchrotron radiation sources                   have led to the demonstration of their utility as a probe of                    low frequency absorbate-substrate vibrational modes. Such low                   frequency vibrations of adsorbed atoms and molecules contain                    direct information on the adsorbate-substrate bond, which                       controls the stability, reactivity and mobility of adsorbates.                  Few techniques can access these vibrations. Electron Energy                     Loss spectro-scopy (EELS) has provided the most abundant                        information due to its particularly good sensitivity.                           However, its resolution has limited its use for line-shape                      and isotopic shift studies, as well as for work at higher                       pressures. In this project, the US and French investigators                     will use the new infrared synchrotron radiation facility at                     Brookhaven to perform both and EELS studies on surfaces of                      transition and noble metals and semiconductors in the low                       frequency region, combining their expertise EELS (on the                        French side) and surface reflection-absorption spectroscopy                     (on the US side). Dr Williams is internationally recognized                     as a leader in synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and is                        responsible for the development of the far-infrared beamline                    at Brookhaven. Dr. Paul Dumas has developed an outstanding                      surface vibrational laboratory, including research on                           infrared, electron energy loss, and Raman and laser spe-                        ctroscopies. Results of this research are expected to                           contribute to the understanding of the geometry and bonding                     of adsorbates on surfaces, still one of the most important                      problems in surface science.",
