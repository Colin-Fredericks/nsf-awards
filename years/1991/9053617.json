 "awd_abstract_narration": "Courseware is being developed for a self-paced course on modern                 electronic instrumentation and computerized data acquisition.                   This course is aimed at lower division students from all                        engineering disciplines as a lead-in to their discipline                        oriented laboratory courses.  All of the course instruction is                  computer-based; students work individually with laboratory                      equipment, guided by the computer program.  A library of                        modules is supplied allowing faculty to adapt the courseware to                 the specific hardware available in their laboratories. The                      first phase of the development is already complete and the                      resulting courseware has been successful used in two courses at                 Stanford. This project extends the coverage of the existing                     courseware, refines the courseware adding, in particular, more                  direct testing of the student by the computer, and develops the                 library of modules specific to hardware not presently used in                   Stanford laboratories.  Finally, a workshop is to be held to                    introduce the courseware to engineering faculty at other                        universities and to develop a team of collaborators for further                 refinements.",
