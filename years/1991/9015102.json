 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support cooperative research between Dr.                        Herbert Thier of the University of California at Berkeley and                   Dr. David James of Deakin University, Australia.  The outcome                   of this cooperation will be more effective materials for                        educating teachers, students, and the general public about                      chemicals and the societal issues related to the use of                         chemical in both countries. The project is in three phases:                     first, investigation of how one measures what students learn                    in a societal issue oriented science course that is different                   from the outcomes of a traditional science course in the two                    countries; second, analyses and comparisons of the impacts of                   implementation of U.S. and Australian societal issue oriented                   science courses; and, third, a cooperative conference at                        which the accomplishments will be summarized and plans                          developed for continuing the collaborative effort.                                                                                                              The project represents excellent collaboration between the                      Australian and U.S. science education communities. Dr. James                    has expertise in applied chemistry and the implementation of                    societal issue oriented science materials to the public. The                    Royal Australian Chemical Society (RACI), with 8000 members                     throughout Australia, will act as the Australian coordinating                   body for the further development and implemention of the U.S.                   and Australian materials in both countries. Dr. Their, under                    NSF funding, has developed a unique set of U.S. materials,                      the Chemical Education for Public Understanding Program,                        (CEPUP), which has been extensively field-tested and evaluated                  in the United States. The cooperation is important fundamental                  work in developing and evaluating societal issue oriented                       science courses in a cross-cultural setting, and has the                        potential to network school and community educators in                          courses such as biotechnology and global warning in the U.S.                    and Australia.",
