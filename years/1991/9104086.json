 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the use of artificial nanostructures             as a tool to study the growth, interface structure and stability of             amorphous and crystalline semiconductors.  The research will                    address structure, structural relaxation, atomic diffusion and                  crystallization of tetrahedrally-based amorphous semiconductor                  materials (amorphous silicon and related materials).  In addition               the growth and properties of amorphous silicon and related thin                 films with particular emphasis on the relationship between                      structure and electronic properties.  The techniques to be utilized             include: 1) Raman scattering (useful for the study of local bonding             and order); 2) x-ray reflectivity (useful for the study of density,             interface roughness and interdiffusion); 3) optical absorption and              photoconductivity (sensitive to the electronic charge in the layers             and interfaces).  The analysis of the data from these different                 techniques requires different sets of assumptions about materials               and their structure.  Nanostructured semiconductor-based materials              are important technologically for photoelectronic detectors and                 arrays, field effect display drivers, photovoltaic devices, optical             modulation and non-linear optical devices as well as catalysts and              catalyst supports for commercial reactions.",
