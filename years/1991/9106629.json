 "awd_abstract_narration": "Isoprenoids are ubiquitous in nature, essential for life, and                   mediate a number of interactions between organisms and their                    environment.  In addition, plants are a rich source for                         pharmaceutically important isoprenoids.  Yet, our understanding of              the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in plants is limited.  Recent               studies indicate that tobacco cell suspension cultures are uniquely             suited for detailed physiological and biochemical studies of one                important but putative branch point in isoprenoid metabolism.  When             fungal elicitors are added to the cell cultures, the cultures cease             sterol production and instead synthesize and secrete anti-microbial             sesquiterpenoids.  The decline in sterol biosynthesis has been                  correlated with suppression of squalene synthetase enzyme activity,             and the induction of sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis wit the induction             of a sesquiterpene cyclase. Because these two enzymes are                       positioned at a putative branch point in the pathway, the induction             of one enzyme and the suppression of the other were interpreted as              an important regulatory mechanism controlling carbon flow and                   hence, end product formation.  This interpretation suggested that               isoprenoid metabolism was occurring in a homogeneous environment                with intermediates mixing freely and accessible to other to                     successive or competing enzymes.  Recent results suggest otherwise              and indicate that independently regulated arrays of isozymes                    dedicated to the production of specific end products might be                   aligned along a surface or membrane.. This hypothesis of discrete               metabolic channels predicts selective transcription of genes coding             for enzymes of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in elicitor-treated cells             versus genes for sterol metabolism in control cells, and that the               enzyme proteins must have targeting information for insertion into              the correct metabolic channel or unit.  The goals of this work are              to test these predictions using a molecular approach including                  cloning of the sesquiterpene cyclase and squalene synthetase genes,             analysis of the cis-elements directing their expression, and fusion             of their putative targeting signal onto a reporter gene which will              either alter the kind or amount of isoprenoid formed.  Results from             these studies will help elucidate the mechanisms regulating                     isoprenoid metabolism in plants, and will have important impact on              for future manipulations of this pathway using genetic engineering              technology.//",
