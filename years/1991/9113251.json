 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nothing is more central to macroeconomics than the attempt to                   understand business cycles.  A large fraction of all                            macroeconomic research in recent years has been devoted to                      exploring the implications of models in which all households and                firms form expectations about the future rationally and act in                  the pursuit of well-defined objectives, and comparing these                     implications to observed facts about business cycles.  The                      contribution of this project comes from developing and studying                 analytically business cycle models that are more consistent                     qualitatively and quantitatively with observed facts about                      business cycles.                                                                                                                                                More specifically, the project extends and solves analytically a                central set of business cycle models based on Professor Edward                  Prescott's Real Business Cycle Model.  The following elements are               added to this model:  distortionary taxation, more than one                     production sector, changes in the composition of government                     spending, more than one type of labor, time-nonseparabilities in                the utility, and sluggish price adjustment.  These elements                     capture important aspects of economic reality missing in other                  models of business cycles.",
