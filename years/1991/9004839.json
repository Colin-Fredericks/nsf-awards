 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program is designed to explore how the properties of               genes and the stability of regions within genes are influenced by               neighboring DNA sequences.  Bacterial intradiol dioxygenase                     genes, the subjects of the investigation, share common ancestry                 and have undergone numerous rearrangements during their                         evolutionary divergence.  Rearrangements might be expected to                   lead to the physical separation of independently transcribed                    genes, but the chromosomal position of divergent oxygenase genes                has been conserved within different supraoperonic clusters.                     Selective forces favoring the clustering of genes will be                       explored by examining the physiological and genetic consequences                of directed transposition of oxygenase genes from one cluster to                another.  Transposition can lead to genetic instability, and a                  possible source of instability is sequence-directed mutation, a                 process that can lead to deletions between regions of DNA                       sequence repetition.  The extent to which sequence-directed                     mutations occur will be explored by comparison of the DNA                       sequences of genes that have undergone spontaneous mutation                     either in their normal location or after transposition to a                     different cluster.  Processes that lead to sequence-directed                    mutation also might contribute to genetic repair, and this                      possibility will be explored by analysis of DNA sequence of                     mutations that revert readily.  Enzymatic activation of oxygen is               a fundamental biological process, and the genetic analysis of                   oxygenases will increase our understanding of biochemical steps                 that direct the assimilation of molecular oxygen into organic                   substrates.  We plan to isolate mutant oxygenases that are                      functional but altered in substrate specificity or in catalytic                 efficiency,.  Analysis of these proteins is likely to provide                   novel insight into interactions between oxygenases and their                    substrates.",
