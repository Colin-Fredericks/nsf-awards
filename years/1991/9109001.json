 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of projects involving novel and topical materials                      including the new high temperature superconductors, heavy Fermion               materials (including the exotic heavy fermion superconductors),                 and the transition metals and their compounds is proposed.                      Specifically, a new speculative model proposed to explain the                   anomalous superconductivity which occurs in the high temperature                superconductors and some heavy fermion materials and the effect                 of magnetic/kondo impurities on disorder-induced weak                           localization will be parameterized, tested, and used to calculate               the phase diagrams of transition metals from first principles.                  The basic problem is to accurately calculate various physical                   properties of these materials.  However, the electronic                         correlations in these materials make this difficult.  To overcome               these problems novel combinations of established techniques like                quantum Monte Carlo, the local density approximation, and self-                 consistent perturbation theories, as well as generating new                     techniques will be used.  These techniques are computationally                  intense, and implementation is only now possible due to recent                  advances in computer technology.",
