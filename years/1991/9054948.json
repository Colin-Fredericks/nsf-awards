 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three year program that includes 1) the                       training of ten new two-member \"Mentor Teacher\" teams, and                      2) a series of twenty three, two-week workshops led by 16                       Mentor Teacher teams.  Mentor Teachers are previous                             participants in NSF sponsored leadership development                            projects in human genetics and bioethical decision-making                       held at Ball State University and conducted by the staff of                     the Human Genetics and Bioethics Educational Laboratory                         (HGABEL).                                                                                                                                                       Six, two-member, Mentor Teacher teams were trained with                         previous NSF funding.  The training of ten new teams will                       take place during the summers of 1991 and 1992 at Ball State                    University.  The Mentor Teacher led workshops will take                         place, nationwide, during the summers of 1991, 1992, and                        1993.  These workshops will be based upon an effective model                    workshop that was developed, tested, and evaluated by Mentor                    Teachers and HGABEL staff during three previous workshops                       involving 54 teachers and over 5300 students.                                                                                                                   The purpose of this program is to prepare over 550 high                         school biology teachers to 1) instruct their students about                     concepts in human genetics, and 2) develop student skills in                    bioethical decision making.  Workshops will emphasize hands-                    on experiences, many of which are directly applicable to the                    classroom.  Other pedagogical strategies employed will                          involve contemporary learning cycles and classroom behavior                     modeling by the Mentor Teachers.                                                                                                                                An amount equal to 62% of the NSF award will be provided as                     cost sharing.",
