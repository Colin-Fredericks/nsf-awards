 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on steroid hormones                    to be conducted by Anthony Norman of the University of                          California at Riverside and his Argentine colleague R. Boland                   of the National University of the South in Bahia Blanca,                        Argentina.  They propose a collaborative research program                       directed towards studies on the biochemical mode of action of                   the hormonally active form of vitamin D.  While it is                           generally accepted that steroid hormones generate biological                    responses through regulation of gene expression, it is not                      widely accepted that steroid hormones can generate significant                  biological responses through mechanisms not dependent upon                      immediate regulation of gene expression.  Both laboratories                     have published a series of papers reporting that 1,25(OH)2D3                    can generate biological responses in muscle (Bahia Blanca)                      and the intestine (Riverside) by nuclear receptor-mediated                      modulation of gene expression as well as by a pathway(s) in                     which a putative membrane recognition element for 1,25(OH)2D3                   is implicated in processes which generate biological responses                  within 1-5 minutes.                                                                                                                                             The major objectives of this proposal are (a) to initiate a                     collaborative characterization of the membrane-related                          receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3 in intestine, HL-60 cells and muscle                   and compare it with the classical nuclear receptor for                          1,25 (OH)2D3 and (b) further define the biochemical details                     of the signal transduction pathway leading to \"rapid\"                           biological responses which lead in the intestine to the                         process of \"transcaltachia\" or the very rapid stimulation of                    intestinal calcium absorption.  Specifically the Riverside                      laboratory will study the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors in                      (a) gene expression particularly as exemplified by examination                  of the calbindin-D28K gene's promoter and (b) the process of                    transcaltachia or the very rapid stimulation of intestinal                      calcium transport (via nongenomic mechanisms).  The Bahia                       Blanca laboratory will study the function and mechanism of                      action of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its receptor(s) in muscle.  This                      work will formalize an existing active collaboration.",
