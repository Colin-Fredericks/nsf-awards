The project                                               is initiated in FY 91 for a 5-year                                              period.                                                                                                                                                         The objectives of the project are                                               to conduct the following studies:                                                                                                                               (a) Analysis of more general types                                              of pounding based on elastic and                                                inelastic modeling of steel, RC,                                                and masonry structures.  The effect                                             of various structural and                                                       excitation parameters on pounding                                               response and damage will be                                                     clarified.  Development of a very                                               simple and practical tool to assess                                             seismic performance of already                                                  existing buildings or newly                                                     designed buildings against possible                                             pounding incidents.  The method                                                 will be verified by correlating its                                             results with pounding damage of                                                 existing buildings.  Development of                                             pounding mitigation scheme.  Study                                              on pounding of base isolation                                                   system.  Shaking table tests for                                                pounding of adjacent buildings of                                               steel, R.C., and masonry                                                        construction.  Existing test models                                             will be modified and tested to                                                  study pounding using shake table.
