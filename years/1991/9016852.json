 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a cooperative research project in                       medium energy physics between Professor Robert P. Redwine of                    the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Professor Osamu                   Hashimoto of the Institute for Nuclear Study, University of                     Tokyo.  The scientists will cooperate in investigating the                      interactions of pions with nuclei in the energy range around                    and above the delta resonance.  This project is based on a                      great amount of work that has been carried out in the past 15                   years on interactions in the delta resonance region, especially                 at LAMPF in Los Alamos.   This experimental and theoretical                     work has increased considerably the understanding of the                        interaction mechanism itself and specific nuclear structure                     issues as well.  As expected, many aspects of the pion-nucleus                  interaction in this region are dominated by the formation of                    the delta resonance in the nucleus.  This has proved to be                      both an advantage and a disadvantage.  As the delta does                        appear to be so dominant, use of this dominance in descriptions                 of the interaction have been reasonably successful.  On the                     other hand, this dominance can mask other interesting physics                   issues.                                                                                                                                                         In this project, the investigators will involve scientists                      from several other leading U.S. and Japanese research                           institutions who have been conducting experiments of this                       type.  In particular, scientists from the Brookhaven National                   Laboratory and the Japanese Laboratory for High Energy                          Physics (KEK) will be involved.  With the commissioning of                      new spectrometers at the KEK laboratory in Japan, studies                       with higher energy pions will enter a new phase and U.S.                        scientists will have the opportunity to play an important                       role in this opening field.",
