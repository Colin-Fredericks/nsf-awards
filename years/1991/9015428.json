Icelandic is a very interesting language for                studying the acquisition of binding, as it has binding properties               that are distinct from English.  In particular, Icelandic has a                 \"long distance\" reflexive construction which has generated                      considerable interest in linguistic theory and has motivated                    theoretical work in language acquisition as well.                                                                                                               The data will be collected in Reykjavik, Iceland.  30 children,                 ages 3;0-6;0, will serve as subjects of three experiments                       designed to determine their interpretations of reflexives and                   pronouns, and thus to illuminate the course of the acquisition of               binding in Icelandic.                                                                                                                                           The results of this study will bear on a number of issues in                    acquisition theory and linguistic theory.  First, it will provide               a description of the Icelandic child's acquisition of binding, an               area which has received very little attention, and thus will                    contribute to the growing body of cross-linguistic research into                the development of binding.  In addition, it will illuminate                    aspects of the syntax of Icelandic, in particular, the linguistic               analysis of long distance reflexives.  Finally, the study has                   direct implications for general linguistic theory and for the                   developmental processes involved in the acquisition of syntax.",
