The research will employ a near afterglow H2 plasma source                      developed at Colorado State University, which will be placed in                 an existing Tokyo University OMCVD reactor to achieve epitaxial                 films of GaAs on ZnSe and Si, while the ZnSe will be deposited on               GaAs.  The feedstock precursors will be limited to only organ                   metallic gases of methyl and ethyl compounds.  Near afterglow                   OMVD has hither to been largely unexplored despite its capability               to provide a lower deposition temperature; in-situ H2 plasma                    cleaning of substrate prior to growth; in-situ hydride and                      hydride radical (e.g. AsH2, AsH, etc.) generation; and lower                    residual carbon both at interfaces and in bulk films.  The role                 of the hydrogen will be delineated for both gas phase OMCVD                     reactions, formation of AsHx radicals, as well as carbon                        gasification reactions via mass spectroscopic deuterium isotope                 tracer studies.  All gas phase studies will be correlated to                    deposited film properties material characterization at Tokyo                    University will emphasize:  photoluminescence, double crystal x-                ray diffraction and SIMS.",
