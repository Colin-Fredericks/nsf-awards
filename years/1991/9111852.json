 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concerns about prospects for changing climatic conditions across the         globe have given new impetus to inquiries that would identify zones             where the impacts of such changes can be readily monitored and analyzed.        One such set of zones are alpine treeline ecotones, where montane               forests gradually give way to barren slopes or alpine tundra.  Previous         studies have shown these areas to be locales where even minor climatic          changes can induce profound changes in vegetation patterns.  This               collaborative research project will conduct intensive analyses of               patterns of treeline species and will explore relationships among               various factors that affect the number and location of species.                 Research will focus on sites in Glacier National Park of Montana.  Data         will be gathered from satellite images and field observations of                climatic variables and soil and bedrock conditions.  Data from digital          elevation models and tree rings also will be used to construct and test         statistical and path models that represent how treeline distributions           respond to interactions among different variables over time.                       This collaborative project will provide new data and models that             enhance knowledge about interactions among different factors in alpine          treeline zones, both at the study site and in many other mountainous            environments.  This project may provide new metrics for identifying the         impacts of changing climatic conditions, and it also will explore new           methods for monitoring and evaluating the use of remote sensed data and         geographic information systems in vegetation modelling.",
