 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator award will enable the                      investigator to pursue an integrated program of research on the                 production and perception of speech, including the development of               these capacities in children acquiring their native language.                                                                                                   The investigator has developed a model of speech production which               has become extremely influential in the field.  He has identified               a number of shortcoming in the model, particularly with respect                 to questions of the timing of speech.  He is now exploring a new                family of algorithm which show promise for a better treatment of                the timing issues, and which also appear to relate interestingly                to phenomena of speech perception.  During the ensuing grant                    period, he will pursue this theoretical development in depth,                   with particular reference to the problem of modeling inter-work                 phenomena.                                                                                                                                                      The research plans also include further theoretical and empirical               work on the problem of speech acquisition.  There is a                          fundamental question of acquisition related to the problem of how               it is an infant can learn to perform the complex motor activities               of speech based on the acoustic data the child receives as a                    model.  The investigator has developed a hypothesis that speech                 acquisition is based on the development of an internal model of                 the vocal tract during babbling, and will be exploring its                      implications, including implications for the perceptual                         correlates of coarticulation.  The hypothesis makes certain                     predictions about the order of acquisition of various speech                    sounds, and another research direction is to test the empirical                 validity of these predictions.",
