 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anticipated research involves projects on deep inelastic                      scattering of electrons from various nuclear targets at SLAC.                   Experimental data obtained will be analyzed at SLAC and at UC-                  Berkeley.  The several nuclear and high energy projects in                      which the investigator will participate include: 1) the                         measurement of x, Q , and HydrogeDeuterium Dependence of R                      (ratio of longitudinal  to transverse photoabsorption cross                     section); 2) the analysis of data on electron-gas-nuclei                        interactions at electron energy of 14.5 GeV; and 3) the                         planning of future experiments utilizing a 50-GeV polarized                     electron beam.  In the latter, former PEGASYS collaborators                     expect to develop proposals for future End Station A (SLAC)                     experiments to study interactions of high-energy polarized                      electron beams on various nuclear targets.                                        These projects are concerned with aspects of deep inelastic                   electron-nucleus scattering, and will yield new information on                  perturbative QCD effects, nuclear scaling, and other phenomena                  in the interface between particle and nuclear physics.  The                     project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                              opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigators'                        enhanced visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In                    this project, the proposed activities which contribute to the                   second objective include:  teaching an upper-division course                    for physics majors, leading/assisting with graduate seminars                    on nuclear/particle physics, presenting informal guest lectures                 or lunch talks for graduate students, mentoring of women                        graduate students, and serving as a catalyst for special                        informal meetings of women in physics, as well as stimulating                   contacts between women in physics and those in other                            scientific/engineering disciplines.",
