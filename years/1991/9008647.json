 "awd_abstract_narration": "In December 1988, the Marine Systems Engineering                                Laboratory (MSEL) began a program, funded by the National                       Science Foundation (Grant No. EID-8818406), to investigate                      the key issues in the design of knowledge-based systems                         for use in Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) systems.                         It was directed at understanding some of the problems                           associated with utilizing these knowledge-based systems in                      real time domains.  The efforts focused on establishing a                       symbolic processing environment which would exist on top                        of a real time operating system.                                                                                                                                This effort which builds on the results of the initial                          work, reflects the insights which were developed during                         the initial phase of this program.  The investigations                          will be accomplished over a two year period and will                            result in the implementation of a intelligent real-time                         scheduler for expert systems running in Autonomous                              Undersea Vehicle (AUV) systems.  It defines an effort to                        develop a scheduling algorithm in accordance with the                           criteria specified as a result of our previous work in                          designing real-time expert systems.  The product of this                        effort will be a domain-independent scheduling algorithm                        suitable for use in any environment where multiple                              knowledge sources interact in a time-constrained fashion.",
