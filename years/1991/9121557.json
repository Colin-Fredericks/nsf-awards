 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mixed convection in porous channels has been numerically                        simulated to investigate the inverse relation between Nusselt                   number and Rayleigh number when the forced flow opposes the                     buoyancy.  The viscous term has been found to influence the                     results to a much greater degree than the inertial term.                        Support is being provided to review mixed flow in porous flows                  in general, and these results in particular, at the                             International Center for Heat and Mass Transfer in Dubrovnik,                   Yugoslavia.                                                                                                                                                     The seminar to be presented is aimed at documenving recent                      advances in the fundamentals of mixed convection in porous                      media and their applications.  The intent is to provide the                     heat transfer community with a reference work that will                         complement the Proceedings of the 1990 NATO Advanced Study                      Institute held in Izmir.",
