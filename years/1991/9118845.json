 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore the reactivity and structural                        chemistry of tervalent nickel in coordination environments                      which are thought to mimic those found for nickel hydrogenase                   enzymes.  These enzymes are responsible for the reversible                      conversion of of hydrogen--an essential conversion in anaerobic                 metabolism for both chemotrophic and phototrophic bacteria. The                 coordination environment of the nickel site varies with                         different organisms. A consensus coordination sphere has 2-4                    nitrogen or oxygen donors and 1-3 sulphur or selenium donors                    around nickel. Stabilization of nickel in its tervalent                         oxidation state will be a significant synthetic challenge due                   to the propensity of these systems to degrade by disulfide                      formation and concomitant metal reduction. A new class of                       ligands based on triazacyclononane will be designed and                         synthesized to circumvent this problem. The incorporation of                    other metals in this unique coordination environment will also                  be investigated.                                                                %%%                                                                             This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Daniel                 Stack's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry in                        support of his research at Stanford University. The thrust of                   Dr. Stack's research is the design, synthesis and                               characterization of analogs of nickel hydrogenases.",
