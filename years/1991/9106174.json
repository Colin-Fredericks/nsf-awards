 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies on bacteria D-amino acid transaminase will focus on                     the functional groups at its active site, its stereochemical                    mechanism, and its role in bacteria as a target for enzyme                      activated inhibitors.  The gene that encodes this enzyme                        allows several hundred milligrams of pure enzyme to be                          prepared in one week.  Several site-directed mutagenesis                        studies have been carried out; the most interesting is the                      change of the active site Lys-145, which binds pyridoxal-5'-                    phosphate, to Gin.  This mutant turns over very slowly so                       that the kinetics of formation of several intermediated can                     be easily measured.  Thus, the formation of the Schiff base                     with the substrate, D-alanine, takes place over a period of                     minutes at 27o.  Exogenous (added) amines have a significant                    effect on the rate of Schiff base (aldimine formation).  The                    rate of formation of the E-PMP and/or ketimine form takes                       place over a period of hours and the exogenous amines have no                   effect on this step with this mutant enzyme.  The effect of a                   large number of amines with the K145Q mutant enzyme and the                     K145N mutant will be ascertained in the present proposal.                       The K145Q mutant enzyme is under less stringent                                 stereochemical control than is the wild-type enzyme (see                        enclosed galley proofs of manuscript in press).  This result                    will be extended with isotope studies to determine which                        proton of the C-4 of PMP is retained or released in the wild-                   type enzyme as well as in the K145Q and K145N mutant enzymes.                   L-Ala and L-Glu can undergo one turnover with D-amino acid                      transaminase in the half-reaction to yield the corresponding                    keto aid and the pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate form of the                          enzyme.  However, in the second half of the reaction, i.e.,                     transfer o the amino group to another keto acid only D-amino                    acids are formed.  Therefore, stereochemical fidelity is                        maintained.  These experiments will also be performed with                      the K145Q and K145N mutant enzyme to determine whether there                    is less stereochemical constraint as measured by this                           technique also.                                                                 D-serine, a relatively slow substrate, generates a quinonoid-                   like intermediate band at 493 nm.  The half-life of species                     is of the order of hours and its disappearance is correlated                    with inactivation of the enzyme.  Preliminary studies by                        stopped-flow methods indicate that another quinonoid with a                     rapid turnover is formed.  These studies will be continued.                     The mode of inactivation by D-serine by use of 14C-labeled                      compound and peptide mapping will be investigated.                              D-Amino acid transaminase inactivated by chloro-D alanine,                      cycloserine, or gabaculine will be investigated by difference                   maps once the structure of the wild-type enzyme is                              established.  The inactivation of D-amino acid transaminase                     by various suicide substrates and the accumulation of                           intermediates during this process will be studied.",
