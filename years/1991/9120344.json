The              overall goal of this national teleconference is to inform                       undergraduate students and employees without advanced training in               science and engineering fields of the difference between                        undergraduate education and graduate level training and                         responsibilities.  In addition, this teleconference will focus on               the process of selecting the graduate school best suited to one's               particular needs.  This information will be prepared and presented              with a multi-ethnic and multi-racial viewing audience in mind.",
