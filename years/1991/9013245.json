 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic assumption upon which Dr. Winner bases this research is               that, in an age characterized by rapid, pervasive technological                 change, the traditional concerns of political thought must expand               to included choices that may seem to be merely technical ones.  He              argues that the building of new systems in production,                          transportation, information, communications, and the like involves              not only matters of efficiency, productivity, reliability and the               like, but also questions about freedom membership, authority,                   community, and the distribution of social power.  One point at                  which these issues might be fruitfully addressed is at the design               stage of technological development.  Under this grant, Dr. Winner               is examining three aspects of design in technological development.              First, he is examining a variety of historical examples to show how             the design of technological systems can have political                          consequences.  Second, he is comparing three traditions of design-              -political theory, architecture, and industrial engineering--to see             what they have to say about the relationship of form and content                in the structures they ponder.  Third, he is attempting to develop              a political theory of design, one that can offer advice on value                choices to be made about the shape of evolving technological                    systems.  He will apply this theory to a number of currently                    evolving sociotechnical fields, including the designs of digital                bank card systems and their implications for issues of privacy and              individual freedom.",
