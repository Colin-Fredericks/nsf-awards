 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research examines the evolution of wing melanin               pattern in two closely related lepidopteran species, Pieris                     occidentalis and P. protodice.  Populations of P. occidentalis                  exhibit considerable latitudinal and elevational variation in                   melanin pattern, and both species exhibit seasonal variation.                   Melanin pattern functions in the regulation of body temperature                 and in courtship.  Previous field experiments have demonstrated                 that P. occidentalis females prefer males with disproportionately               large melanin characters in a specific region of the wing, and                  that they use the same characters to recognize and avoid males of               P. protodice.  Whether females benefit thereby is unknown.  In P.               occidentalis, the characters involved in mate choice are known to               affect temperature regulation in other populations, but selection               for thermoregulation favors reduced character size.  In this                    research, field experiments will be used to measure female choice               in P. occidentalis and P. protodice as a function of male melanin               pattern variation, population density, and female reproductive                  status.  The interaction between selection for temperature                      regulation and selected for reproductive success will be examined               by measuring female choice in populations of P. occidentalis that               differ in thermal environment.  Whether females benefit from                    choosing highly melanized males will be measured in the                         laboratory by measuring several components of female reproductive               success.                                                                             Very little is known about how different kinds of selection                interact to produce the observed variation in any character,                    because there are relatively few traits where all of the                        functions are well-understood.  Studying how female choice for                  male melanin varies among populations with different thermal                    environments will provide such an opportunity.  By quantifying                  the relationship between male wing color pattern and female mate                choice, as well as the consequences for females of mate choice,                 the proposed research will address whether P. occidentalis                      females benefit from mate choice, and the extent to which female                choice determines the evolution of male wing color pattern in                   this species.  Comparisons of  P. occidentalis with its close                   relative P. protodice will determine the importance of female                   mate choice for the  differentiation of male color pattern                      between these two species.",
