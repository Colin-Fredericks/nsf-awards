 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems addressed in this research project are in the                 area of differential topology.  Their common theme is to develop                relations between the geometry and topology of group actions and                foliations, their cohomology invariants, and the analytic                       invariants of differential operators naturally associated with                  their geometry.  Steven Hurder will work on rigidity of Anosov                  actions of \"large\" groups; on the \"topology-at-infinity\" of open                manifolds, based on K-theory invariants of differential                         operators; on the classifications of low-dimensional Anosov                     diffeomorphisms, using secondary classes and moduli spaces for                  quasi-symmetric maps; and on the spectrum of elliptic operators                 on leaves of foliations, using the dynamics of the geodesic flow                of the foliation.                                                                    This collection of problems concerns natural objects,                      manifolds, i.e. locally Euclidean geometric spaces.  The                        properties dealt with are such things as symmetry of these                      objects and flows defined on them, all to be investigated by a                  variety of techniques from algebra and analysis.",
