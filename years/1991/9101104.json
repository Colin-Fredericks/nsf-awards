 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will continue                   working on three problems involving real and complex analysis on                domains.  The first problem concerns an examination of function                 spaces designed for boundary value problems for partial                         differential operators defined on domains in real Euclidean                     space.  The second problem concerns the study of automorphism                   groups of domains in complex n-space and how their group-                       theoretic properties are determined by the geometry of the                      boundary of the domain.  The third problem concerns various                     subproblems in the function theory of several complex variables;                to wit, boundary uniqueness theorems for holomorphic mappings,                  biholomorphic exhaustions of domains by other domains, and the                  boundary behavior of holomorphic functions.                                          Complex analysis is one of the oldest branches of modern                   mathematics.  The principal objects of study in complex analysis                are functions with special properties called holomorphic or                     analytic functions.  Holomorphic functions are capable of                       expressing relationships and equivalences between complex                       quantities in two or more space dimensions.  In this project the                principal investigator will study the behavior of holomorphic                   functions at the boundaries of their domains of definition.  The                boundary behavior of holomorphic functions is very often the most               interesting (and difficult|) aspect of the theory.",
