 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                 the Chemistry Division, Professor Schlegel will develop new                     algorithms for reaction path following on molecular potential                   energy surfaces. The PI uses these computational tools to study                 the thermodynamics and reactivity of molecules containing                       silicon, hydrogen and flourine that are relevant to chemical                    vapor deposition of amorphous silicon films for photovoltaics                   and etching of silicon surfaces for microelectronics.                                                                                                           A family of five new reaction path following algorithms is                      proposed. Previously developed spin projection methods for                      correlation corrections to ground state wave functions will be                  extended and spin projections will be developed for CI singles                  calculations (single substitutions in the ground state                          determinantal function) of excited states. A new transition                     structure optimization algorithm  and a new type of electric                    field dependent basis to calculate improved dipole moments,                     polarizability and infrared intensities will be developed. In                   the area of applications the mechanism of simple photochemical                  reactions will be explored. Reaction path following will be                     used to study the effect of solvent molecules on transition                     states for SN2 reactions. Transition structures and barrier                     heights will be determined for radical abstractions, radical                    additions to multiple bonds and diradical cycloaddition                         reactions. The study of the thermal decomposition of silicon                    compounds will be continued.",
