 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues a longitudinal study of 9000 men and                     women, first interviewed as high school seniors in 1957.  Subse-                quent interviews in 1958, 1964, and 1975 have tracked family for-               mation, entry and progression in the labor force, and orientation               to work and career.  This survey, with respondents now in their                 50s, permits study of aging phenomena, retirements, grandchil-                  dren, health, death of family members, wealth transfer, and                     stability or breakup of marriages.  In addition, 7500 siblings of               the respondents will be interviewed, providing information on the               social context of ambition and other factors in respondents'                    lives.  The main goals of this project are (1) to identify and                  measure characteristics of people, firms, and job type that                     influence chances of employment; (2) to develop and extend mea-                 surement methods and models of achievement and earnings; (3) to                 elaborate the effects of sibling influences on achievement,                     social participation, well-being, health, success in child rear-                ing, providing for retirement, and patterns of health and mor-                  tality; (4) to measure social and economic exchange relations                   with parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings to assess                   consequences of those relationships for well being. Results will                improve sociological theories of stratification and mobility,                   aging, and family processes, as well as having implications for                 policies affecting the aging nature of the U.S. population.",
