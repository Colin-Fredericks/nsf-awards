 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective is to isolate the factors that control the               self-assembly of amphiphilic polymers and surfactants.  In solution             these molecules aggregate into clusters that alter the macroscopic              rheological and phase behavior of the host fluid.  In order to                  relate microstructure to macroscopic properties, the factors that               control the structure of polymer-surfactant complexes must be                   determined.  Monte Carlo and analytic techniques will be used to                systematically vary the polymer and surfactant concentration,                   architecture and interaction energies and, thus, to determine the               size and shape of the resulting clusters.  Scaling laws will then               be developed to relate the size of these clusters to the length and             number of chains in the aggregate.  The scaling laws will be used               to relate the microstructure and growth of the cluster to the                   macroscopic viscosity.  Statistical models will be developed to                 determine the phase behavior of the polymer/surfactant/solvent                  mixture.                                                                        %%%                                                                             The self-assembly of amphiphilic polymers and surfactants in                    solution is of intrinsic scientific interest and also has many                  applications.  These molecules form comb-like structures and are                difficult to model.  This work will be one of the first attempts to             fully describe these systems.  Understanding of these novel                     materials will assist in the design of macromolecular solutions                 with prescribed properties.  The results of this study will assist              in the development of materials that are useful for applications in             controlled drug release, viscosity modification, enhanced oil                   recovery and separation processes.",
