The Symposium is designed to bring to comparative               biologists who work with a diverse array of organisms, some of the              new insights and approaches now being used to elucidate the mode                of action of neuropeptides and the roles that they play in the                  regulation of physiological processes.  The topics will include the             evolution and roles of neuropeptide families, genetic approaches                to neuropeptide synthesis, neuropeptide processing and release                  (including evolution of release sites), conformation and regulation             of neuropeptide receptors, and neurophysiological and behavioral                actions of neuropeptides.  Both invertebrate and vertebrate model               systems will be discussed.  The 10 speakers include both                        established and young investigators.  The highlights of the                     Symposium will be summarized by the organizers and published in the             American Zoologist.//",
