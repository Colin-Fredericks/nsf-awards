 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project -- the final two years of a five-year endeavor                -- involves the collecting, preparation and study of outstanding                remains of extinct vertebrates from the eastern Wind T+River                    Basin, Wyoming.  Specifically, the project involves:                                 (1) the excavation of extremely reich fossil quarries that                 produce unparalleled skulls, skeletons, and dentitions (50                      million years old) of the earliest forerunners of many groups os                rhinoceroses, even-toed ungulates, bats, marsupials and rodents:                (2) survey of adjacent badland rocks (60 million to 35 million                  years old) to recover additional fossil vertebrates from a longer               temporal sequence and broader paleoecological settings in order                 to reconstruct ancient ecosystems and biodiversity; and  (3) the                and relationships of these ancient animals.  Analysis of the                    paleobiological problems.                                                            Accomplishments of this project to date include:                                (1) discovery and 60% excavation of extremely rich quarries                preserving skulls and skeletons of many Eocene mammals and                      lizards hitherto known only from teeth and jaws;  (2) scientific                descriptions and analyses of the material representing ancient                  marsupials, primates, armadillo-like beasts, rodents, archaic                   ungulates, and even-toed ungulates:  (3) analyses of new,                       remarkable specimens, e.g.: first known skulls of tarsier-like                  Shoshonius has overturned traditional views on the primate                      evolutionary tree; skulls of the lemur-like Notharctus venticolus               demonstrate the oldest record of primate sexual dimorphism and                  imply early primate social behaviors; skull of new rodent,                      Armintomys, reveals earliest appearance of a specialized jaw                    structure called hystricomorphy, a major evolutionary innovation                in rodents;  (4) more precise geology and stratigraphic                         correlation of Eocene faunas and horizons n the Western Interior                of the Rocky Mountains using conventional geologic techniques,                  and satellite/aircraft remote sensing imagery;  (5) analysis of                 biodiversity and faunal change through time; and (6) detailed                   studies of evolutionary patterns processes through time.                             Since 1988, these accomplishments have been documented in 23               papers in professional journals, student dissertations and                      theses, and presentations at professional meetings.",
