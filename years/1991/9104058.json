 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boundary element and finite element discretizations of                     integral equations and partial differential equations over                      surfaces and bodies often lead to very large linear systems of                  equations.  If the domain enjoys any symmetry, the computational                effort involved in numerically solving these systems can be                     significantly reduced via the effective use of techniques based                 upon group representation theory which have recently been given                 by the investigators.  This algebraic approach yields a                         decomposition of the original large problem into a number of                    smaller subproblems, each corresponding to an irreducible                       representation of the symmetry group of the domain.  The size of                each reduced problem is that of the large problem divided by a                  factor equal to the order of the group divided by the dimension                 of the representation.  Previous work on exploiting symmetry has                involved reducing partial differential equations to subdomains                  and adapting boundary conditions over the symmetry axes.  Such                  techniques do not apply to boundary integral methods.  It is                    proposed in this project to develop flexible codes which                        systematically implement reductions for a variety of symmetry                   structures.  Constructions of symmetry-respecting                               discretizations and theoretical investigations relating to                      sparseness and parallel implementations will be carried out.                         Many problems in science and engineering have as their                     natural domain a surface or body which is symmetric in some way.                For example, circles, circular disks, spheres, intervals,                       squares, and cubes, of any dimension, all have obvious symmetry.                In addition to the symmetry of the domain of the problem,                       often the equations themselves reflect a symmetry in the physics                of the problem.  For example, the differential equations                        governing heat flow are symmetric, in the sense that heat will                  flow in all directions without any preferences in the absence of                any outside stimulus.  When both the equations and the domain of                the problem enjoy some symmetry, algebraic techniques may be used               to reduce the computational effort involved in numerically                      solving the given problem on the given domain.  This project will               focus on making the necessary theoretical investigations and                    developing algorithms for exploiting symmetry in the field                      of numerical analysis.",
