 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will work with                  the postdoctoral associate Patricia Lewis on the asymptotic                     analysis of certain classes of two-dimensional integral equations               that contain a large parameter.  The main thrust of the research                will be to develop new methods for finding asymptotically correct               approximate solutions of the equations as the large parameter                   approaches infinity.  Such problems arise in investigations of                  the behavior of waves propagating in two dimensions in the limit                of large wavenumber.  This research will be especially valuable                 because numerical solutions of the integral equations are not                   reliable as the parameter becomes large.                                             Asymptotic methods work because the largeness or smallness                 of a parameter in an equation can be used to simplify the                       equation to the point where an approximate solution, which is                   still meaningful, can be found more easily.  In this project the                principal investigator and a postdoctoral associate will use                    asymptotic methods to find accurate approximate solutions of                    integral equations that model the behavior of waves propagating                 in the limit of large wavenumber.",
