 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical analysis shows that the very successful tradition of                 formalism-intensive physics teaching has inadvertently deprived                 college students of the opportunity to learn about, and                         experience with, a wide range of physical phenomena of                          contemporary interest.  The key to remedy the situation                         significantly is to expose the students early in their college                  education to physical phenomena, the very stuff that sustains                   physics.  This project involves a new concept of laboratory                     teaching with a strong phenomenological orientation in order to                 bring about a balance to the otherwise effective and rigorous                   tradition.  The two key requirements are to compensate for the                  gap in the students preparedness and to break down the physical                 phenomena of interest to the point where it is both transparent                 and accessible.  This can be accomplished by complimentary use                  of numerical simulation and experimental measurement with                       emphasis on optical and electrical visualization.  A new                        teaching laboratory has been created toward this goal, suitable                 for an introductory instructional setting where students of                     broad curricular background participate.  A number of theme-                    oriented experiment modules have been developed to different                    levels of completeness, with topics drawn from mechanics,                       electricity and magnetism, optics, spectroscopy and                             thermodynamics.  Further research and development of selected                   experiment modules are being carried out, with a view toward                    ready transferability of the concept to other institutions as                   well as to other scientific disciplines.",
