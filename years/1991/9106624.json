 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will focus their research on fully developing                 the automated instrumentation capabilities of microscopic systems               that offer the potential for quantifying the 3-D shape                          parameters, and changes in shape parameters over time, of                       microscopic-scale biological specimens.  They plan to continue                  their program of studying diversity of complementary imaging                    modalities, including confocal microscopy, stereo microscopy, and               conventional optical sectioning microscopy.  The program of study               will encompass microscopic data acquisition via various methods.                The images obtained will be subjected to appropriate filtering                  schemes base on the physical principles of image formation to                   sharpen and improve image clarity in individual micrographs and                 to remove information spurious to that of the local specimen                    structure.  The filtering techniques, which will require                        considerable analytic study in their development, will be                       specific to each optical system used. Finally, the aggregate                    local optical data will be assembled and analyzed via                           sophisticated numerical instrumentation techniques to reconstruct               the 3-D structure of a given imaged specimen and to quantify its                size and shape characteristics as it evolves over time.  The                    methods developed will be implemented and evaluated on a broad                  range of specimen types, including stained and unstained single                 and multiple celled subjects.  Several different tissue                         preparations will be used to study the time evolution of specimen               morphology over time during various biological processes.",
