 "awd_abstract_narration": "From satellite images to elementary school textbooks, our                       everyday life is full of information presented in the form of                   images. Since so much information is in non-alphanumeric form, as               a natural extension of the ideas in databases, researchers                      started exploring the design and implementation of image                        databases. The progress in this area requires close interaction                 among researchers from disparate areas of computer science and                  other fields. To bring together active researchers in databases,                object-oriented systems, image and signal processing, multi-                    media, and other related areas a workshop will be organized. In                 addition to the researchers in the above and related areas, a few               researchers and practitioners interested in applying these                      systems in industry, health-care, global change and other areas                 will be invited. The practitioners will provide input into the                  discussion to guarantee that useful systems will be designed by                 researchers and practitioners working in this emerging area. The                participants will be drawn from academic institutions, research                 centers, Government, and industry.  The report of the workshop                  will be submitted to NSF and will be widely publicized.  The                    report will identify major research areas that should be                        addressed by researchers for designing user-friendly visual                     information management systems suitable for a wide range of                     application domains.",
