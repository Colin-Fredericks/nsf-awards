 "awd_abstract_narration": "A particular concern about the predicted global mean                            temperature increase of 1 to 5 Degrees C by the year 2050 is                    that in the tropics, where many organisms live near their upper                 thermal tolerance, even a small increase in temperature could                   result in wide-spread mortality of ecologically and/or                          economically important species with a consequent change in the                  composition and character of tropical ecosystems (Peters and                    Darling 1985).  Over the last decade there has been an                          increased incidence of so-called coral bleaching (Williams and                  Williams 1990, Langreth 1990, Glynn 1991), due to the loss by                   scleractinian corals of their algal symbionts or Hoegh-Guldberg                 and Smith 1989, Kleppel et al. 1989, Szmant and Gassman 1990).                  Many of the geographically extensive incidences of bleaching                    have followed periods of elevated seawater temperatures (Glynn                  1991) and bleaching has been attributed to temperature stress                   to either the coral animals and/or their zooxanthellae (which                   of the two is not known for certain).  The bleaching events                     have been taken by some to indicate that global climate warming                 has already begun (Roberts 1990), and temperature-sensitive                     coral reef cnidarians are being touted as potential important                   as indicators of small but real recent increases in seawater                    temperatures.                                                                                                                                                   Our ability to causally associate coral bleaching with global                   temperature increases is hampered by our lack of understanding                  of the fundamental causes and processes of the bleaching                        (Gladfelter 1988.  Little is known about the particular                         conditions that trigger adaptive response to temperature                        increase.  This information is needed to able to interpret                      coral bleaching from a global warming perspective, as well as                   to predict the long-term consequences of such warming.                                                                                                          I hereby propose that the detection of heat-shock gene                          expression in tropical cnidarians and their algal symbionts may                 be a viable method for learning more about the temperature                      tolerance, physiology and adaptation of these organisms, and                    potentially as a monitoring tool for detecting climate change.",
