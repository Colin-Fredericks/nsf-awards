Recently, a new generation of                                                   algorithms that change form and                                                 structure during the computation                                                procedure (adaptive) have been                                                  introduced in order to address                                                  issues of accuracy and efficiency of                                            numerical simulations.  Based on the                                            initial success of adaptive                                                     algorithms in computational                                                     mechanics it is highly desirable                                                that those schemes be extended to                                               applications in other areas of                                                  engineering.  One such area is                                                  semiconductor device modeling.  One                                             of the best \"tools\" for numerical                                               simulation of charge transport in                                               semiconductor devices is the                                                    hydrodynamic model, which has the                                               advantage over the widely used                                                  drift-diffusion formalism of                                                    providing average carrier energy                                                throughout the structure.  Such                                                 information is essential in                                                     improving physically based models of                                            semiconductor device phenomena (e.g.                                            improved models for velocity                                                    overshoot, impact ionization, etc.)                                             Unfortunately, the hydrodynamic                                                 approach may be quite expensive for                                             routine device simulations when used                                            in conjunction with conventional                                                numerical algorithms.  Here,                                                    adaptive algorithms will be employed                                            in order to increase the efficiency                                             and accuracy of the hydrodynamic                                                model for device simulation.                                                    Solutions of the hydrodynamic                                                   equations may be quite sensitive to                                             model parameters such as momentum                                               and energy relaxation times.                                                    Promising numerical algorithms are                                              more quickly adopted by the device                                              modeling community when they are                                                demonstrated using physically                                                   reasonable and reliable model.  An                                              important feature of the proposed                                               program addresses the need for doing                                            model develop in concert with                                                   algorithm development.  This                                                    research program has been designed                                              to bring together the backgrounds                                               and talents of a numerical methods                                              specialist and a semiconductor                                                  device engineer.",
