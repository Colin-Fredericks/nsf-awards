 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project on nanocrystalline materials has three                             primary objectives.  First, the spark erosion                                   technique for producing nanoparticles of a very                                 wide range of materials will be investigated and                                optimized for maximum yield of the desired particle                             sizes and compositions.  Second, a variety of                                   nanoparticle systems representing superconducting,                              magnetic and structural properties will be                                      extensively characterized.  Third, the consolidation                            of the nanoparticles into macroscopic samples                                   retaining the unusual properties of the precursors,                             utilizing dynamic extrusion and shock consolidation                             as well as conventional processing methods, will be                             implemented.  Using liquid dielectics, the spark                                erosion technique has been shown to yield high                                  purity particles of metals, alloys, oxides, carbides,                           and semiconductors in sizes from nanometers to                                  micrometers at significant production rates.  Sparks                            erosion may be carried out also in ultrapure gases.                             This approach increases the performance of this                                 method in the synthesis, treatment and subsequent                               handling of nanoparticles.  The characterization of                             various types of nanoparticles produced will involve                            diffraction (x-ray, electron, neutron), high resolution                         TEM, surface analysis, as well as methods                                       particularly suited to specific systems such as                                 optical and Mossbauer spectroscopy, transport                                   measurements and magnetic properties.                                                                                                                           Research is planned to demonstrate and extend the                               capabilities of the spark erosion method to produce                             economically significant quantities of various types                            of nanoparticles, as well as to investigate some of                             the unique properties of these systems in                                       particulate and consolidated form.",
