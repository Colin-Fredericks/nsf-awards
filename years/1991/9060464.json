 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed research concerns a new category of educational tools             to which we have given the generic name \"Classroom Communication                Systems.\"  Classroom Communication Systems are computer based                   communication tools for teachers and students in the classroom, and             in many respects are fundamentally unpretentious in their                       aspirations.  Nevertheless in early testing in large first year                 college Physics and Engineering classes prototype systems have                  shown that they are capable of producing remarkable results.                    Students report that they understand the subject better, enjoy                  class more, and work harder.  The Professor who has pioneered the               pedagogy for using the systems reports that his large class seems               much smaller, and that the atmosphere in the class is substantially             improved.  The ultimate objective of the proposed research program              is to determine whether Classroom Communication Systems are capable             of producing something close to a small group Socratic environment              even in a large classroom.  The work focuses on scientific,                     engineering and mathematics instruction at a range of educational               levels.                                                                                                                                                         The specific objectives for Phase I include generalizing the                    prototype question structure, selecting and/or modifying an                     appropriate pedagogical framework for use with such systems,                    conducting limited tests based on this work, in college level                   Physics Classes.",
