 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lake Forest College seeks funds for a two and                                   one-half-year program to develop 40 mathematics/computer                        science leader-teachers in high schools across the                              nation.  The program will consist of two six-week summer                        institutes of intensive course work in mathematics,                             computer science, pedagogy and leadership training; team                        classroom projects which will serve as models for                               inservice programs; and follow-up activities during the                         intervening school year which include a two-day                                 miniconference, telecommunication among staff and                               participants, and classroom visitations.                                                                                                                        Participants will have strong backgrounds in mathematics                        and computer science and may earn 18 hours of graduate                          credit.  The three senior staff from Lake Forest have                           good backgrounds in mathematics, mathematics education, and                     computer science.  Three Presidential Award winning high                        school teachers will act as role models and mentors.                            Visiting consultants in mathematics education will                              complete the staff.  Mathematics topics will include real                       analysis and chaos; discrete mathematics and                                    combinatorics; and linear programming.  Computer science                        topics will include data structures in Pascal; and                              language, automata and theory of computation.  It is                            expected that about 400 second-wave teachers will                               participate in inservice activities conducted by the                            first-wave participants.  Lake Forest College's cost-                           sharing accounts for 9% of the NSF budget.                                                                                                                      The student of the 21st Century will need a proficiency                         in both computer science and mathematics and must be able                       to use the one to enhance the other.  This program will                         train 40 lead-teachers nationally with a proficiency in                         both computer science and mathematics, capable of                               teaching such students and of enhancing other teachers.",
