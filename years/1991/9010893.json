The                study analyzes a computerized corpus of 1,500 texts (3,000,000                  words), representing 17 speech-based and written registers.  The                computational techniques and large corpus allow analyzing change                along multiple parameters of variation and uncovering patterns of               greater scope, accuracy, and reliability than would be possible                 otherwise.  Specific undertakings will be:  1.  descriptions of                 the linguistic characteristics of speech-based and written                      registers in English for each of the last four centuries; 2.                    diachronic analyses of the changes within and among these                       registers; 3.  comparison of developments across British and                    American English; and 4.  'explanations' of the observed                        developments in terms of changes in social attitudes,                           demographics, and purposes of communication (including the                      expanded range of uses for written language).                                                                                                                        Although numerous studies have analyzed differences between                speech and writing in English, apart from the earlier work by the               PIs no study has analyzed differences in earlier periods or                     traced the linguistic evolution of written styles.  The research                advances the multi-feature/multi-dimensional model of variation                 developed in their earlier studies.  This model provides an                     empirical basis for analyzing the evolution of registers in                     relation to the expansion of literacy uses in English; and it                   lays a foundation for cross-linguistic comparisons, thus enabling               investigation of universal tendencies of register development                   over time.",
