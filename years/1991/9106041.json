 "awd_abstract_narration": "The retroviruses HTLV-1 and HTLV-II are distinguished from                      many other RNA tumor viruses because they encode regulatory                     proteins that interact with the host cell RNA synthesis                         machinery.  One of these proteins, the tax gene product                         activates transcription via a target sequence located                           upstream of the RNA synthesis iniation site in the proviral                     LTR.  The principal objectives of the present work are to                       elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying tax                                transactivation and to identify the specific cellular                           proteins that interact with the tax gene product.                               Functional Tax protein will be purified from eukaryotic cells                   infected with a recombinant  baculovirus vector.  It will be                    determined whether purified Tax protein binds to or modified                    any of the previously purified cellular transcription factors                   that interact with the HTLV-1 LTR, including NF-1, HEF-1T,                      and various other proteins that bind in or near three 21 bp                     sequence repeats present in the target region.  Binding will                    be measured directly in coprecipitation and electrophoretic                     mobility shift assays.  In addition, Tax will be incubated                      with preparations of purified cellular transcription factors                    to determine whether any of the polypeptides present in these                   preparations are released from multisubunit complexes or                        otherwise modified.                                                             In separate experiments, purified Tax protein will be added                     to nuclear extracts from uninfected cells in an attempt to                      develop a Tax-responsive system for in vitro transcription of                   the HTLV proviral promoter.  As a complementary approach,                       anti-Tax antibody will be prepared and added to Tax-                            containing reactions in an attempt to block transcription by                    steric interference.  In addition, a Tax protein affinity                       column will be prepared and tested for its ability to deplete                   nuclear extracts of general and promoter-selective                              transcription factors.                                                          Finally, structure-function studies of Tax protein will be                      initiated.  These will include characterization of the                          differences between Tax protein from HTLV-1 and HTLV-II,                        using the transcription and protein binding assays described                    above.  Also, these studies will include characterization of                    a mutant that alters the transactivation specificity of HTLV-                   I tax to that of HTLV-II tax, two deletion mutants that are                     transactivation negative, and a mutant that is a                                transdominant inhibitor of HTLV-II tax.  Methods of scaling-                    up tax expression will also be developed, with the ultimate                     objective of producing Tax protein in quantities and purity                     necessary for physical and structural studies.",
