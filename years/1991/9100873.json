 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site grant.                   The award permits undergraduate students to participate in a                    research program in the materials field under the supervision of                faculty members actively engaged in research.  The Cornell                      program  emphasizes significant recruitment and participation of                minorities and females, as well as representation from                          universities nationwide.  The program lasts ten weeks in the                    summer, and includes instruction in the use of libraries, search                of electronic data bases, research in teams composed of                         undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and faculty                       members, planning of experiments, use of instrumentation for                    research on polymer-based fibers, data analysis, oral                           presentation of results in a university-wide seminar.  Research                 undertaken includes fiber chemistry, biomedical textiles, high                  performance fibers, composite materials, liquid crystal polymers,               and dye chemistry.  Funding is provided for six students.  The                  program enhances current research activities as well as adding to               the number of scientifically trained individuals.  It is hoped                  that this hands-on experience will serve as a stimulus to                       attract and retain highly-gifted students into careers in                       teaching and research.",
