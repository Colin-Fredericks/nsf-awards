Capitalizing on ten years experience in the development,                        publication and dissemination of materials on air quality                       issues, and the network already established between                             scientists, educators, teachers and students, GLOBE-NET will                    create, evaluate, and prepare materials for publication                         which are bias-free and scientifically and educationally                        sound, taking into account findings of research scientists                      in subject areas and current research on how students learn                     science.                                                                                                                                                        These materials will be designed to be infused into existing                    and established courses and study in life, earth, physical,                     environment sciences, biology, chemistry, physics and other                     science curricula.  Dealing with global environmental                           changes these materials will provide hands-on experiences,                      cooperative and inquiry learning and other research-based                       strategies.  The materials will meet the standards of the                       National Diffusion Network and will be published Carolina                       Academic Press and disseminated by Carolina Biological                          Supply Company and others.                                                                                                                                      This project will translate and transfer the most current                       information on this vital topic - to teachers to students                       and ultimately to the general public.  GLOBE-NET will help                      teachers, students and parents learn more about science and                     will lead toward an informed citizenry that is cognizant of                     scientific issues of major international concern.                                                                                                               Cooperators from the SCI-LINK Project, supported by the                         National Science Foundation, include personnel from local,                      state and federal government agencies, universities and                         corporations, many students and teachers from different                         schools.  GLOBE-NET is a joint project of the Colleges of                       Agriculture and Life Sciences, Physical and Mathematics                         Sciences, Forest Resources, Education and Ecology, and                          Behavioral Biology, University of Minnesota.",
