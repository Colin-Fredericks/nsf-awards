 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chronic malnutrition affects children living in poverty and can                 result in deficits in cognitive development and limit school                    performance.  As such, chronic malnutrition in childhood                        positively correlates with later health, growth attained and                    economic success as an adult.  Child development may be modified                by a number of factors other than malnutrition, including                       aspects of family life.  This research will investigate the                     relationship between insufficient nutrition, poverty, school                    performance and the mechanisms by which family practices can                    mediate these effects.  Multiple measures of childhood                          functioning will be utilized to validate the results.  The study                site will be in rural Belize.  It is hypothesized that 1)                       children exhibiting the effects of chronic undernutrition will                  perform less well by a number of criteria than the better                       nourished; 2) that, while children of higher socioeconomic status               will perform better than the lower SES children,  3) within an                  SES children whose families provide stimulation will perform                    better than others.   Both general and local practices which                    contribute to social and intellectual development will be                       documented.",
