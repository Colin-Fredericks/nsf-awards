 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for biological production                   in the ocean.  Diagenetic processing and burial efficiency of P                 in marine sediments exert a major control on marine                             biogeochemical cycles.  Over geologic time, the level of P in                   the ocean will be controlled to a large extent by its rate of                   burial in marine sediments.  This is crucial to the development                 of realistic, predictive, biogeochemical models and to the                      interpretation of the sedimentary record.  Detailed solid-phase                 p data, generated using a new selective sequential extraction                   (SEDEX) technique, will be collected for a diverse suite of                     typical marine environments and one river-estuary-delta system                  (the Mississippi).  Phase s responsible for P retention by                      marine sediments will be identified by examining solid-phase P                  redistribution with depth in sediments in conjunction with pore                 water and other solid-phase data.  This approach provides                       insight into the early diagenetic chemical reactions                            responsible for formation and preservation of these phases.                     Diagenetic modeling will be used to test interpretations made                   on the basis of solid-phase and pore water data and to draw                     further conclusions as to rates of the chemical processes                       inferred.  Comparison of the quantity and chemical nature of                    solid-phase P to pore water gradients over fine-scale (mm)                      depth intervals near the sediment-water interface will permit                   quantification and characterization of P cycling and burial                     efficiency near this interface.  The extent of biogeochemical                   processing of particulate P during transit across a particular                  continent-ocean interface will be quantified by comparing                       solid-phase P speciation in Mississippi River/Estuary suspended                 matter with that in associated deltaic sediments.  Depositional                 environmental controls on P burial will be generated from which                 to construct a global marine P budget.",
