 "awd_abstract_narration": "The decades following the US Civil War saw the most creative period             of institution building in the history of the House of                          Representatives.  This innovative research seeks to draw explicit               links between this critical period of congressional history and                 the contemporary congress.  The institutional practices that                    developed during this period, such as the development of the                    seniority principle and the development of the differentiated                   committee system loom large in the contemporary congress.                       Understanding the origins and early dynamics of these institutions              can provide insights into the operation of the contemporary house.                                                                                              Specifically this project provides a comprehensive accounting of                organizational change in the House of Representatives from 1870 to              1946. Data will be collected on the committee system during the                 period and will be augmented with data on member characteristics                and on the political system more generally.                                                                                                                     When completed this research not only will shed light on                        congressional politics during an important and formative period of              American history but also will help us evaluate contemporary                    political theories about collective choice.",
