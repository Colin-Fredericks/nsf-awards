Gibson of the                  Chemistry Department, University of Louisville, for studies of                  bimetallic complexes of late transition metals.  Complexes                      bridged by small oxycarbon ligands, such as dioxymethylene, and                 carbon dioxide, will be synthesized and characterized.  These                   complexes are models for species which have been suggested as                   intermediates in catalytic conversions of carbon monoxide or                    carbon dioxide to ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, and other                      oxygenated products.  The synthesis will be followed by studies                 of the reactions of the bimetallic compounds, including carbon                  monoxide, carbon dioxide, and formaldehyde insertion reactions,                 reaction with electrophiles, and thermolysis reactions.                         Crystallographic structures will be determined where possible.                  %%%                                                                             Although \"syngas\", a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen,                   has long been been processed commercially to produce                            hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing organic compounds using                      catalytic methods, the details of the processes are not                         completely understood.  The catalysts used contain cobalt,                      iron, ruthenium and other transition metals.  Because it is                     desirable to have more control over the distribution of                         products and to effect the conversions at lower temperatures,                   it is important to probe the details of this chemistry in order                 to develop improved or alternative methods.  In this project,                   some bimetallic compounds which been suggested as models for                    intermediates in the production of ethylene glycol and related                  products will be prepared and characterized with the goal of                    understanding the factors which affect their reactivity.",
