 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to formulate strategies for              resource allocation, control and pricing in communication networks              that offer multiple services using shared resources. It is                      expected that these problems will become significant as networks                continue to integrate diversified services.  The Principal                      Investigator is modeling such a multiple service, multiple                      resource system, analyzing strategies for managing the system                   through control of service requests and pricing of services, and                designing a set of algorithms to specify these strategies.  The                 initial part of the research uses existing theories of Markov                   chains; the latter part draws from a richer domain of stochastic                processes.  The effort exposes issues and strategies for managing               communication networks in particular, and contributes to modeling               and analysis of any multiple service, multiple resource system in               general.  The research will be evaluated by the information                     content of the resulting control and pricing rules and by the                   complexity of the resulting algorithms.",
