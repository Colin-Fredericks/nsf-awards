 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is part of a coordinated project to document and                    maintain special-purpose computer codes which can be used                       to study different aspects of the runup of a tsunami (seismic                   sea wave) onto a coastline.  It involves a collaboration                        between Professor Philip Liu at Cornell University, and                         Professors Kobayashi and Grilli at the University of                            Delaware.                                                                                                                                                       Quite a large number of special-purpose computer programs                       have been developed as part of student doctoral theses.                         Some of these codes were later found to have wider                              applicability, and are of interest to other researchers.  At the                time that they were developed, the substantial investment in                    effort and time needed to document them for general usage                       was not made.  There is now a growing recognition of this                       need, but there are no agreed-upon standards for such                           documentation.  This project is intended as a pilot study for                   documenting and maintaining three existing computer                             programs.  The objective is to develop guidelines for                           documentation and maintenance of such large computer                            codes, thereby defining a standard which other code                             developers can follow.                                                                                                                                          This action is for the work by Professors Kobayashi and                         Grille at the University of Delaware's Center for Applied                       Coastal Research.  Professor Grilli's code solves the exact                     two-dimensional nonlinear potential flow equations, for                         arbitrary bottom geometry, and can be used for short                            wavelengths (e.g. wind waves) and long wavelengths (e.g.                        tsunamis).  Professor Kobayashi's code calculates the one-                      dimensional nonlinear long wave runup on an impermeable                         slope of arbitrary geometry and roughness characteristics.",
