Milne and Johnson will use the theory of phase transitions to              study the origin, maintenance, and dynamics of broad-scale                      vegetation patterns in semiarid lands of New Mexico, USA.  By                   definition, landscape phase transitions exhibit power-law behavior              in the number of patches of woodland when the landscape changes                 from grassland to woodland.  Two other characteristics, including               the length of patches and the probability that a shrub resides in               a continuous cluster of shrubs, also vary as powers of total                    woodland cover.  Related power laws are predicted that describe the             resilience of the system to disturbance.  These studies will                    account for the effects of climatic teleconnection, elevation,                  slope aspect, soil texture, and land use.  Models will be                       constructed to: (1) test that pinyon-juniper woodland ecotones                  exhibit characteristics of true phase transitions; (2) assess the               equlibrium vs. nonequilibrium nature of ecotones. (3) investigate               changes in vegetation patterns under possible climate change                    scenarios; and (4) use renormalization relations to express                     predictions of landscpae change at coarser levels of resolution.                In summary, this project presents an approach for detecting                     ecological responses to environmental change.  These investigators              are leading scientists in the area of quantitative landscape                    ecology.  Institutional facilities for conducting this research are             outstanding.",
