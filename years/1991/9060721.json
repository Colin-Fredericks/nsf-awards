 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electrical and material properties of high temperature                      superconducting (HTSC) thin films have improved dramatically in                 recent months.  However, a fabrication process capable of                       producing Josephson junctions in finite yields has yet to be                    developed.  Some demonstration devices have been made which                     indicate that the 77 K noise levels of dc SQUIDs made from                      thallium-barium-calcium-copper-oxide are low enough for many                    applications.  Unfortunately, a basic understanding of the                      processing protocol needed to reproducibly achieve suitable I-V                 characteristics is lacking.  The objective of this Phase I                      program is to establish the basic processing technology required                for reliable weak link fabrication in thallium-boricum-calcium-                 copper-oxide.  A novel approach will be investigated which takes                advantage of the high volatility of thallium oxide.  The current-               voltage characteristics of the weak links will be measured and                  optimum processing conditions developed.  These results will                    establish the feasibility of reproducibly fabricating links in                  microbridges of thallium-barium-calcium-copper-oxide.  These                    results will provide the key component required to fabricate                    active HTSC devices such as SQUIDS and microwave mixers in the                  Phase II Program.",
