 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator and a graduate                  student will work on several interesting problems involving                     partial differential equations that arise in various                            applications. Among other things, they will study ill-posed                     problems, St. Venant and Phragmen-Lindelof problems, stability                  questions for nonlinear systems and overdetermined problems.                    This work will be characterized by a deft use of analytical                     techniques such as a' priori estimates and maximum principles to                derive sharp bounds on physically relevant quantities that are                  described by ill-posed problems.                                                     Important physical phenomena are described by what are                     called \"ill-posed\" problems, to which the tried and true methods                of mathematics often do not apply.  These are problems that can                 have more than one solution or no solution at all and whose                     solutions, if they exist, exhibit strange behavior.  Most                       problems in partial differential equations are \"well-posed\", by                 which mathematicians mean that there is a unique solution that                  depends continuously on the data of the problem.  In this project               the principal investigator and a graduate student will apply                    mathematical methods to study the behavior of solutions of ill-                 posed problems that come from physics and engineering.",
