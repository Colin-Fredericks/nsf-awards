 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on developing models for evaluating hierarchal                 testability of circuits.  Three topics are being pursued.  First,               stochastic models for circuit structure, used for obtaining                     analytical expressions of controllability and observability, are                being explored.  New testability metrics and fast testability                   evaluation of IC's based on the stochastic models are being                     investigated.  Second, a unified framework for expressing                       hierarchal testability metrics is being established.  This allows               representation of any testability metric for the purpose of                     hierarchal testability analysis.  Formal methods of composing                   testability metrics are being developed.  Third, efficient                      algorithms for doing the partitioning for testability are being                 designed and evaluated.  Central to the approach is the development             of a discrete hazard function that quantifies for each level in a               circuit the difficulty to fault propagation exhibited by the                    circuit structure.",
