 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Minority Research Planning Grant project is supported                      through the Office of Special Projects and the Synthetic                        Organic Chemistry Program in Chemistry.  It involves a study of                 the important role that cyclopropanes play in organic                           synthesis.  The cyclopropane ring system lends itself to many                   synthetically useful rearrangements and appears as part of a                    number of natural products.  While these compounds have been                    extensively studied, there is still a good deal of active                       research continuing on the syynthesis and chemistry of                          cyclopropanes.  This project involves new routes for the                        synthesis of highly substituted cyclopropanes and for formation                 of highly reactive cyclopropane intermediates generated via                     carbene chemistry.                                                              %%%                                                                             Minority Research Planning Grants are intended to strengthen                    the proposal writing and planning capabilities of new                           investigators and to facilitate preliminary studies and other                   planning activities related to the research.  This project is                   that of a chemist who has moved to an academic career after a                   brief experience in industry.",
