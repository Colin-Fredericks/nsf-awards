 "awd_abstract_narration": "Block copolymers enjoy increasing use in a wide range of materials              applications, due primarily to properties derived from the                      thermodynamic interactions between blocks.  With increasing chain               length and/or interaction strength, block copolymer liquids undergo             an order-disorder transition (ODT) to a microstructured state.                  Although much has been learned about the accessible morphologies in             the strong-segregation limit, i.e., well into the ordered state,                the behavior in the vicinity of the ODT, i.e., the weak-segregation             limit, is much less understood.  We will use a powerful optical                 technique, oscillatory flow birefringence (OFB), to both diagnose               and characterize the ODT and associated order-order transitions.                In addition, extensive calculations have shown that the dilute-                 solution OFB properties of block copolymers are uniquely sensitive              to the lengths and chain locations of the various blocks; both                  quantities are otherwise difficult to determine.  We will explore               the potential of OFB as a characterization tool for block                       copolymers, and in so doing assess the effect of the block-block                interaction on the relaxation spectrum.  Finally, the investigation             will be continued of the role of the solvent in conformational                  dynamics experiments such as OFB, both in terms of solvent dynamics             and solvent quality.  In particular, a remarkable relationship                  between solvent rotational relaxation and the high-frequency                    viscoelastic properties of polymer solutions will be examined                   further.",
