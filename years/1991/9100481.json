 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the study and analysis of building damage                                    after an earthquake, the total economic loss                                    incurred in a building can be determined for                                    various structural types based on field data.                                   However, little research work to date, if                                       any, has been accomplished to segregate                                         economic losses among various building                                          elements such as structural versus                                              nonstructural, mechanical, interior/exterior                                    finishes and cladding, etc.                                                                                                                                     This project focuses on filling this                                            knowledge gap by: (a) analyzing damage                                          patterns in actual buildings, (b) developing                                    a detailed classification of the types and                                      locations of typical building damage                                            patterns, and (c) quantifying losses among                                      the various subsystems of a building such as                                    the basic structure, exterior cladding,                                         interior finishes, mechanical components, and                                   other nonstructural elements which compose                                      the entire building system.  This research                                      will provide a specific mechanism for                                           differentiation and quantification of                                           subsystem damage patterns within the total                                      building system.  Results anticipated will                                      enhance our understanding and ability to                                        retain the proper balance between cost and                                      risk in the seismic design of architectural                                     components and systems.",
