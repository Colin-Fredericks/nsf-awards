 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial fishing vessels use very large drift nets in                    which a variety of animals, including seabirds, become entangled                and die.  Drift nets may be a significant source of mortality for               some species, and Dr. Sievert Rohwer of the University of                       Washington has devised a method of estimating the degree to which               drift nets are diminishing sea bird population.  Observers from                 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will be accompanying                         commercial fishing ships from Japan, Taiwan, and Korea this                     coming year, and Dr. Rohwer has arranged for the seabirds                       harvested in their drift nets to be donated to the Burke Museum                 of the University of Washington for further study.                                   This program of specimen acquisition and curation will bring               new Pacific seabird species to light, and will allow ecologists                 to determine the species that are most affected by drift nets.                  Ecologists will be able to ascertain the age distribution of                    birds killed in this manner.  This information will help in the                 formulation of fishing policies, and the design of management                   plans for threatened or endangered species.",
