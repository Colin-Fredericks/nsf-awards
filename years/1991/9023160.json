 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the effects of similarity on individual                    judgement and choice.  Three sets of experiments are proposed.                  The first set of experiments investigates multiattribute stimuli                with similar levels along one dimension and dissimilar levels on                another.  The hypothesis that similarity along one dimension will               enhance differences along another dimension is tested.  The                     second set of experiments investigates the effect of the stimulus               range on attribute importance.  The hypothesis that similarity                  along a stimulus dimension will decrease the importance of that                 dimension is tested.  The third set of studies examines                         similarity between stimulus and response scales and tests the                   conjecture that when a stimulus dimension is more closely related               to the response scale, that stimulus will receive greater weight                to the extent that it is perceived to be more valid.  When the                  validity of the stimulus is unconfounded with response scale                    similarity, the more valid cue is weighted more heavily.                                                                                                        By contributing to a better understanding of how individuals                    evaluate multiattribute items, this project may lead to more                    realistic models of individual valuation for use in decision                    making, marketing and voting.                                                    ***//",
