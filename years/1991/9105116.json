 "awd_abstract_narration": "Purine nucleotides have a multi-functional role in cellular                     metabolism.  For example, they are directly involved in                         kinase and ATPase reactions, they functin as regulators of                      many allosteric enzymes, they are involved (through the                         effects of cyclic AMP) in the action of several hormones,                       they contribute to the aggregation of platelets, and they                       participate in dehydrogenase reactions as part of the                           coenzyme molecule.  The immediate aim of this study is to                       develop the tools which will allow  systematic exploration of                   the amino acid residues in the purine nucleotide sites of                       proteins.  The general approach of affinity labeling will be                    used based on reagents previously synthesized in this                           laboratory as well as on new reagents which incorporate, at                     various positions of the purine or ribose ring, alkylating                      agents capable of reacting covalently with the protein; the                     purine nucleotide moiety will thus provide the specificity                      for chemical modification of the proteins within the binding                    sites.  The effects of these nucleotide alkylating agents on                    the rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase as well as on the rat liver                   ecto-ATPase will be examined.  The aggregation of blood                         platelets is induced by ADP, presumably by binding to                           receptor sites on the platelet surface membrane.  Affinity                      labeling with the purine nucleotide analogues will be used to                   identify and isolate the ADP receptor protein of platelet                       membranes.  Further, the effects of reactive cAMP derivatives                   on the platelet cAMP phosphodiesterase will be explored.  For                   each enzyme, the kinetics of the affinity labeling reaction                     will be examined, the extend of reagent incorporation will be                   determined and radioactive peptides will be isolated from                       proteolytic digests of labeled enzyme to identify the                           modified residue.  The first class of nucleotide analogues                      which we described, the fluorosulfonylbenzoyl nucleosides,                      has already been used to react at specific sites of more than                   50 proteins; it is likely that the newer compounds which we                     develop will similarly have broad applicability in the                          labeling of nucleotide sites in proteins and that these                         studies will serve as prototypes for the use of these                           compounds to probe other enzymes.",
