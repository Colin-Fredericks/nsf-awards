 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Missouri - Columbia for the repair and renovation of              Schlundt Annex so that it can house the research and research                   training programs in protein structure of the Biochemistry                      Department.  This building was constructed in 1940 and has not                  previously been renovated.  The ARFMP grant of $1,449,728 and                   $1,534,760 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to              modernize these research and research training facilities and                   permit a strong and coherent research group to be unified along                 with a transgenic plant facility in a contiguous research space.                This project will address the need to improve the current research              infrastructure by reconfiguring the space so that it is more                    functional, installing centralized air conditioning and heating and             the appropriate duct work, increasing electrical services,                      improving the access to all floors, upgrading the transgenic plant              facilities, and constructing laboratories to house the protein                  sequencing and peptide synthesis facility.                                                                                                                      This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students                 and postdoctoral fellows.  Students trained in these laboratories,              where there is a coherent grouping of strong faculty leadership                 surrounded by a configuration of pertinent facilities, will be able             to keep abreast of the latest developments in an important area of              biochemistry.",
