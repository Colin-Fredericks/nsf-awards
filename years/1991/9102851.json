 "awd_abstract_narration": "One tactic for potential improvement of Numerical Weather                  Forecasting (NWF)  is the timely incorporation of large bodies of               new observational data. These will become available from networks               of Doppler radars and other automated instrumental systems that are             to come on line throughout the remainder of this decade. The oppor-             tunity will be enhanced with the concurrent growth of computer                  data-handling power. Also, and just as important, will be recent                developments in applied mathematics, particularly in the theory of              optimal control. By the mathematical analysis of the equations (or              computational algorithms) governing the behaviour of evolving                   systems, it is possible to identify key values whose adjustment                 will minimize undesirable properties of the system. However, the                analysis becomes extremely difficult as the governing equations                 become complex, and even if it is successfully carried out, there               remains the problem of implementing its results quickly and cheaply             enough to be useful in practice. In the case of NWF, the procedure              can be applied to the problem of adjusting the initial meteorologi-             cal fields that start a forecast so that the differences between                the predictions of a numerical model and measurements coming in                 early in the forecast period are minimized. This is done by making              repeated trial predictions for a short period, while simulteneously             and repeatedly fine tuning the initial fields until the desired                 minimum error is found. The adjusted initial field is then used to              carry out the prediction over the full forecast period.                              The model of concern to the PIs is the workhorse operational               weather prediction model of the US National Meteorological Center               (NMC). In a grant just ending under the NSF-NMC Joint Program in                NWF they have successfuly constructed a set of algorithms (the                  \"adjoint model\") that complement the NMC computer program in such               a way that by alternately using the adjoint and prediction models               during the trial prediction period the number of iterations can be              significantly reduced. This has been characterized by the Director              of Development of NMC as a \"most significant achievement\". The                  proposed work is to exploit the breakthrough by further analysis of             the properties of the two models in order to achieve successful                 operational implementation of the theoretical findings. This could              enhance the accuracy of the weather forecasts to levels equal to or             exceeding those achieved at the European Center for Medium Range                Weather Forecasting, and increase the return on the national                    investment in the next-generation weather observing network.",
