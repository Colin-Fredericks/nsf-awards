 "awd_abstract_narration": "A preference-based approach to the problem of leader election in                distributed computer systems is examined.  This approach is based upon          the observation that a leader in a distributed system should represent          a \"good\" choice for the system from a performance standpoint.                   Individual nodes \"vote\" for different candidate nodes based upon                locally available information.  The votes are combined using an                 election scheme to determine the leader.                                             To develop and test this approach, it is planned to investigate            its application to the problem of leader election in two specific               system models:  the delay model and the reliability model.  Both,               experimental and theoretical, techniques to develop and study                   different leader election schemes are used.                                          The preference-based approach is of considerable practical                 interest and importance.  Voting represents an efficient way by which           to use locally available information to make a global decision that             reflects the preferences of indididual nodes.  Thus, the preference-            based approach is not merely a solution to the problem of leader                election; it represents, a generalized framework in which solutions to          problems of choice may be developed.",
