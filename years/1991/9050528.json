 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry will purchase a Mass                                Spectrometer/Gas Chromatograph (GC/MS) for the undergraduate                    laboratory.  This project will significantly improve the                        education of undergraduates in chemistry by integrating a mass                  spectrometer with gas chromatographic interface into the                        undergraduate chemistry laboratory curriculum at the University                 of Georgia.  Students need hands-on experience with this                        increasingly important tool for chemical research.  This                        instrument is ideal for teaching and demonstrating many                         fundamental chemical principles.  In the honors freshman                        program, mass spectra will demonstrate the simple concepts of                   isotopes, isomers, ionization potentials, and electron                          affinities.  In upper division analytical, organic, and                         inorganic labs for chemistry majors, more in-depth studies will                 probe the increased versatility and sensitivity provided for                    separations as well as both qualitative and quanitative                         analyses.  Physical chemistry applications will focus on the                    energetics and mechanisms of gas phase ion chemistry.  To                       insure the widest possible use of this equipment, periodic                      short courses on mass spectrometry will be offered as well as                   regularly scheduled access to the instrument for nearby college                 faculty and students.  The experiments developed here will be                   disseminated by development of laboratory manuals, presentation                 at meetings, and publication in journals. Overall, students                     will gain practical experience with important equipment and                     ideas in a way which should stimulate their interest in the                     critically important discipline of chemistry.",
