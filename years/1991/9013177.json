 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports collaborative interactions between                          scientists in the Department of Physics, Iowa State University,                 led by Professor Douglas K. Finnemore, and Professor Harald                     W. Weber and colleagues of the Atomic Institute of the                          Austrian Universities, in Vienna.  The two groups have been                     studying the anisotropy of the magnetic properties and                          current carrying capacity of high temperature superconductors.                  Their goal is to develop bulk superconducting materials which                   will carry a high critical current and thus be suitable for                     conductor material in large magnets.  Their cooperative work                    plan relies heavily on their complementary expertise and                        facilities.  The Iowa State University group is very                            experienced in the theory of anisotropic superconductors, in                    sample preparation for grain oriented materials, in measure-                    ments of the vortex line energy and in the study of pinning                     potentials for vortex motion.  The Austrian group has great                     experience with radiation damage in superconductors and                         highly accurate studies of the fundamental magnetization                        properties of these highly anisotropic materials                                                                                                                The U.S. group at Iowa State University will prepare the                        grain oriented crystal samples, measure their basic properties                  and arrange for their irradiation at several U.S. accelerator                   facilities.  The Austrian group will measure the magnetic and                   structural properties of these materials using different                        magnetization instruments (including their 17 tesla magnetiza-                  tion apparatus.)  There will also be a thorough study of the                    damage done by the ion tracks using transmission electron                       spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                                   The development of an understanding of anisotropy effects                       for flux pinning in high temperature superconductors would                      have both fundamental and practical implications.  Classical                    superconductors are highly isotropic compared to the high                       temperature materials, so the experiments proposed here are in                  a new regime where dimensionality and topology play a more                      important role. In addition, there is a large payoff for the                    development of new materials and new processing methods to                      produce conductors with higher critical current density                         values.  There is at present no satisfactory conductor                          material for magnetics because the mechanical properties and                    the transport critical currents are so poor.  Thus, any                         improvement in the critical current carrying capacity of the                    high temperature bulk superconductors would have a large                        impact on the availability of new magnets and new shielding                     materials.",
