 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue long-term studies of response and                    recovery of Southern Appalachian forested ecosystems to                         disturbances. To understand and predict responses to current and                emerging environmental problems requires an expansion of research               perspective from a watershed to a landscape. The project will                   emphasize new studies along a complex environmental gradient with               a continued emphasis on use of experimental manipulation to examine             ecosystem response to disturbance. An elevational sequence that                 represents a gradient in external driving variables (e.g.                       temperature, precipitation) as well as a gradient in ecosystem                  response will be used in this study.  Three interconnected                      ecosystems are arrayed along this response gradient: forested                   slopes, riparian zone and stream.  The PIs will test the following              ideas in these landscape components: (1) Forest structure and                   processes in the Southern Appalachians are currently changing as                a result of both historic factors and recent drought-induced tree               mortality. (2) Differences in structural and functional                         characteristics of stream ecosystems along elevational and                      longitudinal gradients are a consequence of changes in the relative             abundance of geomorphic patch types along the stream. (3)                       Rhododendron maximum is a keystone species in the Southern                      Appalachian landscape, regulating the rates of soluble and                      particulate element export from the forest and reducing stream                  productivity.                                                                                                                                                   This is an outstanding research group that is recognized at the                 national and international level as leaders in the area of forest               ecosystem research.  Institutional support is excellent and the                 project management is dynamic and effect. Coweeta Hydrologic                    Laboratory has been the site of interdisciplinary ecological                    research for over twenty years. This is an exceptional Long-Term                Ecological Research (LTER) project.//",
