 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced undergraduate student training in astronomy will be                    carried out by providing students with real research experience                 using a large modern observatory equipped with research-quality                 instrumentation.  A laboratory and analysis environment will be                 provided for specific astronomy undergraduate course offerings at               the University of Washington.  This environment will allow students             to acquire scientific data and will provide them with the tools to              evaluate this data using current astronomical techniques.  The                  goals of this program are to attract undergraduate students to                  astronomy and space science fields and to encourage them in                     developing their investigative talents.                                                                                                                         The program intends to create this environment and efficiently                  achieve these goals by taking advantage of many standards from                  industry as well as implementing standard astronomical data                     acquisition and analysis tools.  Many of these standards exist as               the successful products of past and continuing programs supported               by the National Science Foundation.                                                                                                                             The staff and observatory facilities of the University of                       Washington, which has a broad coverage in scientific, instructional             and engineering support, form an ideal platform upon which to base              the program.",
