 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is necessary for the normal development               and survival of nerve cells in the peripheral and central nervous               system.  The cellular mechanisms through which NGF elicits its                  effects are unknown.  The discovery of a protein kinase, which is               activated by NGF, may play an important role as a transducer of                 signals derived from NGF's interaction with cell receptors.  Dr.                Landreth has previously characterized and purified this protein                 kinase known as MAP2 by the enzyme's ability to phosphorylate                   microtubule associated protein 2.  This research project will                   determine how the protein kinase is activated.  It has been                     established that MAP2 kinase is activated through phosphorylation               by an unidentified kinase.  The mechanism of MAP2 kinase                        activation will be investigated by transfecting PC12 cells with                 oncogenes that encode kinases for the amino acids serine and                    threonine.  The biological function of MAP2 kinase will be                      studied by creating mutant cells which lack MAP2 kinase.  This                  will be accomplished by utilizing antisense RNA or DNA molecules                which specifically block the synthesis of the MAP2 kinase.  This                examination will analyze whether kinase deficient cells respond                 to NGF by activation of other protein kinases.  Results from this               study will provide additional information on the function of NGF                in the nervous system.",
