 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines a number of problems associated with                 interior point methods for linear programming. It begins with the               observation that under certain conditions the affine scalding                   algorithm converges at a superlinear rate when applied to the                   feasibility problem.  Then every linear programming problem is                  approximated by a feasibility problem.                                               The main technical difficulties have to do with degeneracies               in linear programming problems.  With assumptions about problems                being nondegenerate results about superlinear convergence are                   proved, but superlinear convergence has been observed even in                   degenerate cases.  So what is actually required for superlinear                 convergence is not clear.                                                            Trying to accelerate affine scaling algorithms leads naturally             to questions about centers of polytopes.  The existence of a large              set of \"centers\" inside every polytope, except these equivalent to              simplicies is shown.  The affine scaling algorithm converges fast               when started at one of these general centers.  To discover means                of computing centers efficiently is a goal of this research.                         After finding ways of accelerating convergence, the questions              of how to perform each step efficiently is addressed.  The least                square problems will be solved by a preconditioned conjugate                    gradient algorithm.",
