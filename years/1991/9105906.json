 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                  will help the Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytech                    Institute acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used                 in research investigations in the following areas of chemistry:                 1) proteins (endothelin, alamethicin, gramicidin and                            ion-binding sites of lysozyme), 2) drug interactions with model                 oligonucleotides, 3) self-assembled inorganic double helicates                  4) ion channels in cell membranes 5) polyether antibiotics and                  6) enantioselective syntheses of organic molecules with                         biological activity.  The applications of the ten minor users                   include the study of inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis,                    glycoside antibiotics, and characterization of the structure                    and dynamics of natural and synthetic polymers.                                                                                                                 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                      useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.",
