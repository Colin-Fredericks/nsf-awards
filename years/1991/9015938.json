 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Italy award will support an international school--a                   combined workshop and seminar meeting--covering recent advances                 in the understanding of static, kinematic and dynamic aspects                   of crystal and molecular structure, as studied by crystal                       diffraction, spectroscopic and theoretical methods.  The school                 is being held at the Ettore Majorana Centre for Scientific                      Culture in Erice, Sicily, from May 30 to June 9, 1991 and is                    being organized by Professor Kenneth Trueblood of UCLA for the                  U.S. side and Professor Lodovico Riva di Sanseverino of the                     University of Bologna for Italy.  About 120 participants from a                 dozen or more countries are expected, the great majority of                     whom will be young faculty members or others who have recently                  received advanced degrees.  There will be about 20 lectures                     and 10 tutors to help in workshops and microsymposia.                                                                                                           During the last two decades, the amount of precise and accurate                 information about molecular structure has increased enormously.                 Much of this is the result of increased automation and precision                of data collection and analysis in crystal diffraction, but                     there have also been important advances in other experimental                   techniques for studying structure.  In addition, theory has                     progressed to a stage where some of the details of molecular                    structure can be predicted at a level comparable with that                      attained by experiment.  There have also been advances in the                   analysis of the kinematics and dynamics of molecules in                         crystals, as well as in their correlation with phase transforma-                tions and solid state reactions.  The present school intends                    to review past achievements, present projects, and future goals                 in the realm of crystal and molecular structure studies by                      diffraction and spectroscopic methods.  Particular emphasis                     will be placed on the description and understanding of atomic                   motion in molecules and in crystals, with relevance to physical                 properties, chemical reactivity, and phase transformations,                     including such topics as structure-correlation (using statistical               methods with the Cambridge Structural Database), polymorphism,                  and solid-state reactions.",
