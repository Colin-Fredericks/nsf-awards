 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problems of nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic stability are                         of considerable interest in the framework of geophysics                         as well as of fundamental importance in physics.  It is                         anticipated that combining the complementary expertise                          of U.S. and Soviet scientists will lead to significant                          results related to better understanding of the fundamental                      mechanisms by which the Earth's magnetic field as well                          as planetary and solar magnetic fields behave and are                           generated.                                                                                                                                                      This U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperative scientific workshop,                             organized by Dr. Susan Friedlander of the University of                         Illinois at Chicago and Dr. M. M. Vishik of the USSR                            Academy of Sciences' International Institute of Earthquake                      Prediction Theory and Mathematical Geophysics, will bring                       together distinguished scientists from the United States                        and the Soviet Union whose range of expertise covers                            applied mathematics, mathematical physics, astrophysics,                        and geophysics.  It is expected that this initial                               meeting will generate further long-term collaborative                           activities in this field.                                                                                                                                       This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine comple-                           mentary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                             mutual interest and competence in the field of basic                            scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,                      and mutuality of benefit.",
