 "awd_abstract_narration": "The composition of cuticular wax of plants is complex and                       incompletely known, and rather little is known of the biosynthesis              of this material(s).  Two of the seventeen loci known to be                     involved in biosynthesis of this wax in maize have been tagged with             transposable elements; these genes will be cloned and, using the                transposable element as a molecular probe, a study of the                       biosynthetic pathway (localization, structure, and regulation of                the gene products) undertaken.  Comparison of the events in maize               with those of Arabidopsis is planned; these studies should lead to              increased comprehension of the biochemical mechanisms involved in               the synthesis of these unique and biologically significant plant                lipids.                                                                                                                                                         The cuticular waxes of plants constitute the first barrier to the               environment and the stresses it imposes on plants, and thus these               waxes play an important role in plant survival.  The composition                of these waxes and the biosynthetic pathways by which they are                  formed are incompletely known. This project will make use of                    transposon-tagged cloned genes to examine the gene products of the              biosynthetic pathway and thus enlarge our understanding of it.//",
