 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for a small grant for exploratory research                (SGER): a pilot study of buried soils to attempt to detect                      mobilization of heavy trace metals, decalcification and                         podzolization that should have accompanied the nitric acid rain                 predicted by some scenarios of extraterrestrial impact at the                   Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.  A suitably complete sequence of                  buried soils across this geological boundary has been located and               sampled in Bug Creek, eastern Montana.  Analyses of selected                    paleosols will be performed by AA (major and trace elements),                   isotopic dilution mass spectrometry (for Pb) and Walkley-Black (for             organic carbon) techniques.  Petrographic studies also will be                  undertaken in order to complete documentation of the subsurface                 clayey (Bt) horizons and other paleoenvironmentally significant                 features of the paleosols.  Nitric acid rain would be indicated by              strong depletion of the paleosol at the boundary in Pb and other                heavy metal trace elements, compared to the depth function for                  these elements in paleosols above and below the boundary that are               otherwise similar petrographically, chemically and in burial                    history.  Should this research prove to indicate acid rain, then                full scale search of other sequences of paleosols across the                    Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary would be warranted.  Should this                   research be unsuccessful indicating acid rain, it may nevertheless              add paleoenvironmental information for reconstructing events at                 this place and time in Earth history.",
