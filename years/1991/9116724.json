 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to send the PI and two Philippino                  graduate students to the Philippines for approximately one month.               Last April the volcano Pinatubo, north of Manila on the island of               Luzon began erupting for the first time in 600 years.  All                      indications were that this was the beginning of a major eruptive                cycle which would endanger thousands of area residents including                the Americans stationed on Clark airforce base.  A major danger                 is posed by lahars, rapid mud flows that occur when recent                      volcanic ash and rock debris is mobilized by monsoon rains or                   other sources of water.  The PI is an expert on Philippine                      lahars, having studied them with NSF support for several years on               Mt. Mayon, and the two grad students have also had experience on                Mayon.  Their presence at Pinatubo during the actual eruption                   will be invaluable on two counts; valuable data and samples will                be obtained which could not be after the eruption ceases, and                   their knowledge and advice will important in limiting the loss of               life and property should the eruption continue as is expected.                  Therefore a small grant for experimental research (SGER) award of               $8,500 is recommended which will cover their airfare and some                   subsistance during their anticipated stay in the Philippines.",
