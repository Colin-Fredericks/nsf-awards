 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interdisciplinary undergraduate laboratory for robotics,                     machine vision and system integration is being developed to                     serve senior-level undergraduate students in Electrical                         Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.  The laboratory                         provides the students with hands-on experience in the state-of-                 the-art robotics and manufacturing technology for reinforcing                   the scientific and engineering principles learned in related                    lecture courses.  The laboratory consists of four experimental                  stations, including (1) desk-top CNC machine station, (2) robot                 and CNC machine integration station, (3) computer vision                        station, and (4) robot and vision integration station.  In                      addition, a computer-controlled linear conveyor is used for                     simulating a flexible manufacturing workcell.  Each station                     contains a PC-type computer with appropriate software.  The                     equipment supplements existing equipment currently available in                 the Robotics Laboratory of the Department of Electrical                         Engineering and is housed in a room of 900 sq.ft. located in                    the new Science, Engineering and Technology Building 11.  The                   experiments performed by students range from robot fundamentals                 to vision-based automated manufacturing.  The students are be                   required to develop software to coordinatively command the                      robot, CNC machine and other components to perform various                      tasks with the aid of sensing devices.  In addition, all                        students in the Departments of Electrical Engineering and                       Mechanical Engineering benefit from the laboratory in related                   lecture courses and their senior engineering capstone design                    project courses.",
