 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous formerly authoritarian regimes appear to be undergoing                 transitions to democratic government.  The process of                           democratization, however, is highly diverse.  Just as there are                 many different types of authoritarian regimes and different types               of democracies, there are many different paths from                             authoritarianism to democracy.  This award supports research on the             development of opposition parties in formerly one party political               systems.  It does so through intensive field studies of the                     development of opposition parties in Mexico.                                                                                                                    Specifically, this research uses interviews with urban political                elites to examine the nature and exercise of political power in                 Mexico, to assess the effectiveness of emergent opposition parties              in responding to the challenges of exercising local political                   power, and to assess the viability of ongoing democratization                   processes in Mexico.  Although focussed on Mexico, the results of               this research should have broader implications for the transition               to democracy of other non-communist, one party political systems.                                                                                               When completed, this project should contribute to our understanding             not only of the nature and viability of the democratization process             in Mexico but to the prospects more generally for developing                    opposition parties in one party states.",
