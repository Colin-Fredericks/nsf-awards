 "awd_abstract_narration": "The adaptation of populations to environmental change can                     occur at extremely fine scales.  Plants growing on heavy-metal                  soils can be genetically differentiated from neighboring plants                 growing only meters away on normal soils.  Such genetic                         isolation is the result of strong selective pressures by metals                 in the soil coupled with selection for reduced gene flow                        between plant populations that span mine boundaries.  In this                   proposal, it is asked whether the same processes that have                      given rise to population differentiation in plants can also                     cause differentiation in herbivore populations that use these                   plants.  The importance of herbivore mobility, feeding                          specialization and exposure to metals to the presence or                        absence of local adaptation will be examined.  Eight different                  insect species (4 specialist feeders and 4 generalists feeders                  - with difference dispersal abilities) that occur on plants                     both on and off mine tailings will be selected.  Egg progeny                    of female insects, from both mined and normal sites, will be                    collected for each species.  Eggs from these females will be                    split into two batches:  one batch will be placed on plants                     growing on heavy-metal soil while the other will be placed on                   nearby plants growing on normal soils.  Such reciprocal                         transfer experiments will allow determination if progeny from                   insects collected on metal soils  fare better than progeny of                   insects collected from normal soils on metal-contaminated                       plants.  If this is the case, then local adaptation has                         occurred.                                                                         If herbivores capable of using metal-containing plants are                    genetically-differentiated from those on nearby plant                           populations, then it is possible that herbivore populations in                  general may exist as patches of locally-adapted individuals                     that are responding to small scale changes in plant quality.                    This project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                         opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigators'                        enhanced visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In                    this project, the proposed activities which contribute to the                   second objective include:  teaching two courses, Evolutionary                   Ecology, and a seminar in the History and Role of Women in                      Science; giving lectures on personal research in the                            departmental Entomology and Plant Science seminar series;                       collaborating with a phytochemist and evolutionary ecologist                    in the Entomology department.",
