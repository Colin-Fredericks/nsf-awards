 "awd_abstract_narration": "Study will be made of trace element scavenging mechanisms and                   particle dynamics through measurements of temporal variations                   in dissolved, suspended particulate and sinking particulate                     elemental distributions during a two year time-series study in                  the northeast Pacific.  A recently-developed in situ pump will                  be used for collection of contamination-free size-fractionated                  samples of suspended matter throughout the water column.  Five                  occupations of a deep-water station in the California Current                   will sample three seasons of varying productivity.  This                        sampling will be coupled with simultaneous sediment trap and                    dissolved element measurements to examine the effect of                         changing productivity and vertical mass flux on the overall                     distribution of trace elements in a productive eastern boundary                 water column.  Samples of all three pools will be analyzed for                  Al, Fe, Ca, Si, Mn, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, Ba, I, U, and 232Th.                    This research will address the shortage of fundamental                          information on the distribution of particulate trace elements                   which currently limits formulation of realistic scavenging                      models.  The chemical differences in the behavior of elements                   will be used as probes of the scavenging process, as                            illustrated by our previous measurements of a subset of these                   elements in samples from Bermuda, the Northeast Atlantic, and                   the Northeast Pacific.  In addition, elemental composition of                   particulate matter will be used as a tracer of mass exchange                    among particulate pools.",
