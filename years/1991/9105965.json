 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on transport of toxic                      contaminants in flowing, natural waters involving exchange                      processes between the stream-flow and the stream sediments                      which act as storage locations for the contaminants.  The                       research involves investigation of the fundamentals of                          stream-bed exchange using adsorbing inorganic contaminants                      and utilizing a five-meter long recirculating laboratory                        flume with a fine sand bed.  Adsorbing inorganic tracers                        planned for use include bivalent calcium and trivalent                          aluminum and chromium cations.  The investigators plan on                       using the adsorbable cationic dye tracer methylene blue to                      establish equilibrium and kinetic behavior of organic                           contaminants in batch-scale work before proceeding to                           flume experiments.  This project is being jointly                               supported by the Fluid, Particulate and Hydraulic Systems                       Program and the Environmental Engineering element of the                        Environmental and Ocean Systems Program.                                                                                                                        The relationship of bed-contribution of water pollutants                        from contaminated sediments to water quality with which                         those sediments are placed into contact by physical                             processes influencing the relative motion between                               sediments and particles disturbed by fluid motion are not                       well understood.  It is expected that results of this                           research will contribute toward formulation of better                           models than now exist of interactions between water in                          motion and sediments contaminated with organic and                              inorganic pollutants that contaminate the water, and                            application of those models in environmental and hydraulic                      engineering practice.",
