 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project involves three different areas of                    topology:  knot theory, manifold theory, and homology of groups.                The problems considered are handled by a variety of techniques,                 coming from differential topology (cutting and pasting,                         transversality, transformation groups), homotopy theory (homotopy               groups of spheres, plus construction, S-duality), and algebra                   (homological algebra, combinatorial group theory, symmetric                     forms).                                                                              Part 1 is an investigation of certain classes of higher-                   dimensional knots.  The first class consists of knots which are                 not determined by their complements.  Only recently has it been                 proved that such knots do not occur in 3-space.  On the other                   hand, the investigator has since shown that such knots do occur                 in at least a quarter of all higher dimensions.  He intends to                  find inequivalent knots with the same complement in the missing                 dimensions.  The second class consists of certain knots whose                   complements have cyclic fundamental group.  The classification of               such knots will be pursued by means of algebraic invariants                     associated to their complements.  The third class consists of                   knotted higher-genus surfaces in 4-space.  That this is a much                  richer collection than that of ordinary knotted 2-spheres will be               shown by an analysis of the  peripheral structure of the knot                   groups.                                                                              Part 2 concerns a special class of closed manifolds -- those               obtained by spinning lower-dimensional ones about framed                        submanifolds of spheres.  Using a generalized Pontrjagin-Thom                   construction, the investigator will carry out the homotopy                      classification of such manifolds in certain cases.  Applications                to the bordism classification of homology spheres will be given.                   Part 3 describes an ongoing program with S. Jekel for                        computing the homology of the classifying space for codimension-                one real analytic singular foliations.  The investigator outlines               the calculation of the homology of discrete groups of jets of                   local diffeomorphisms, and of some related nilpotent groups.                    In short, the investigator will apply himself on the one hand, to               some very concrete geometric problems concerning higher                         dimensional knots and symmetries of manifolds, and on the other                 hand, to enlarging the scope of algebraic tools for attacking                   such problems.",
