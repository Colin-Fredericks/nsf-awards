 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to improve the teaching of                      meteorology and climatology at Memphis State University.  This                  will be accomplished by incorporating modern equipment and                      methods of receiving, manipulating and analyzing meteorological                 data and images into the classroom.  The equipment purchased will               allow access, by receiving a satellite transmission, to the data                streams available from the University Center for Atmospheric                    Research (UCAR) Unidata Program Office and the National Weather                 Service (NWS).  A workstation will be purchased that runs PC-                   McIDAS software, which is distributed at no cost by the UCAR                    Unidata Program.  Additionally, a DIFAX facsimile printer capable               of printing weather charts and other data transmitted via                       satellite from the National Meteorological Center of the NWS will               be acquired.                                                                                                                                                         At the introductory level, the PC-McIDAS system will be used               to generate videotapes of sequences of satellite imagery for use                in illustrating principles in lecture.  Copies of weather maps                  made using the DIFAX printer will be used at all levels.  Upper                 level students will get hands-on experience with the systems                    purchased.  These students will use each of these systems to do                 weather analysis, forecasting and as a source of information for                exercises, problem solving and research papers.",
