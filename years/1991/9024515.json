 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project supports an anthropology                     student from Stanford University studying how people in British                 society interpret racial differences, in light of the upcoming                  national census in that country where racial identity will be                   recorded for the first time.  Using an ethnographic methodology,                the student (who is Black) and a research assistant (who will be                White) will study how people living in Liverpool use concepts of                national identity like \"Englishness\" as implicitly racial terms,                as well as explicitly racial terms like \"Asian\" and \"Black\".  In                depth interviews will be conducted with community activists and                 census officials on the political controversy over racial                       categories in the census as well as with a sample of individual                 life histories focusing on their perceptions of race in British                 history.  The investigators will also observe the teaching of                   British history in a senior (high) school.                                                                                                                      This project is significant because it attempts to understand how               a democratic society similar to ours experiences racial change in               their population.  Understanding how race and nationality are                   experienced in a similar but less racially mixed situation will                 help us understand the sources of our own values and behavior.",
