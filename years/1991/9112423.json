 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant will support the acquisition of a Computer                       Numerically Controlled (CNC) surface grinder to support an existing             grant in the area of creep feed grinding of Alumina and Zirconia                ceramics with diamond wheels.  Fundamental grinding parameters have             been obtained to achieve stochastic characterization of unit load               distribution and to provide quantitative analysis of the relative               importance of the material removal mechanism either by fracture or              plastic deformation.                                                                 The CNC grinder will provide state-of-the-art equipment to                 conduct research in the optimization of the ceramic grinding                    process parameters, to achieve cycle times that are competitive                 with metal machining without sacrificing the strength of ground                 structural ceramics.  The ultimate goal is to make ceramic grinding             cost effective and to eliminate the need for secondary operations               such as lapping to finish ground ceramic components.  A study of                wheel wear mechanisms in diamond wheels and the impact of wear on               strength and surface integrity of ground ceramic components will                also be conducted.  This should help in formulating new                         compositions of diamond wheels.",
