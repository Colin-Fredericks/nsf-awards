 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Devlin is supported by a grant from the Experimental                  Physical Chemistry Program to study icy thin films and                          clusters, including crystalline ice, amorphous ice and acid                     hydrates using infrared spectroscopy.  The data acquired will                   enhance our understanding of natural processes such as                          nucleation and growth of icy particles in the atmosphere, the                   molecular-level processes at ice surfaces that lead to charge                   separation in electrical storms, and proton conductivity across                 and along biomembrane-water interfaces.                                                                                                                         The influence of surfaces, interfaces and intense near-infrared                 radiation on point-defect activities (ionic: hydrogen and                       hydroxyl ions, and orientational: L and D) of hydrogen-bonded                   solids will be examined in icy thin films and clusters,                         including ice I, amorphous ice, acid hydrates and clathrate                     hydrates.  Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopies                  will be used to monitor isotopic exchange rates for samples                     containing nonequilibrium quantitites of protium and deuterium                  isotopomers. These experiments will take advantage of a                         technique recently developed by Devlin based on observations                    that the absorption bands of OH groups that dangle from the                     surfaces are distinct from the OH groups which are involved in                  hydrogen bonds. These methods will be applied to the evaluation                 of the hypothesis that phase transitions of icy substances are                  critically dependent on the availability of mobile                              orientational defects.",
