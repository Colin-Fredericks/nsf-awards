 "awd_abstract_narration": "Behavioral ecology addresses questions about how behavior                       mediates processes with important ecological and evolutionary                   consequences.  For instance, we would like to know how foraging                 behavior is adapted to the distribution of resources and how                    these behavioral adjustments influence the relationship between                 the distribution of a resource density and the rate at which it                 is harvested.  The details of this relationship are important for               a variety of behavioral, ecological, and evolutionary problems.                 Earlier attempts to understand this kind of relationship have                   taken a \"black box\" approach to describing mathematically the                   relationship between prey distribution and predation rate.  The                 goal of this project is to open up the black box and analyze the                component parts (processes and mechanisms), focusing on the role                of perception in search and prey detection.                                                                                                                     Ecological foraging theory has paid little attention to how                     perception influences foraging behavior.  Models developed to                   guide naval search operations include perceptual processes and                  constraints that are not explicit in ecological models.  This                   project will examine whether the approach developed in operations               research helps us to understand the role of perception in animal                foraging behavior.  The particular system under study is a native               sparrow species foraging for cryptic weed seeds.  During                        experiments, individuals are video-taped as they search for seeds               scattered on the soil.  From detailed analysis of the location of               individual seeds and of search tactics and success, Dr. Getty can               develop alternative models and test their ability to describe and               predict behavioral tactics and predation rates under various                    conditions.  From these analyses, he can determine the extent to                which perceptual processes alter the relationship between                       resources, behavior, and resource exploitation.",
