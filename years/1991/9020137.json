 "awd_abstract_narration": "The earth's remaining tropical rainforests are threatened                  with  destruction in the next 10 years.  The mechanisms are                     shifting agriculture, conversion to pasture, global climate                     changes, industrial agriculture and logging, and the reasons are                over-population and short-sightedness.  Knowledge which would                   assist in the regeneration and restoration of these forests is                  mostly lacking.  In particular detailed knowledge of the                        environmental factors that determine the growth of the individual               tree species in these forests is needed.  Different trees vary in               their tolerance to shade conditions in the forest, controlling                  the patterns of regeneration of these trees.  Trees growing in                  the natural shade of forests are subjected to a reduction in                    light intensity and a change in the spectral quality of the                     light.  Virtually all of the shade responses of tree  have been                 studied at varying light levels without regard to these shifts in               light quality.  Thus, previous studies on shade responses of                    trees probably underestimate responses of trees to shade                        conditions.                                                                          The purpose of this proposal is to study the effects of                    shifts in light quality independently of the reduced light                      intensity to which plants are exposed in the forest shade.  The                 responses of seedlings of ten Malaysian rainforest trees to                     light quantity and quality will be studied in specially                         constructed shadehouses at the Forestry Research Institute in                   Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  These trees will include pioneer                       species, shade-tolerant emergent and shade-intolerant emergent.                 The seedlings will be grown for twelve months and then be                       analysed for their architecture, leaf morphology and anatomy,                   and photosynthetic properties.  The results will be compared to                 those from seedlings grown under natural canopy shade, and will                 help in understanding how these trees respond to natural light                  climates in the forest.  Such information can also be used to                   help grow them in nurseries for later transplanting into                        regenerating forests.",
