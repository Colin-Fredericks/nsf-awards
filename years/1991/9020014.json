 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to examine the degree to which the                expression of several alternative maternal behaviors exhibited by               Gargaphia solani, is under genetic control.  It is founded upon                 the fact that within the same animal population, behaviors with                 similar functions are often so different that one response can be               considered a distinct alternative to other responses.  The                      factors determining whether behavioral alternatives stem from                   genetic or environmental differences among individuals are                      understood in only a few cases.  Gargaphia  provides a model                    system with which to examine behavioral alternatives because of                 the unusual maternal behaviors exhibited by these organisms:                    within a single populaton females either guard their offspring                  from predators, abandon their eggs after laying, or leave their                 eggs to the care and protection of another female.  Furthermore,                egg recipients either aggressively repel egg donors or passively                accept their eggs.  The existence of these and other maternal                   options in G. solani provides an opportunity to characterize the                extent to which the expression of each alternative is regulated                 by genes, by environmental conditions, or by some interaction                   between the two.  This project will examine the genetic component               of behavioral alternatives associated with egg dumping and                      antipredator aggression by means of half-sib analyses, intra-and                interpopulation comparisons, and artificial selection.                          Integration of this information will provide a valuable expansion               of the experimental base upon which theories concerning the                     evolution, mechanisms, and ecology of alternative behavioral                    tactics can be tested.",
