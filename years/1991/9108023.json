However, only recently their                                    applications to civil engineering structures                                    such as buildings and bridges for their                                         safety and confort design in seismic or wind                                    conditions have been seriously pursued.  The                                    potential and future research needs for such                                    applications were the focal points of                                           discussion during a recent National Workshop                                    on Structural Control Research,  held at the                                    University of Southern California (USC) in                                      October, 1990.                                                                                                                                                  One essential component of the structural                                       control technology is that related to new                                       sensors, actuators, and signal processing                                       which was not covered during the USC                                            Workshop.  These aspects hold the key to the                                    successful implementation of structural                                         control from both technological and practical                                   considerations that represent a rapidly                                         evolving field of cross-disciplinary nature.                                    This Workshop will bring together a number of                                   key academic and industry researchers active                                    in structural control and behavior, sensors                                     and actuator technology, and signal                                             processing to identify those research                                           directions which offer the greatest potential                                   impact on structural performance.                                                                                                                               This effort will provide a critical component                                   of the technical basis required for the                                         development and implementation of control                                       technology in providing the design safety of                                    new structures.  It will also provide                                           valuable insights on the potential use of                                       control technology in the upgrading and                                         rehabilitation of vulnerable existing                                           structures which are exposed to the threat of                                   natural hazards.",
