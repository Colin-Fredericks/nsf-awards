 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to extensive evaluations, elementary and middle school                students are failing to learn basic geometric concepts and geometric            problem solving, and are woefully underprepared for the study of more           sophisticated geometric concepts and proof.  The most critical barrier          to students' successful learning of geometry is the failure of standard         geometry curricula to systematically facilitate students' progression           from basic intuitions and simple concepts to higher levels of geometric         thought.  To overcome this barrier, mathematics educators need to know          specific conceptual constructions they make, and how such progression           can be facilitated in the classroom.  It has become apparent in our             current NSF-supported curriculum development project that the original          levels of geometric thought described by Piaget and van Hiele are useful        but not completely adequate for understanding children's geometric              thinking or designing and fine-tuning instructional treatments.  Thus,          the major goal of the proposed project is to construct more elaborate,          precise, and powerful descriptions and models of children's development         of geometric thinking.  Such descriptions and models have strong                potential to impact on theories of learning geometry.  In fact, a by-           product of the proposed research project will be further refinement and         field-testing of the Logo-based geometry curriculum that we are                 currently developing ( which we consider to be one implementation of the        NCTM Standards for teaching geometry.)",
