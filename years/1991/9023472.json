 "awd_abstract_narration": "Skilled reading requires the acquisition of several subskills,                  ranging from recognition of individual words to combination of                  words and sentences into the overall meaning of a text.  This                   research will investigate the processes by which a skilled reader               can determine the sound of a word.  One possible process is that                readers first identify the word's letters and then use their                    knowledge of spelling-to-sound rules to determine its                           pronunciation.  However, there is another way to determine a                    word's pronunciation.  Instead of using spelling-to-sound rules,                a reader can simply use the letters to look up the word in his                  mental dictionary.  When a word is located in the mental                        dictionary, information about its meaning and pronunciation can                 be retrieved.                                                                                                                                                   Spelling-to-sound rules can enable a reader to pronounce unknown                words.  Thus, most readers would pronounce BIM to rhyme with                    \"him\".  Beginning readers would find this very useful since there               are many words they have not learned to read, but that are part                 of their aural vocabulary.  On the other hand, fast and fluent                  reading may require that readers be able to go directly from the                identification of the letters to their mental dictionary.  Also,                only the dictionary route can lead to the correct pronunciation                 and identification of some words.  For example, if the rules are                followed, then the letters PINT would be pronounced to rhyme with               \"hint\", \"mint\", and \"lint\".                                                                                                                                     Despite the fact that two routes from print to sound would appear               to be useful, the existence of two functionally independent and                 anatomically separate routes remains controversial.  Single-route               models consistent with existing experimental data have been                     proposed in recent years.  One view is that skilled readers                     always rely on the rules to translate print to sound, whereas                   another view is that skilled readers only use the dictionary                    route.  This research, which will involve both experimentation                  and computer simulation, is aimed at testing the dual-route                     hypothesis that both processes are used by skilled readers of                   English.                                                                                                                                                        The results of this project could provide insights into better                  methods for teaching beginning reading, for teaching English as a               second language, and for understanding some forms of dyslexia.",
