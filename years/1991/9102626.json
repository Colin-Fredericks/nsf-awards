 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Bernard Gordon,                      Department of  Polymer Science, Pennsylvania State University,                  to pursue with Dr. Seng Neon Gan, Department of Chemistry,                      University of Malaya, macromer synthesis via delocalized                        carbanions.  Their research  will involve (1) preparing new                     macromers (polymers with a reactive terminal) by anionic                        initiation, (2) chemically modifying hydrogenated rubbers to                    produce elastic fragments with reactive terminals, and (3)                      investigating the reactions of epoxidized natural rubber with                   various macromers and polymers prepared by anionic initiation.                                                                                                  Diversification of the traditional uses of natural and                          synthetic rubbers  can be achieved by changing the properties                   of the base polymers.  This can be done by direct chemical                      reactions to change the structures or by grafting other                         polymers onto the rubber structure.  This project adds an                       international cooperative dimension to the PI's research                        under NSF Grant  No. DMR-8822938.  Dr. Gan's experience with                    natural and synthetic  rubbers and prior collaboration with                     the PI on macromers will add a valuable new dimension to the                    ongoing research.  This project is relevant to the objectives                   of the Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks to                   increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and developing                   country scientists and engineers through the exchange of                        scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and                       through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
