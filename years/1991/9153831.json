 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 2.5 year project will provide enhancement                                  opportunities in mathematics education for all teachers of                      grades K through two in Columbiana County, Ohio, an                             economically depressed, rural Appalachian area. The                             purposes are four-fold: to enhance teachers' knowledge of                       mathematics and developmentally appropriate pedagogical                         practices; to increase the use of manipulative materials in                     mathematics instruction; to foster awareness of cultural                        and gender equity issues pertinent to a rural setting; and                      to develop a cadre of teacher leaders who can help sustain                      the ideas of the project following funding. School                              principals will be involved in central ways. The project                        builds on an earlier effort supported with Eisenhower                           funds; 32 teachers from that early effort will serve as                         peer coaches and mentors in the current project. During the                     91*-92 academic year and summer, and then in the 92-93                          academic year and summer, all 174 primary teachers in the                       county will participate  in school-based inservice                              activities and summer institutes. The peer coaches will                         receive additional preparation and will work with the                           participants in their schools throughout the project. A                         strong qualitative evaluation process will support                              dissemination of the project's successes and strategies.                                                                                                        Cost sharing is provided by Kent State University and                           Columbiana County as 28% of the NSF award.",
