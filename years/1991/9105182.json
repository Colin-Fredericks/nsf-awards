 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are:  (1) modeling and                     observational studies of intense downdrafts.  This will involve                 extensions to the one-dimensional models already in existence,                  completion and extension of work on the modeling of axially                     symmetric downdrafts including detailed microphysics.  An                       extension to three dimensions and inclusion of more complete                    microphysics (drop coalescence and breakup in addition to melting               and evaporation) in all the models is anticipated.  The results                 of the various models will be compared with radar and, in                       particular, surface meteorological data; (2) A comparison of ZDR                measured by a radar, with that calculated from the drop size                    distribution inferred from profiler observations, and studies of                the size spectra of raindrops and raindrop oscillations by means                of profiler observations; (3) Numerical simulations and                         theoretical studies of a dual-radar method of measurement of                    rainwater content and rainfall rate and tests of the method                     against observations; and (4) A theoretical calculation of the                  growth of drops by condensation in very slow updrafts, as in                    stratiform clouds.",
