 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Center Foundation (NSCF) is a nonprofit               organization whose goal is to improve performance of U.S. students              in mathematics and science by creating new technological tools for              teaching those subjects and implementing them in our schools.                        The NSCF's initial objective is to develop a computer-based                teaching system, including courseware, to improve the teaching and              learning of secondary school mathematics from algebra I through                 calculus.                                                                            Design of a unique teaching system called Learning Logic (L2)              began in October 1988, functional specifications were finalized in              June 1989, and basic L2 system operating software and 15 algebra I              courseware topics were completed and alpha tested in June 1990.                 Development to that juncture was funded by the private sector and               a state of Georgia grant.                                                            National Science Foundation funding over three years will be               used to complete and test operating system software and courseware              for algebra I, algebra II, trigonometry, and calculus, to complete              courseware design for geometry, to produce a courseware authoring               system, and to deploy L2 nationally.  A timeline includes the beta              test of fully enhanced operating software and algebra I alpha test              by seven Georgia high schools during 1990-91; the algebra I and II              courseware beta test in 100 schools in 1991-1992; completion of an              authoring system, completion through testing of all mathematics                 courseware except geometry, and enlisting 500 schools in 1992-93.                    The overall goal of the project is to orient school personnel              and students to a prototype program for urban school improvement                with emphasis on developing competence in science and mathematics.//",
