 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the development of the laser the problem of the                            interaction of a polarized beam of monochromatic radiation                      with a scattering material has gained considerable importance                   in the heat transfer community.  Lasers are now used as                         diagnostic tools to probe hot combustion gases as well as the                   atmosphere, and to measure the radiative properties of packed-                  beds, thermal insulations, ceramics, and human tissue.  Laser-                  based micromachining systems abound in the microelectronics                     industry and hold great potential in the fabrication of                         micromechanical structures.  The medical applications of                        lasers range from treating heart disease and cancer to                          dentistry and eye surgery.  The use of laser beams as                           \"tweezers\" to seize and manipulate bits of living cells is                      being considered as a way to improve gene-mapping methods.                      Most of these applications must be classified as                                multidimensional because of the finite size of the laser beam                   which is linearly polarized, and they often involve multiple                    and anisotropic scattering.  A definite need exists to develop                  a theoretical model for radiative transfer that can                             incorporate all these factors and to develop guidelines and                     approximate procedures for handling polarization effects.                                                                                                       This project is a theoretical and experimental study of three-                  dimensional radiative heat transfer including polarization and                  multiple scattering.  Specifically, the effects of multiple                     scattering on a laser beam of known polarization (linear,                       circular, or elliptical) are under investigation.  The laser                    beam is incident perpendicular to the top, flat surface of a                    cylindrical scattering medium.  The scattering centers are                      homogeneous spherical particles which are randomly distributed                  within the medium.  A theoretical model is being developed                      based on the three-dimensional vector transport equation for                    the Stokes parameters.  The usual scattering phase function                     will be replaced by a 4x4 phase matrix.  The transport                          equation will be reduced to a one-dimensional form using the                    double Fourier transform method, and the resulting equation                     will be solved by Ambartsumian's method.  The back-scattered                    radiation will then be calculated using a double inverse                        Fourier transform.  The theoretical analysis will be first                      carried out for small spherical particles, i.e., Rayleigh                       scattering.  A series of carefully controlled experiments will                  be conducted with latex microspheres suspended in pure water                    to validate the theoretical model.  The concentration of the                    microspheres will be varied so that the optical thickness of                    the scattering medium will range from thin to thick.  The                       results of this research will provide insight into a number of                  practical problems involving the interaction of a polarized                     laser beam with a scattering medium.  The development of a                      more realistic radiation model should have a significant                        impact in many fields where lasers are utilized including heat                  transfer, manufacturing, and medicine.",
