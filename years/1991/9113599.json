 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in the Role of Cognition in Collective Political                 Decision Making.  The faculty group is a mixture of Political                   Scientists and Psychologists at Ohio State University and at a                  number of other institutions throughout the country who will form               an \"Invisible College\" for the purpose of this training effort.                 The centerpiece of the RTG will be an annual workshop to be held                each summer for 6 weeks at Ohio State University.  The workshop                 will explore the role of cognition and politics in the definition               and development of solutions to societal problems.  The funds                   will provide stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral                    trainees, will defray part of the cost of the trainees' research,               and to defray the costs of participation in the summer workshops                by investigators from other research and academic institutions.                 Institutional commitments will pay student tuition at Ohio State,               allow the faculty to devote time to organization of the summer                  workshop, will defray a portion of the cost of the workshop and                 will insure continuation of some trainee positions after the                    termination of NSF support.                                                                                                                                     Although many political decisions are made by groups,                           psychologists trying to understand the decision-making process                  have traditionally focussed on the definition of problems and                   solutions by individuals, while political scientists have                       focussed on the role of power and control rather than that of                   cognition.  This  training group will explore this relatively                   neglected interface between these two approaches.  Examples of                  relevant research being pursued by the Ohio State faculty include               investigation of the role of creativity in foreign policy                       decision making, of adjustments of outcome expectation in                       decision making, and of how individual agendas become group                     agendas in the decision making by community health boards.                      Additional research topics and expertise will come from the                     outside membership of the summer workshop faculty.",
