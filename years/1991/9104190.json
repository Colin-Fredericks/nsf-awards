 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent experiments by the applicants have shown that the glycogen-              deficient phenotype of the glc7- (ppy1-1) mutant of S. cerevisiae               is a result of a mutation in the gene for the catalytic subunit of              protein phosphatase 1.  This gene, which has been cloned an named               PPY1, shares 81% sequence identity at the amino acid level with                 phosphatase 1 from rabbit skeletal muscle.  The first major                     objective of the proposed studies is to determine the DNA sequence              of the mutant PPY1 gene and to compare wild type and mutant protein             phosphatase 1 with respect to substrate specificity, turnover                   number and association with regulatory proteins.  The association               with regulatory proteins is of particular interest since                        preliminary experiments indicate that chromatographic properties                of the enzyme are affected by the mutation, a finding which is most             readily explained by altered association with regulatory subunits.              In rabbit skeletal muscle, protein phosphatase 1 exists only in                 association with one of the three regulatory subunits, which are                know as inhibitor 2, G-subunit and M-subunit.  The second major                 objective of the proposed studies is to characterize regulatory                 subunits or heat-stable inhibitor proteins that interact with the               phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit and to determine if they are                    homologous to the regulatory proteins that have been identified in              mammals.  Association with regulatory subunits will be evaluated                by identification of holoenzyme forms by chromatographic and                    immunological methods.  The results of these experiments will help              to elucidate the regulation of an important class of enzymes.//",
