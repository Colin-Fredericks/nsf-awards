The                           program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,                      and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise                    and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                             This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research                    visit by Christopher John Doona of Brandeis University with                     Dr. Friedeman W. Schneider of the Institut fur Physikalische                    Chemie der Universitat Wurzburg, Germany.  The researchers                      will examine the luminol oscillator for the effects of                          imperfect mixing with Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy                   (CARS).  The crossed laser system used in CARS enables small,                   discrete regions within a reactor to be examined independently.                 A complete mapping of the mixing profile in the reactor thus                    can be determined.  Mapping mixing with CARS in a nonreactive                   system is done only at Wurzburg.  This proposal will extend                     this technique to the reactive luminol system, and will be                      helpful in understanding mixing effects in other systems and                    in the modelling of exotic dynamic behavior such as chaos.                                                                                                      The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the                      U.S. home institution.",
