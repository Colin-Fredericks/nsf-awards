 "awd_abstract_narration": "When programming massively parallel computations, programmers must              specify large numbers of processes and their interactions, efficiently          map their logical structures onto disparate hardware structures, and            debug in the absence of reproducibility and consistent global states.           Some of these activities can be supported by extensions of sequential           tools, but most require development of novel techniques specific to             parallelism.  This development is made even more challenging by the             diversity of target architectures, the relative lack of experience              with parallelism, and the range in degree and granularity of available          parallelism.  This research focuses on support for message-passing              architectures.  During the funding period, work will continue on                parallel program specification and debugging, and begin on programming          support specific to the Connection Machine.                                                                                                                     The abstractions provided by a programming environment determine a              programmer's effectiveness in implementing and debugging algorithms,            yet few abstractions support massive parallelism.  A graph grammar-             based editor can facilitate the concise, scalable specification of              parallel programs as annotated graph families.  Specification,                  however, is not enough.  Program graphs must be available to other              tools - such as debuggers, animators, and mappers - within the                  environment.  This work will investigate the applicability of existing          techniques, to design methods of partial visualization, and determine           the feasibility and utility of lazy graph generation.  It is intended           to explore the adaptation of these graphical specification techniques           for the Connection Machine.",
