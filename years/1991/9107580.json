 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1974 Dr. Kuniholm has worked to devise a                                  dendrochronological sequence for Southern Europe and the Near                   East.  To date, he has constructed a tree ring series which                     extends over approximately 3,000 years and which covers major                   portions of Turkey, Greece, Italy and adjacent areas in                         Southeastern Europe.  With partial support from the National                    Science Foundation, he will continue this work.  Over the course                of three field seasons, together with his colleagues, he will                   visit numerous sites in the region to collect old wood. Analysis                at Kuniholm's Cornell laboratory will then permit their                         incorporation into a master chronology.  The goals of this three                year effort are: 1. to fill in the gaps which remain in the                     chronology and 2. to extend it's geographic range.                                                                                                              Because the width of a tree ring is determined by environmental                 factors such as temperature and precipitation, rings within a                   single tree vary from year to year.  By working from living                     specimens back through beams in buildings to ancient buried wood                it is possible to construct a chronology where an absolute dates                can be assigned.  With such a master chronology it is then                      possible to take wood of unknown age and then determine where, if               at all, it fits within the sequence.  This fact is of great                     archaeological importance because tree ring analysis provides the               most precise dating technique known.  It is possible, for                       example, to use burned charcoal from hearths for this goal. The                 more precisely and more confidently archaeologists can place an                 event in time, the wider the range of potential questions which                 can be answered.  Tree ring dating was first practiced in the                   U.S. Southwest and it revolutionized archaeology there.  Dr.                    Kuniholm has worked patiently to develop a chronology in another                archaeologically important part of the world and his results to                 date have been impressive.                                                                                                                                      This research is important not only to archaeologists, but also                 to paleoecologists, climatologists and others who use data                      derived from the past.  The tree ring chronology will not only                  provide a basis to increase our understanding of past human                     behavior, but also help to illumine such issues as the effect of                human actions on climate.",
