 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted on the mechanical properties of grain                boundaries and bicrystals from both atomistic and continuum points              of view.  The validity of a continuum description of the                        heterogeneous nature of grain boundaries at the atomic scale has                been established through comparisons with detailed atomistic                    simulations.  This has led to the classification of locally stable,             metastable and unstable grain boundary structures and                           identification of the physically more reasonable structure among                the multiple ones found for a given bicrystal.  The research builds             on these findings and continues to emphasize the relation between               atomistic and continuum theories.  A detailed study of the internal             stresses in interface regions and at free surfaces, which can                   generally be of significant magnitude, will be undertaken.  The                 implication of the loss of positive definitieness or strong                     ellipticity for the fourth-order tensor of elastic moduli and the               corresponding possibiity, respectively, of locally negative strain              energies or bifurcations and discontinuities will be studied.                   Better bounds or estimates for the effective properties of the                  atomically heterogeneous continuum model will be developed.  The                theory wil be applied to grain boundaries and interfaces between                two different metals, free surfaces, interfaces between thin films              and substrates, and the influence of alloying, manifested in                    segregation and/or ordering, on elastic properties.                             %%%                                                                             Studies of the mechanical properties of materials usually use a                 continuum approach even though materials are known to be made up of             discrete elements such as atoms and molecules.  The mechanical                  properties are dependent on the structure of grain boundaries                   bewteen crystal grains and on the existence of bicrystals.  It is               possible to study the structure of grain boundaries from an                     atomistic approach.  However, there is very little work which                   connects the atomistic study of grain boundaries with the continuum             approach.  This grant proposes to do just this.  A consistent                   approach will be taken to study grain boundaries from an atomistic              point of view and then connect this with the continuum description.",
