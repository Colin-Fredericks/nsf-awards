 "awd_abstract_narration": "An enigmatic limestone breccia in the Guilmette Formation of               southeastern Nevada will be investigated.  The Guilmette Formation              spans the Late Devonian Frasnian-Famennian stage boundary.  The                 breccia is exposed in seven ranges over at least 5000 square miles              and has known thicknesses ranging from 25 to 435 feet; it                       encompasses a volume of 100 cubic miles or more.                                     The breccia appears to be a single sedimentary carbonate bed               not tectonically, diagenetically, or solution-derived.  It has a                sharp, scoured base, and contains haphazardly oriented,                         lithologically heterogeneous clasts that fine-upward.  Some clasts              reach 50 feet or more in longest dimension.  The breccia occurs in              a shallow-water marine setting, based on characteristics of                     overlying and underlying beds.  It suggests catastrophic origin,                perhaps related to an extraterrestrial object impacting Earth.                       The breccia and its significance will be investigated through:             stratigraphic analysis of overlying and underlying beds to refine               its paleogeographic setting; characterization of its internal                   properties to determine provenance, transporting and depositing                 mechanisms, and to test the single-event hypothesis; narrowing its              age designation through closer biostratigraphic zonation; searching             for links to possible extraterrestrial genesis, e.g., shocked                   quartz, geochemical anomalies, etc.",
