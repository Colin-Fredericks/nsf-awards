 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to pressures associated with sharply fluctuating                    customer demand, accelerating technological innovation,                         acquisitions or joint venture arrangements, and the emergence of                global markets, many large organizations are replacing hierarchical             and matrix forms of management with a `dynamic network' design.                 Dynamic networks are a combination of functional-organization and               flexible structures such that the major components of the                       organization can be assembled and reassembled in order to meet                  complex and changing competitive conditions.  The University of                 Minnesota and Texaco Inc. propose to undertake a joint study of the             role of group decision support systems(GDSS's) and related                      information technologies in facilitating a corporation's transition             to a dynamic network form.  The project will involve:(a) design and             implementation of GDSS prototypes for use in decision rooms and in              local and wide-area networks; (b) studies of GDSS use within and                between work teams; and (c) studies of GDSS impacts on individuals,             teams, and larger business units.  GDSS will be studied as one                  aspect of a larger set of change approaches, including quality                  programs, self-managed teams, and advanced information technologies             (specifically, electronic mail and group conferencing systems).                 Several propositions related to GDSS design, use and impacts will               be explored.  This project builds on a base of GDSS design, theory              development, and laboratory research conducted at Minnesota and                 field work conducted in a GDSS facility at Texaco.",
