 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will complete a major longitudinal study of the                   role of patterns of emotion expression and emotion-related                      behaviors in the development of temperament/personality and                     competencies in childhood.  The stability and predictive efficacy               of indexes of infants' emotion-related responses, including                     patterns of cardiac activity, will be evaluated across the first                5-1/2 years of life.  The project will have five aspects relating               to emotional development from birth to 5 years of age. It will                  study (1) stability and change in expressive behavior, (2) the                  construct validity of emotion variables, (3) developmental                      changes in emotion responses to pleasant and mildly stressful                   conditions. (4) development al changes in relations among emotion               expression variables and patterns of cardiac activity under                     pleasant and mildly stressful conditions, and (5) early emotion                 variables as predictors of later socioemotional and affective-                  cognitive competence.  Results from the first two years of the                  research showed that early-infancy emotion variables were                       significant predictors of the quality of infant-mother attachment               at 13 months (an important index of socioemotional competence)                  and of infant temperament at 13, 18, and 24 months.  Early                      emotion variable s predicted significant aspects of the                         development of personality and social behavior.  This research                  will further our understanding emotional development.",
