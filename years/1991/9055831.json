 "awd_abstract_narration": "About twenty investigative lessons are being developed for display              on a Videoshow unit from General Parametrics Corporation, which                 will help build a model curriculum for lower division, introductory             biology courses.  Emphasis for the lecture packages will be placed              on visually clear examples of experimental sequences, flow charts,              and data that add dimension to a student's understanding of                     scientific processes.  Analytical skills will be enhanced by                    numerous examples of experimental data presented first in raw form              then displayed in a graphic or statistical manner that changes                  numbers into information.  The strong visual support for these                  difficult concepts will help an under represented general student               population understand scientific methodology.  Unique features of               Videoshow that contribute to the overall quality of the lecture                 products are its programmability, adaptability, ease of use, random             access features, and quality of images.  The addition of slide,                 print, and transparency makers to the system will increase                      versatility. Changes in student achievement will be evaluated and               compared before and after implementation of the new program with                results being reported both locally and nationally.",
