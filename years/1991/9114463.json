 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE Communications Theory Workshop has been held each year for             about 20 years.  It has been held on the east coast and the west                coast of the United States alternately.  It is held in relatively               small hotels at somewhat isolated locations in order to focus and               enhance group interaction.  Attendees are primarily senior workers              in the communications theory area.  No written proceedings are                  generated.  It is a true workshop atmosphere,  with invited                     sessions only, no parallel sessions, approximately 100 attendees,               and maximum attendee interaction and discussion.                                                                                                                This year for the first time and on a trial basis the workshop will             be held outside the US., in Rhodes, Greece.  It is hoped that this              will generate a greater level of international input and exchange.                                                                                              The purpose of the workshop is to present new results in all areas              of communications theory.  Focus areas are chosen each year, and                outstanding workers in these areas are invited to give lead off                 presentations to stimulate the discussion.  Focus areas for this                year are modulation and coding, optical communication systems,                  networking, and broadband telecommunications.                                                                                                                   The NSF award is to be used primarily to provide support for                    younger faculty members in the US who would otherwise be unable to              attend.  In order to insure some minimum Soviet participation a                 small part of the on site expenses of a senior Soviet worker may be             offset by the conference and the award if necessary.//",
