 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to provide non-scientists with a                  deeper understanding and richer insight of biology, as well as                  provide the skills necessary to better assess and apply science                 in their lives.  Knowledgeability, skills, and enjoyment of                     students enrolled in the course are promoted by placing                         biological principles within a more relevant context that                       complements the needs, experiences, and learning styles of the                  non-science majors.  Novel laboratory experiments and in-class                  discussions are utilized to develop problem solving, higher                     order thinking, communication, and collaborative skills.  To                    facilitate this process, innovative approaches utilizing active                 and cooperative learning, and new delivery systems (videodisc,                  videomicroscopy, and computers) are incorporated as part of the                 instructional strategy.  The changes in course context,                         approach, and delivery are accompanied by ongoing assessment                    and training of teachers.",
