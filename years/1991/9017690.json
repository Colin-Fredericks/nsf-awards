 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Quaternary Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) of the Chilean Andes                has been investigated by teams of US scientists concerned with                  quantifying the mantle source components in arc parent magmas, and              the degree to which these magmas have interacted with arc crust.                Longitudinal variations in crustal age, thickness, and the age of               the subducted plate make this an ideal target for regional studies.                                                                                             The primary focus of this project is an exceptionally detailed and              comprehensive investigation of Tatara-San Pedro (TSP) (36o S), the              youngest edifice (ca. 150ka to Holocene) of the San Pedro-Pellado               volcanic complex.  This study will be grounded on a wealth of                   regional information concerning along-strike and across strike                  variations in Quaternary activity.                                                                                                                              In addition to its compositional variability, TSP is exceptionally              well exposed from its base: 1 km vertical (or composite) sections               (up to 150 flows) are exposed in deep glacial canyons from all                  quadrants of the cone.  These sections will be sampled on a 100%                flow-by-flow basis (chemistry and paleomagnetism) in conjunction                with sampling of abundant crustal xenoliths, lateral sampling of                select Pleistocene lavas, and detailed surface sampling of two                  spectacularly heterogeneous Holocene flows.  A detailed                         reconstruction of the eruptive history of TSP will be made by                   correlating among these sections through integration of                         paleosecular magnetic variation data, physical stratigraphy,                    geochemistry and petrography, and high-resolution geochronology.",
