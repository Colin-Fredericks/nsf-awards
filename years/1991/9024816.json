 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for three years to continue a survey of                parasites of mammals of Bolivia begun in 1984.  Collections will                concentrate on parasitic nematodes but will include other                       helminths, ectoparasites, and protozoa.  Specimens representative               of various taxa will be collected and preserved using standard                  methods.  Collections will include formalin-preserved alcohol-                  stored specimens for standard morpho-taxonomy and identification                and frozen specimens for molecular analyses.  The primary                       objectives of the proposed research include: 1) Secure data                     (specimens) for both morphologic (taxonomy) and molecular analysis              (systematics) that would otherwise be lost or not be preserved                  adequately for these analyses; 2) Obtain additional materials and               data for comparison and inclusion in ongoing studies of host-                   parasite coevolution; 3) Continue collaboration with workers and                students in Bolivia on studies of the parasite fauna of Bolivia                 and to encourage Bolivian students to study in the USA; 4) Provide              access to researchers interested in parasites of neotropical                    mammals by processing and accessing into the UCD Nematode                       Collection those samples of Helminths collected in Bolivia since                1984; 5) Enter these data into the micro-computer database of the               UCD Nematode Collection in a form compatible with the GIS system                presently being implemented at the American Museum to allow fast                and easy access to information on parasites and their hosts.                         The diversity of the mammalian fauna of Bolivia is poorly                  known; thus, the parasites of this region are even less will known              (eg. less than 30 references exist concerning parasites of wild                 animals of Bolivia).  Funds are requested at this time for work on              the parasites of mammals in Bolivia partly because of the window                of opportunity afforded by the presently funded NSF grant to                    Anderson, Yates, and Cook (BSR-8408923) for continuation of their               survey of the mammalian fauna of Bolivia in the Valles and Yungas               regions.  These researchers have established a protocol of time-                frames and collection areas.  The areas in which the expedition                 will travel are biologically unknown, and funding of this proposal              will allow unique and irreplaceable data on diversity of parasites              of these mammals to be accumulated, processed, stored, and accessed             in an efficient manner.  In addition, inclusion of material                     obtained from geographic areas that were not visited in 1984-1987               will allow further tests of hypotheses of coevolution and                       zoogeography.",
