 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                   anthropologist studying the effects of growing up together on                   marital preferences.  The project tests the \"Westermarck                        hypothesis\", that intimate interaction in early childhood                       (\"cosocialization\") leads to sexual indifference in adulthood.                  The study will take place in Morocco, where the custom of                       marriage with the father's brother's son can provide evidence                   to test the hypothesis.  Psychological distances with regard to                 marital attraction will be estimated between interviewees, who                  will be adolescent males and  females, and stimulus subjects, who               will be a list of potential marriage partners.  Cosocialized                    persons will be compared with non-cosocialized persons, holding                 constant the influences of  other variables such as wealth,                     physical attractiveness and present social proximity.                                                                                                           This research is important because understanding the nature of                  sexual attraction and childhood cosocialization helps to explain                the function of the social life of families as well as shed light               on inbreeding avoidance responses.",
