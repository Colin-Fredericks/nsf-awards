 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the research is to investigate two hypotheses               involving sedimentation associated with the emplacement of shallow              marine ash-flow tuffs.  Specifically, these hypotheses are:  1)                 that Ordovician ash-flow tuffs of the Capel Curig Volcanic                      Formation were emplaced and welded underwater, and 2) that                      explosive volcanism has a significant impact on influencing                     patterns of shallow marine sedimentation.  Ordovician volcanic and              volcaniclastic rocks of the Capel Curig Volcanic Formation provide              an ideal laboratory for testing these hypotheses.                                    Sedimentary rocks associated with ash-flow tuffs in the                    Ordovician of North Wales are well exposed and contain numerous                 sedimentary structures.  Detailed mapping by the British Geological             Survey has provided a well-defined stratigraphic context for this               work.  Furthermore, many of these ash-flow tuffs have been                      interpreted to have been emplaced and welded underwater, although               this hypothesis has been controversial.  Yet the tuffs of the Capel             Curig Volcanic Formation have remained one of the textbook examples             of welding in shallow marine water.  The study will determine                   environments of deposition in the associated sedimentary rocks                  beneath the tuffs and paleowater depths from numerous bedding plane             exposures of wave ripples.  Determination of the environments of                deposition will test the likelihood of subaqueous welding.                      Comparing pre-tuff environments with ones that existed following                tuff emplacement will determine the effect that these tuffs had on              patterns of sedimentation.                                                           Successful completion of this work will provide data far                   beyond that of solving a local geological problem in Wales.  This               project will bear directly on the question of subaqueous welding                and on the specific examples that have been most often to support               welding in intermediate depth water.  Also, models of                           volcaniclastic sedimentation from the Capel Curig Volcanic                      Formation will be developed that can be applied in many future                  studies and used to determine the influence that explosive                      volcanism plays on patterns of marine shelf sedimentation.",
