 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to address a central but poorly               understood topic in the evolution of life-history patterns in                   organisms:  whether trade-offs of one ability relative to another               result from trade-offs of nutritional resources at the                          physiological level.  Specifically, the trade-off between flight                capability and reproductive output of the crickets Gryllus                      rubens, will be considered.  Individuals of this species occur as               one of two genetically determined forms.  One form exhibits                     elevated egg production but cannot fly while the other is less                  fecund but is capable of flight.  The nutritional intake of the                 two forms and the internal partitioning of nutrients among                      flight, reproductive and other non-flight and non-reproductive                  tissues in these crickets will be measured.  This study will                    break new ground in its effort to investigate whether there is a                trade-off of resources between the anatomical structures and                    physiological processes underlying a genetically determined                     trade-off seen at the level of whole organism life-history.  In                 addition, by obtaining data on the physiological bases of                       dispersal and reproduction, this study will provide important                   background information for applied studies that attempt to                      control insect populations.",
