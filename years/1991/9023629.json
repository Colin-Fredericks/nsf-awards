 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Faculty Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers                  recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching                 and scholarship, as well as potential research, the academic                    profession, and the education of future scientists and engineers.               Dr. Faber's research under this award is directed at                            understanding the mechanical behavior of brittle materials.                          A ubiquitous feature of multiphase ceramics and ceramic-                   metal systems is residual stress.  Such stresses are present due                to thermal expansion mismatch strains that cannot be accommodated               by deformation during processing.  Such stresses in the extreme                 may serve as a source of failure, or alternatively, may enhance                 the fracture resistance of the material depending on the sign,                  the locale, and the magnitude of the stress.  Given the pivotal                 role of residual stresses, it is essential to know both the                     magnitude and the profile of these stresses to aid in our                       understanding of fracture and toughening in multiphase materials.                    It is the aim of this study to characterize residual                       stresses in two ceramic-based systems, in particular, systems                   where residual stresses are altered through the application of an               external stress or a thermal treatment.  Two systems are                        proposed:  (1) a silicon carbide - titanium diboride composite in               which stress-induced microcracking and stress-relief on                         microcracking has recently been observed; and (2) zirconia                      thermal barrier coatings on metallic substrates in which the                    residual stresses change after high temperature exposure.  X-ray                diffraction and, when necessary, neutron diffraction will be the                primary tools used to measure residual stresses.  The residual                  stress profile and its change after stressing or heat treatment                 will be correlated to measured mechanical properties.",
