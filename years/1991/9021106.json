 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insects which specialize in feeding on only certain groups                 of plants are important experimental organisms for addressing two               fundamental questions in evolutionary biology.  These are 1) what               factors influence the appearance of new varieties or races of                   organisms?  and 2) what factors determine the rate and direction                of evolution?  New varieties of insects have been found when new                plants are introduced to or invade areas where an insect is                     already feeding on a related plant.  Dr. Dingle proposes to study               an insect species that feeds on various species of related plants               and has switched in parts of its range to plant species that have               been introduced as ornamentals.  Dr. Dingle will study the                      evolution of the differentiation by examining the influence of                  genes and the environment on this evolution.  Dr. Dingle will                   also examine the basis of host choice in the two populations and                test to see if the two populations will still interbreed.  In                   this way Dr. Dingle will attempt to learn if the two populations                have differentiated enough to be separate species.                                   The problem of adaptation to new host plants is of                         considerable basic and practical importance.  Most important crop               plants are introduced and it is important to know how readily                   insects can adapt to them and become pests.  Many alien plants                  are accidentally introduced and may thus \"escape\" the insects                   which normally feed on them to become abundant weeds.  To control               them it is useful to know how readily new insects can adapt to                  them and replace the natural enemies they left behind.  The                     insect studied here is particularly useful because the effect of                a switch in host plants, a dramatic change in mouth part                        structure, is so easy to measure and manipulate.  As a result of                this switch, the insect has evolved changes in the structure of                 mouth parts used in feeding on the different plants.  The                       research thus holds great potential for minimizing insect damage                to introduced crops and to maximize damage to introduced weeds.",
