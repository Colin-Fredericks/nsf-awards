 "awd_abstract_narration": "The potential of computers is limited by how effectively users                  can access their computing power via the user interface.  This                  research attacks the problem of usability by fundamental                        improvements to the interface development process.  It aims at a                new generation of behaviorally-oriented techniques for                          representing the details for the interaction between users and                  systems.  Interactions are represented by means of a User                       Interface Notation (UAN) which is being developed for                           communication among persons with various professional backgrounds               involved in various phases of the development cycle of a specific               interface. Experiments will be performed to evaluate an existing                UAN and to develop criteria for new features and capabilities of                the notation.  A theoretical analyses will be done based on                     cognitive theory and relating the approach to other work in                     human-computer interactions.  The results will be integrated into               a set of coherent requirements for the next generation of a UAN.                The requirements will then form the basis for the development of                tools which use the revised UAN.  The tools include an editor and               tools to generate code and skeletal user documentation from a UAN               description of task.",
