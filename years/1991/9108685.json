 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most industrial accidents occur during transient operations                     (start-up, shut down, etc.).  During these periods, it is                       sometimes difficult for operators to determine abnormal                         operating conditions, identify causes of process trends                         (external load disturbances, degradation due to parametric                      changes, sensor and actuator failures, structural faults), and                  plan and schedule a sequence of operating steps.  This                          research project will consist of studying a way to unify                        systems theory with human decision-making knowledge in the                      development of a generic and robust diagnostic methodology for                  fault diagnosis in chemical plants.                                                                                                                             The technique involves integrating experimental knowledge with                  expert systems based on dynamic models of the process.   The                    system structure consists of embedding estimation-based                         techniques of fault detection and isolation within the                          framework of a knowledge-based system.  Raw data are fed to a                   fault detector (a preprocessor) which performs statistical                      tests to identify the process conditions (normal or abnormal).                  The preprocessor triggers the initiation of the knowledge-                      based system.  The task of the knowledge-based system is to                     either identify the false alarm or to determine the source and                  extend of the true fault.  Both a state/parameter estimator                     and a statistical analyzer are included in the loop of                          diagnostic reasoning.  The design methodology is a layered                      knowledge base that houses heuristic knowledge in high levels                   and process-general estimation knowledge in the low levels.                     The diagnostic reasoning alternates between the two domains of                  knowledge.  The algorithm developed will be tested on a                         subsystem of a power plant that includes a deaerator.                                                                                                           This is research planning grant under the Research                              Opportunities for Women Program.",
