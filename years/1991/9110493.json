 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is to pursue a theory of robust control for                        nonlinear systems.  The development of robust control                           techniques for nonlinear systems would provide                                  valuable tools for nonlinear control analysis and design.                       The proposed lines of research are (1) the development                          of gain-scheduling into a systematic design methodology                         and (2) an investigation of input/output properties of                          nonlinear control design methods.  The research on                              gain-scheduling involves a theory for \"Linear                                   Parameter-Varying\" (LPV) systems.  LPV systems form                             the underlying framework for nonlinear gain-scheduled                           control.  A theory for such systems would remove                                gain-scheduling's fundamental limitation to systems                             which evolve slowly.  The research on input/output                              properties of nonlinear control design methods                                  represents an attempt to bring important linear robust                          control concepts to nonlinear systems.  Nonlinear                               control design methods typically rely on state-space                            representations.  An input/output analysis would lead                           to a better understanding of the capabilities and                               limitations of these design methods.",
