 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a joint award with Dr. Vijayshanker at the University of                Delaware.  This team has proposed several major research  tasks                 in natural language processing with special emphasis on  several                mathematical and computational aspects.  The work clearly has a                 formal and mathematical character.  The various  computational                  structures and strategies the team has developed and will                       develop, need to be investigated mathematically because such                    investigations shed light on the descriptive and processing                     powers of these formalisms.  These two aspects, i.e., the                       development of the structures and strategies, and their                         mathematical investigations, are very much interrelated.  It is                 believed that natural language processing backed up by a formal                 framework, and mathematical investigations grounded in empirical                studies are two very productive areas of research.  The                         researcher will focus on interested in mathematical                             investigations only to the extent to which the results have                     important implications for natural language processing.",
