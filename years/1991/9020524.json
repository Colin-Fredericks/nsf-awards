 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in paleontology to                     be conducted by Myrl Beck and others at Western Washington                      University and several Chilean geologists led by Francisco                      Herve of the University of Chile.  Together they will carry                     out a study of the Liquine-Ofqui fault (LOF) which is a                         topographically prominent linear feature that extends more                      than 800 km through the fjords of southern Chile and into the                   active volcanic arc east of the Lake District.  It is thus                      only slightly shorter than the San Andreas fault system of                      California.  Unlike the San Andreas, however, the tectonic                      significance of the LOF is unknown.  The investigators have                     located two large exposures of Cretaceous volcanic rocks on                     either side of the fault, and have obtained test samples that                   have favorable magnetic behavior.  This proposal is for                         funding to do the paleomagnetic part of a multidisciplinary                     study of the LOF; other aspects of the research (geochemistry,                  geochronology, field mapping) are being funded by a grant                       from the Chilean government.                                                                                                                                    Because two U.S. sceintists and six Chileans including two                      graduate students at W.W.U. are invloved, this is a good                        example of collaboration.  Also, because of the education and                   training aspects of the work, it satisfies very well the                        goals of the Science in Developing Countries program.",
