 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transcription termination factor Rho is an ATPase that binds to the             nascent RNA transcript and catalyzes its site-specific release                  within E.coli and coliphage transcription units.  This proposal                 outlines a kinetic and thermodynamic approach with the goal of                  gaining a greater physical understanding of the molecular                       interactions and dynamic processes that occur during the                        termination reaction.  A synthetic paused ternary complex will be               constructed from the E. coli rho attenuator (att) region, an                    important Rho-dependent terminator that is located in front to the              rho gene, and which autogenously regulates the level of Rho in the              bacterial cell.  The use of a recent technique to generate a                    homogeneous population of paused transcription complexes will be                used.  A transcription blockade is created through the binding of               a cleavage-defective EcoR1 mutant endonuclease bound to an                      engineered EcoR1 site placed at strategic locations within the att              region.  The energetics of Rho assembly and the kinetics of                     transcript release will be measured to test key questions about                 the termination reaction.  The RHo binding site on the attenuator               transcript will be determined by RNA footprinting studies using                 primer extension/chemical modification techniques.  The                         relationship between the site of the blockade and the energetics                and kinetics of Rho attachment and transcript release will be                   evaluated.",
