This award will support a 12-month visit by Dr. Charles                         M. Drain of The Rockefeller University with Professor                           Jean-Marie Lehn of Institut Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg,                          France.  Various molecular, spontaneously self assembling                       systems are found in nature: hydrophobic and hydrophilic                        interactions put lipids into liquid crystalline membranes;                      hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions cause                           molecular recognition of DNA base pairs creating specific                       helical structures; and ionic forces arrange solid state                        lattices into crystals.  All rely on molecular recognition                      between complementary components.  As effective electronic                      conduction through a given media requires it be highly                          organized into a specific crystalline or molecular                              lattice, structures difficult to achieve in organic                             polymers and films, Dr. Drain proposes to use self                              assembling systems to create conducting polymers and                            films of synthetic porphyrins.  He will use complementary                       molecular recognition moieties which are derivatives of                         hydrogen bonding molecules already described by Professor                       Lehn.  Dr. Drain will synthesize and characterize three                         sets of porphyrins derivatized with the molecular                               recognition molecules resulting in mono, di, and tetra                          substituted meso-tetra-alkylporphyrins.  The mono-                              substituted and the di-substituted porphyrins should form                       mesomorphic and crystalline phases via two different                            porphyrin intercalation geometries, while the tetra-                            substituted porphyrin should form highly organized                              monolayers on solid supports.  Dr. Drain proposes to                            synthesize, characterize, and examine the physical                              properties of these arrays, including measurement of                            polymeric conductance and photovoltage both in lipid                            bilayers and on solid supports such as tin oxide.
