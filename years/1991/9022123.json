 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the purchase of radio modems and portable                computers for research into radio network (wireless) computer                   systems. The research will concentrate on several aspects of                    wireless communication including: extending the IP protocol to                  handle hosts that are not topologically fixed, techniques for                   handing off from one radio cell to another without data or                      communications loss, intelligent caching to reduce peak loads over              slow radio links, self-organizing load balancing, and distribution              of kernel functionality. Wireless networks provide an attractive                alternative to the expense of running cables between and within                 buildings so long as high communication speeds are not required.                This research is intended to solve some of the problems with                    wireless networks and to build an experimental network at Columbia              University.                                                                          It is very expensive to run wires or fiber optic cables                    between and within buildings. An alternative to cabling is to build             a wireless computer network much like the cellular phone network is             an alternative to the telephone line network. The problems with                 building a wireless computer network are more complex than those                involved in building a wireless voice network. These problems                   include protocols to \"hand off\" communications when cell boundaries             are crossed (with voice, some noise is acceptable, with data this               must be minimized), load balancing methods so that slow radio links             don't get clogged, and distribution of operating system                         functionality to reduce communications. The equipment funded by                 this grant will enable an experimental wireless computer network to             be built. The network will be used to experimentally validate                   communication protocols and to validate algorithms for load                     balancing and other methods needed to reduce communications on the              network.",
