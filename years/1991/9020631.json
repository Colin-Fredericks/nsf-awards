 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program                  Dr. Gary M. Hieftje will continue studies intended to enhance                   the sensitivity, precision, accuracy and degree of utility of                   atomic spectrometric analysis. In one group of investigations,                  specially developed techniques will be employed to eluciate the                 mechanism of solute particle vaporization and atom formation in                 flames and plasmas of the kind used for multielement analysis.                  Clarification of these events is expected to reduce                             interelement interferences caused by incomplete vaporization.                   In a second area of investigation, rare-gas plasmas will be                     studied in an effort to determine how they are responsible for                  excitation of atoms and ions. Particular emphasis will be                       placed on understanding the characteristics of electrons in                     such discharges and the role electrons play in transferring                     plasma energy to analyte atoms and ions.  In the third area,                    the sources of interferences in plasma source-mass spectrometry                 will be investigated. A typical plasma source, the mass                         spectrometer itself, and the interface that separates these                     will be examined in an effort to understand how the mass                        spectrometric sampling process influences a plasma, how the                     atmospheric-pressure gases are extracted through a                              medium-pressure interface into the mass spectrometer, and how                   space-charge effects in the mass spectrometer can influence                     accuracy, precision, and dynamic range in the resulting                         measurement. Finally, the factors that limit the utility of the                 glow-discharge lamp as a source will be explored, with special                  attention to the nature and rate of rare-gas sputtering in such                 sources.                                                                                                                                                        Atomic spectroscopy is a highly sensitive and convenient method                 for the identification and quantitative measurement of metals                   in biological and environmental samples. The results of this                    project are expected to contribute to substantial improvements                  in the utility and accuracy of this method.",
