 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California at Santa Barbara will conduct a                    three-year program to develop K through 8 mathematics                           education leaders from among existing bilingual and minority                    teachers and from among committed teachers in high minority                     population schools in the Santa Barbara area.  Eight Cycle I                    teachers will be enhanced in implementing a hands-on,                           problem-solving approach to mathematics instruction, in                         improving their ability to relate to a culturally diverse                       student population, in developing effective approaches to                       professional development and in developing into teacher                         leaders who will in turn conduct such teacher enhancement                       activities.  The Cycle I teachers will then help enhance an                     additional forty Cycle II teacher-leaders who, together with                    the Cycle I group, will then conduct one- to three-day                          workshops for an additional 370 third cycle teachers and                        administrators.  With informal staff development by the                         teacher-leaders at their home schools, a total of 800 to                        1,000 teachers will be enhancement.                                                                                                                             The program will consist of twenty-one days (13 summer and 8                    academic year) of leadership seminars each year, with Cycle                     I teachers participating in such seminars all three years                       and  Cycle two teachers participating in them the second and                    third years.  The one- to three-day inservice workshops will                    also be held.  The mathematics content of the seminars and                      workshops will focus on geometry, spatial sense and                             patterns, statistics and probability, measurement and                           number.  The percent of cost-sharing by the University of                       California at Santa Barbara and the school districts                            accounts for 31% of the NSF budget.                                                                                                                             This project will provide a model, transportable program to                     enhance the teaching of mathematics in a multicultural                          setting and will document the effectiveness of the model.                       Such a model is urgently needed.",
