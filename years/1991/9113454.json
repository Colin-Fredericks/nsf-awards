 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes PREPnet, the Pennsylvania Research                 and Economic Partnership Network, which presently links thirty-                 nine colleges, universities, government, and private sector                     research and education enterprises to each other and to the                     NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National                Backbone network.                                                                    PREPnet plans to expand its capacity for connecting                        education and research institutions and to extend its services                  into new regions of the state.  This should encourage smaller                   institutions to take advantage of information resources available               on PREPnet itself or through the NSFNET.                                             The items proposed for NSF support include:                                     -Expansion of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia network hubs;                         -Creation of a new network hub in State College, PA;                            -Creation of a new network hub in Meadville, PA;                                -Terminal servers for connecting very small member                         institutions at a reasonable cost;                                                   -Personnel for outreach, marketing, and support of new                     members; and                                                                         -Compensation to the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center for                  NSFNET gateway and network support services.",
