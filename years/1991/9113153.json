 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a research plan to develop a                            time-domain based theory for the characterization of                            minimax controllers for linear and nonlinear                                    finite-dimensional systems with norm-bounded and                                partially stochastic uncertainties, and for the analysis                        of their robustness with regard to modeling                                     inaccuracies and order reduction.  A further topic of                           study will be the characterization of robust controllers                        for a (parametrized) family of plants and under                                 multiple criteria.  The general approach to be adopted                          in this study is that of dynamic or differential game                           theory, which provides the most natural setting for                             these worst-case design problems, in both discrete and                          continuous time, and under different types of                                   measurement schemes.  For each class of problems, a                             relationship will be established between the worst-case                         controller performance and the upper value of a                                 particular zero-sum dynamic game, which will facilitate                         a further robustness analysis in terms of admissibility,                        and sensitivity to unmodeled fast plant dynamics and                            weak subsystem coupling.  The game-theoretic                                    approach will also allow for multiple performance                               criteria and partial stochastic modeling.  Research                             efforts along the lines described in the proposal should                        lead to major advances in the methodology and design                            of worst-case controllers for various types of systems, as                      well as to some new fundamental results in the theory                           of dynamic games.",
