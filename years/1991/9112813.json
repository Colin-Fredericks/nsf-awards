 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop mathematical models of how people                    carry out simple mental tasks that involve more than one type of                information presented simultaneously.  Many theories and models                 in psychology that are able to make definite predictions for                    experiments are very specific and particularistic.  In contract,                this project will continue Townsend's development of general                    mathematical representations of important psychological issues.                 These general mathematical representations will then be used to                 construct decisive experimental tests of the critical questions                 posed by such issues.  The generality of the approach implies                   that these experiments will support or falsify the broadest                     possible potential \"laws\" of behavior, rather than quite specific               and rather limited aspects of such natural regularities.                        Rigorous mathematization of the principles and issues implies                   that the predictions follow rigorously from the assumptions                     embedded in the theory, and that the experimental tests really                  assess what is claimed to be assessed, which is not always true                 in verbally stated theories.                                                                                                                                    This research will move beyond Townsend's recent mathematical                   theories, which are based on the assumption that each successive                stage of the mental endeavor must be completed before the next                  begins.  Although this assumption is very likely correct in a                   number of situations, such as in mental arithmetic, it is                       probably wrong in other tasks where the information may be free                 to flow continuously throughout the involved parts of the brain.                For instance, in the recognition of a familiar face, it may well                be that as sensory information comes in, it simultaneously flows                to visual-long-term-memory centers, to emotional-memory areas,                  and even to areas causing early portions of an action.  Thus, it                may not be necessary to first receive and process the sensation,                then pass on the completed sensory information to a recognition                 device, and so on, in discrete stages.  This research will                      develop models that permit such continuous flow among the various               important parts of the cognitive system.  A second critical                     assumption has been an independence of the separate processing                  stages in cognition.  Again, this may be reasonable in certain                  contexts but not in others.  The research will begin to probe the               question of what happens when this independence is given up and                 the different subprocesses can form serious interactions.                                                                                                       The outcome of such research is vitally needed to construct more                accurate and sophisticated theories of how people perceive and                  think.  This information will be useful for understanding of                    normal mental functioning within the education process as well as               for understanding mental functioning in cases of mental                         disabilitiy or disfunction.",
