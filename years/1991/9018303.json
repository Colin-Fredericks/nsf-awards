 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will develop a generalized three-dimensional model               for the interaction of normal and strike-slip faults during                     continental extension.  The relationship between transverse                     structures (strike-slip faults) and detachment (normal) faults in               southern Nevada will be examined in detail, and a temporal and                  structural history will be established.  To accomplish this, an                 integrated study will be conducted that involves geologic mapping,              geochronology, and seismic reflection profiling across both                     detachment and strike-slip faults.  This collaborative proposal                 with 9017629 which will address the geologic mapping and                        geochronology.  Three classes of models will be tested:                         strike-slip faults ar crust-penetrating, fundamental first order                structures and normal faults are secondary; detachment faults are               first-order structures and strike-slip faults are secondary                     transfer faults in the shallow crust; and, strike-slip and normal               faults are synchronous and allow extension to occur by the                      horizontal translation of crustal blocks.  The results of this                  study will provide fundamental three-dimensional information on                 the mechanisms by which continental crust may extend, and as such               have wide-reaching tectonic importance.",
