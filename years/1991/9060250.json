 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to explore the                                feasibility of exploiting recent advances in the                                understanding of power system voltage relationships                             and phenomena, and in the structuring and application                           of artificial intelligence methodologies, for control of                        power system voltage profiles.  Since the relationship                          between voltage control means and their effects are                             predominantly local in nature, hierarchical structures                          are naturally indicated.  The complexities of the                               problem, including mixed mode controls and radical                              nonlinearities, have defeated practicable                                       implementation of conventional control synthesis.                               Recent advances in artificial intelligence methodologies,                       including artificial neural net applications, suggest that                      their application to this problem might be feasible.  We                        propose to develop an appropriate problem definition,                           and to assess possible training and control strategies,                         including several that have recently been developed or                          suggested in the literature.",
