 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Wyoming for replacement of the Botany Greenhouse                  Facility which houses botany research and research training                     activities.  This building was constructed in 1940 and last                     renovated in 1972.  The ARFMP grant of $575,000 and $745,000                    provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize               these research and research training facilities.  This project                  will address the need to improve the current research                           infrastructure by replacing a facility for which renovation is not              cost effective.  The replacement of the greenhouse and headhouse                will make possible optimal plant research and higher level                      controlled experiments than are currently feasible, and it will                 contribute to the Botany Department's goal of coordinating faculty              to address fundamental questions about photosynthesis and plant                 adaptation.                                                                                                                                                     This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral                   students.  The Departments of Biology and Botany at the University              of Wyoming are in the process of formulating aggressive student                 recruitment protocols that are attracting student majors from the               region.",
