 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his research on                   dynamical systems. In particular he will study the dynamics of                  entire functions, maps associated with Newton's method, and some                antiholomorphic maps. The dynamics of these maps will be applied to             the problem of trying to understand the automorphisms of the shift              map. These techniques will also be applied to other families of                 interest in real dynamics including the Henon map, the standard                 family, and a family of maps which arise in scattering theory.                       Dynamical systems are playing an increasing role in various                subfields of mathematics and in mathematical modeling. One of the               applications to be studied in this project is an application to                 scattering theory. Scattering theory is the branch of mathematics               which attempts to reconstruct an operator from a description of the             action of the operator on functions. It is a basic tool in physics.             The amalgamation of different methods is playing an important role              in the solution of many mathematical and scientific problems; this              project is one example of cross-disciplinary research at work.",
