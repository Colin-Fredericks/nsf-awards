 "awd_abstract_narration": "A course with associated laboratory is being developed by the                   Department of Engineering that will offer to first- and second-                 year students at Swarthmore College an exposure to basic                        scientific and engineering principles through an exploration of                 the acoustics of musical instruments as well as the acoustics                   of the human voice, structures, and the environment.  The                       intended audience is predominantly non-majors in the sciences                   and engineering, although attraction of students to these                       fields is an objective of the course.  Emphasis is placed on                    hands-on analysis by students of phenomena already within their                 experience: how musical instruments (including electric and                     electronic ones and the human voice) produce their                              characteristic sounds, how acoustic waves travel through                        solids, liquids, and gases and are reflected, refracted, and                    absorbed, and how sound and its impact on the environment                       (including humans) is measured and quantified.  Associated                      laboratories allow students to explore phenomena on their own                   in a creative manner, working in groups of 4-5 students.                        Laboratories are designed to teach basic principles such as                     resonance, superposition, time and frequency domain                             representations of signals, wave motion in one, two, and three                  dimensions, and the mechanics of the human ear.",
