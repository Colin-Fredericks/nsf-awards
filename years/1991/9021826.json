 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Saint               Michael's College for the renovation and repair of Cheray Science               Hall which houses research and research training activities in                  the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and in the                      interdisciplinary majors in Biochemistry and Environmental                      Science.  This building was constructed in 1949 and has not been                renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $375,000 and                     $1,046,511 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used                 to modernize these research and research training facilities.                   This project will address the need to improve the current                       research infrastructure by reconfiguring the space and upgrading                the electrical power and heating, ventilation, and air                          conditioning (HVAC) systems.  These modifications will permit an                increase in the continuity and quality, quantity, and diversity                 of the scientific research conducted as well as insure that                     current health and safety standards are met.                                                                                                                    This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of undergraduate students in an institution                    where a large percentage of science majors go on to pursue                      graduate study.",
