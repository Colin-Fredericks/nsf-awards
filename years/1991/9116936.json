 "awd_abstract_narration": "ADMI stands for the Association of Department Heads of                     Computer Science and Engineering Departments at Minority                        Institutions and it was initially organized in 1989 at an                       NSF-funded workshop.  Its fundamental purpose is to increase                    the number of minorities in computer science and computer                       engineering through a variety of activities including the                       development of research and education programs.  With NSF                       support over the past two years ADMI has been able to conduct                   four proposal writing workshops for minority institutions, to                   initiate a visiting scientists program, to incorporate as a                     not-for-profit corporation, to conduct a membership drive,                      and to begin to develop an industrial affiliates program.                       ADMI currently represents about 75 of the 117 minority                          institutions which have departments or programs in computer                     science or computer engineering.  The purpose of the grant is                   to provide enough additional startup support to ADMI for one                    year to allow it to become self-sufficient.  ADMI will                          organize and run a conference on resource issues for                            minority institutions, develop research and educational                         programs for its member institution (including mentoring                        programs), develop fund raising mechanisms, and prepare a                       proposal for the Alliances for Minority Participation                           program.",
