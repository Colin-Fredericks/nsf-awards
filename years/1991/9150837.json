 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miami University Physics Education Program, Introductory Level                  Sequence.A Prototype Project consisting of a three-semester                     sequence of new calculus-based introductory physics courses                     emphasizing laboratoy experience is being developed and                         implemented.  Its intent is to enhance student interest, while                  providing more insight into how physicists think, by                            introducing, as early as possible, advances made in physics in                  the twentieth century.  Featured in the first two semesters are                 major sections on quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and                   special relativity.  The third-semester Contemporary Physics                    course builds on the first two semesters:  it develops basic                    concepts in order to describe recent research results.The                       three-semester sequence serves as the introductory component of                 an undergraduate physics education program, as typified by the                  Freshman and Sophmore years.  The entire sequence is                            appropriate for students majoring in engineering, mathematics,                  and the sciences, and in other technical fields.  However,                      because for many students in majors other than physics the                      first two semesters constitute the only physics course taken,                   these two semesters are designed to stand alone.  They                          introduce ideas of twentieth century physics which can be used                  in advanced courses taken by students in other science and                      technical majors.  The three-semester sequence is designed to                   be transportable to other Colleges and Universities where class                 size is moderate to large.",
