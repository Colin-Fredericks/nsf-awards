 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides undergraduates with the opportunity to                    develop their skills and expertise in experimental Behavioral                   Biology through a series of laboratory experiments with weakly                  electric fish.  The major items of equipment requested include                  six identical sets of equipment composed of a digital storage                   oscilloscope, a microelectrode amplifier, a frequency counter,                  and a function generator.  This equipment is used by the                        students to carry out Animal Behavior Laboratory experiments                    in communication, electrolocation, receptor physiology, and                     physiological behavior.  The students' active participation                     in the design and conduct of such experiments, rather than                      observing a demonstration, enhances their understanding of                      the concepts involved and research methodology, and provides                    an opportunity to become familiar with the type of equipment                    used in modern Behavioral Biology research.",
