 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although it is well known that both phytoplankton and                           heterotrophic bacterioplankton assimilate ammonium in the                       euphotic zone, the controls on bacterial uptake are unclear.                    Little is known about factors controlling the great variation in                relative ammonium uptake by bacterioplankton (10- 60% of total                  ammonium uptake) and nothing about nitrate uptake by bacteria.                  Nitrogen uptake by heterotrophic bacteria can greatly impact our                understanding of new versus regenerated production, which has                   emerged as an important variable in global carbon and nitrogen                  models.  In the subarctic Pacific, for example, about 50% of the                new production can be explained by changes in nitrogen use by                   heterotrophic bacteria.  In order to understand dissolved                       inorganic nitrogen uptake (DIN . which includes ammonium,                       nitrate, and nitrite), this research project will examine uptake                by both phytoplankton and bacteria in relationship to biomass,                  biomass production, and dissolved organic matter uptake.                        Improved methodologies will be utilized to examine algal and                    bacterial dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) uptake and the                     researchers will carry out the project in collaboration with                    ongoing process oriented studies in Oregon coastal waters,                      particularly the California Current system off Oregon.  Previous                results indicate that an extensive range in nutrient                            concentrations, biomass, and production will be encountered.  As                a result of this variation, the researchers expect to observe and               eventually understand changes in DIN uptake by bacteria and to                  provide insight into how the activity of both bacteria and                      phytoplankton should be incorporated into realistic models of                   nitrogen cycling and carbon cycling in the euphotic zone.",
