 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Bordwell                    will develop new methods for estimating the magnitudes of bond                  dissociation energies (BDEs). These studies are expected to                     provide quantitative estimates of the relative magnitudes of                    BDEs and the corresponding radical stabilization energies                       (RSEs) for the species that are formed upon homolytic cleavage                  of bonds between hydrogen and other atoms. His work will                        provide the first quantitative estimates of the relative                        magnitudes of RSEs for a large number of radicals. At the same                  time, these measurements will serve to extend the                               dimethylsulfoxide-based acidity scale, which provides                           quantitative measures of anion basicities and, through the                      Bronsted equation, their reactivities toward electrophiles.                     %%%                                                                             Knowledge of the energies, called \"bond dissociation energies\",                 that are required to cleave particular chemical bonds is                        important to physical-organic chemists who seek to develop                      fundamental structure-activity relationships that can be used                   to predict the reactivities of individual chemical bonds in a                   given molecule toward a particular reagent. This information,                   in turn, can be used by synthetic organic chemists in                           developing new synthetic strategies.",
