 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Lee will study nonlinear partial differential                    equations related to problems in geometry. One of the goals will be             to find complete Einstein metrics on the ball with prescribed                   conformal infinity. A second area of research will be the space of              CR structures on a three dimensional manifold. The work on partial              differential equations will involve an attempt to extend the idea               of the maximum principle to systems. There have been numerous semi-             successful attempts at this in the past and any progress made by                the principal investigator in this direction should find immediate              application.                                                                         This award will support research in the cross disciplinary                 area of global analysis which studies geometry through partial                  differential equations. One of the interesting applications of the              research involves the inverse problem of measuring the conductivity             properties of a material from electrical measurements made on the               boundary of the material. It is possible to reformulate this                    problem as one in differential geometry and then uses methods from              this well developed field to attempt to answer questions concerning             the inverse problem.",
