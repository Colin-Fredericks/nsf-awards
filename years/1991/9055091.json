The Young Scholars will be matched in teams with undergraduate science          majors and research mentors.  The students will work on research-style          projects in chemistry under the direction of the CU-Denver chemistry            faculty.  They will take field trips to visit local industry and                governmental laboratories and governmental science advisory panel               meetings.  Outside speakers will be invited to engage in discussion             sessions with the students concerning research projects they are                involved in, careers in chemistry-related fields, pursuing a career in          science, and the philosophy and ethics of research.                                                                                                             The students will present a traveling science exhibition of their               projects at their schools in the Fall.  The project director,                   accompanied by one or two of the undergraduate students, will provide           chemistry demonstrations for the highs schools throughout the Fall.",
