The main                         topic of the symposium will be the receptor-mediated signal                     transductions which are one of the important events in                          nervous system function.  New advances which were recently                      made regarding the structure, function and regulation of                        G-proteins in nervous system will be examined.  The meeting                     is planned to integrate specific presentations, by means of                     discussions and workshops, so that a synthesis of recent                        advances can be made.  The chairman of the Indian                               organizing committee is Dr.A. Sharma.                                                                                                                           Scope:  This symposium is the 4th in the Indo-U.S.                              neuroscience series.  These bilateral meetings are oriented                     to exchanges of information and presentations of data                           relavent to recent advances in fundamental mechanistic                          neurobiology.  The proposed meeting will help nurture the                       growth of neurosciences in India and identify emerging                          areas where useful collaborative research can be started.                       The area of the meeting is of major current interest in the                     U.S. and the meeting is likely to help the field in the                         U.S. as well as in India.",
