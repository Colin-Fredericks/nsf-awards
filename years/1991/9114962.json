 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global mass-balance considerations, vertical nutrient profiles,                 seasonal nutrient cycles and preliminary silica flux data all                   indicate the large subtropical mid-ocean gyres may account for                  the majority of the global oceanic production of biogenic silica.               Diatoms are  reported to bloom episodically in summer in                        response to mixing events.  However, the available evidence                     suggests that most of the annual silica production occurs during                extended periods of low primary productivity and low diatom                     abundance in summer and autumn.  While virtually all of this                    silica is redissolved within the water column, the most                         conservative estimates of the export of silica out of the upper                 150m indicate that it is considerable in global terms.                                                                                                          This project represents a seasonal study of the production,                     redissolution and vertical transport of biogenic silica in the                  Sargasso Sea in conjunction with the U.S. JGOFS time-series                     observations southeast of Bermuda.  The study will address two                  major objectives: (1) to evaluate the role of the oligotrophic                  mid-ocean gyres in the global oceanic silica cycle, and (2) to                  assess the importance of the siliceous phytoplankton in new                     production and the vertical export of organic matter in these                   areas.  This study will obtain year-round data for three years on               the vertical flux of particulate silica at the JGOFS time-series                site and will measure silica production and dissolution rates in                the upper ocean at key times of year.  These measurements will be               joined with the planned JGOFS time-series core measurements of                  dissolved silicic acid and particulate silica to achieve the                    first full seasonal study of the cycling of silica in the ocean.",
