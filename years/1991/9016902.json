 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of six US scientists                      in a joint US-Japan seminar on \"Biology of the Epidermis,\"                      July 21-25, 1991 in Sapporo, Japan.  The co-organizers are                      Professor Joseph McGuire, Department of Dermatology, Stanford                   University School of Medicine, and Professor Akira Ohkawara,                    Department of Dermatology, Hokkaido University School of                        Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.  Specific topics to be discussed at                   the seminar include (1) stratum corneum and extracellular                       lipids; (2) structural proteins of the epidermis; (3)                           regulation of proliferation and differentiation, vitamin D3,                    growth factors and cytokines; and (4) expression of oncogenes                   by keratinocytes. This will be the fifth seminar on this                        subject since 1976.  These seminars have played an important                    role in fostering and promoting interactions between US and                     Japanese dermatologists and skin researchers.  Because much                     information on the epidermis has become known since the last                    seminar in 1985, the proposed seminar is particularly timely.                                                                                                                                                                                   The epidermis covers the entire human body, protecting                          internal organs and maintaining human homeostasis.  In order                    to perform protection and maintenance of proper homeostasis,                    the epidermis possesses highly organized features and                           functions.  Much research has been undertaken to try to                         understand these, concentrating on defining the morphological                   and biochemical properties of the epidermis.  The field is                      expanding rapidly, particularly in the areas of molecular                       biology and regulation of cell growth and differentiation.                      Significant contributions are currently being made to the                       field of skin science, which should eventually lead to the                      resolution of the pathogenesis of various skin diseases.                        Because the seminar will address topics where significant                       recent advances have been made, the meeting should bring the                    U.S. and Japanese research communities up to date and                           stimulate future collaborative projects.",
