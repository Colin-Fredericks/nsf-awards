 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal for doctoral dissertation research examines the                   technology and social organization of Greenlandic whaling, the                  interpenetration of cash and subsistence sectors in local                       economies, and the impact of dynamic whaling regulatory regimes on              Greenlandic hunters.  The International Whaling Commission's                    reduction of minke whale harvests has had a considerable impact on              Greenlandic communities.  The Greenlandic situation is typical of               the conflicts between Inuit communities, and other subsistence-                 based societies in the Arctic, and the interests of environmental               protection organizations and development concerns.  Although                    critics have challenged the validity of traditional Inuit whaling               and emphasized the emergence of internal markets, the Greenlanders              argue for the cultural and socioeconomic significance of whaling                and its sustainability.  The present research seeks to understand               the articulation and contradiction between Inuit and Euroamerican               perspectives about the use of natural resources and sustainable                 development in the circumpolar north.  The project draws upon                   theoretical and methodological approaches derived from political                economics and natural resources anthropology.",
