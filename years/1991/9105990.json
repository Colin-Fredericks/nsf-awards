 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long range goals of this research are to define at the                      molecular level the expression of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)              genome. Specific focus has been on the regulation of expression of              three representative early transcription units including the major              2.7 kb and 1.2 kb RNAs and the 2.2kb family of transcripts.  In                 this application, the PI proposes to continue studies on the cis-               acting sequences and trans-acting factors (both viral and cellular)             necessary for the control of these three early genes.  For these                studies, site-directed mutagenesis and in vivo transient expression             assays will be coupled with DNA-protein binding and in vitro                    transcription assays. To elucidate the means by which specific HCMV             immediate early gene products (particularly those expressed by the              IE1 and IE2 regions) activate transcription of early genes. The                 proteins will be overexpressed, purify them to homogeneity, and                 analyze  their biochemical interaction with the early promoter                  elements as well as with the basic RNA polymerase II transcription              machinery. The proposed studies are important not only to advance               the knowledge of the regulation of the viral life cycle, but also               to help elucidate the general mechanisms that operate to control                eukaryotic gene expression.",
