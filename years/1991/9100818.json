 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site grant.                   The award permits undergraduate students to participate in a                    research program in the materials field under the supervision of                faculty members actively engaged in research.  Recruitment of                   students places strong emphasis upon females, with sources being                University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham                   College, Seaton Hill College, and Carlow College.  The latter                   three are female colleges in the Pittsburgh area.  Students who                 succeed in the summer program can then continue to participate                  informally during the academic year if they desire.  The award                  supports up to six students.  The goal of the research is to                    allow students to create \"electronic laboratories\" in which they                can model behavior of complex molecular fluids.  Models used                    include Monte Carlo computer simulations of aggregation and                     adsorption of thin films of polymers on surfaces and interfaces,                and subsequently to relate the microstructure of the polymer                    chains to the macroscopic properties of the films.  The program                 lets students begin with existing models and progress to                        independent research where they generate models themselves under                the supervision of a faculty member. The program enhances current               research activities as well as adding to the number of                          scientifically trained individuals.  It is hoped that this hands-               on experience will serve as a stimulus to attract and retain                    highly-gifted students into careers in teaching and research.",
