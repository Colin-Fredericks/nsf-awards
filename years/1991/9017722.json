 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cytoplasmic hemoglobins characteristic of nearly all bivalves and               gastropod molluscs in which chemoautotrophic bacteria are present               as internal symbionts appear vital to the symbiosis.  Three such                hemoglobins, from gills of the clam Lucina,  have been isolated                 and their interactions with either sulfide or oxygen determined.                The role(s) of these hemoglobins in the symbiotic association will              now be examined using broken-cell systems containing symbiotic                  bacteria, kpurified gill hemoglobins, sulfide, and oxygen.  The                 molecular mechanisms of cytoplasmic hemoglobin-mediated oxygen                  delivery and sulfide delivery to the bacterial symbionts will be                studied; the effects of reduction of either heme or the ligand on               ligand dissociation will be examined.  Our understanding of the                 means whereby the bacteria utilize carbon dioxide using energy                  gained from sulfide oxidation, thus supporting life of this clam                and other similar macrobes should be enhanced by these studies.                                                                                                 The particular roles and mechanisms whereby hemoglobins, present                in the cytoplasm of certain marine invertebrates in which an                    unusual symbiosis involving internalized chemoautotrophic bacteria              exists, will be studied in terms of the ability of the                          invertebrate's hemoglobins to transport oxygen and sulfide to the               bacteria.  This inter-dependence of micro- and the macro-organism               is an increasingly recognized one; an understanding of the means                whereby sulfide, toxic to the invertebrate, reaches the symbiont                and is protected from oxygen should be enlarged by this study.  //",
