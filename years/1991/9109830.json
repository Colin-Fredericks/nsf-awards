 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a need for compact, high-power sources for                             radar applications in the microwave and millimeter-                             wave range.  The output power levels of solid-state                             devices in this frequency range are limited.  A                                 possible solution to be explored in this Research                               Initiation Grant is to coherently combine the outputs                           of hundreds of active devices that load a two-                                  dimensional metal grid with a period equal to a                                 fraction of a free-space wavelength.  This active                               surface is an antenna as well as source.  The devices                           can be MESFETs arranged in a gate-feedback                                      configuration.  This type of oscillator has a wide                              frequency tuning range, as is required in most                                  applications.  The oscillating active surface is backed                         with a tuning mirror that has an electrically variable                          reflection coefficient.  This mirror is another metal                           grid loaded with varactor diodes.  The capacitance of                           the diodes, and therefore the reflection coefficient of                         this tuning surface, is bias dependant.  The mirror                             provides positive feedback to the oscillator surface,                           which is necessary for the devices to lock to a single                          mode.  In a radar, for example, the signal is usually                           transmitted in pulses.  In cases when the transmitter                           itself cannot be switched on and off at a high rate, a                          switching active surface can be used.  This surface                             consists of a grid loaded with pin diodes, and it                               electrically switches the wave transmitted from the                             oscillator grid.  This system is compact and light                              weight, since it consists of a stack of planar dielectrics                      loaded with solid-state devices that do not require                             large power supplies.  It is versatile, for example,                            another active surface of Schottky diodes placed in                             parallel with the oscillator could have a variable                              phase shift for beam steering or beam forming                                   applications, or can be used as a multiplier.  In                               addition, the planar structure is suitable for wafer-                           scale or modular integration.",
