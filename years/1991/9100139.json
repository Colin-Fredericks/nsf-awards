 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal seeks to develop a novel method for the analysis                   of radiation scattering data from a broad class of materials,                   ranging from atomic to supramolecular.  The method seeks to                     obtain the details of the effective interatomic or                              interparticle forces to an extent which has not been possible                   previously, and is useful at conditions at which such forces                    dominate interfacial phenomena and macroscopic behavior and                     properties of the materials.  The focus of the work is in the                   study of colloidal materials and micellar and microemulsion                     systems.  However, the potential impact of the work is broader                  and can be applied to the study of simple liquids and liquid                    metals as well as structurally arrested materials such as gels                  and glasses.  This work will be coordinated with x-ray,                         neutron, and light scattering studies currently in progress.",
