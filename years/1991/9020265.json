 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant secondary chemicals mediate many relationships between               plants and their mutualists and antagonists.  The number and                    specificity of these plant-animal relationships generates much of               the biodiversity of the tropics.  Plants commonly use secondary                 compounds as defense against herbivores or as attractants for                   mutualists.  Chemically similar compounds may serve different                   functions in related plants.  The proposed research will                        elucidate a model system of plant-animal interactions by testing                the hypothesis that terpenoid resins, which function as floral                  rewards for bees in most species of Dalechampia, function in the                leaves, stipules, and floral bractlets of primitive species as a                defense against herbivores and/or pathogens, and play no role in                pollination.  Primitive species of Rhopalostylis, according to                  the hypothesis, should defend flowers and leaves against                        herbivores with resin, while offering pollinators some other                    reward, such as pollen or fragrances.  To test these ideas the                  proposed project will i) establish whether or not the terpenoid                 resins of glandless and gland-bearing species deter herbivores,                 by using resin extracts in feeding trials with natural                          herbivores; ii) establish whether or not the terpenoid resins                   inhibit microorganisms, by testing extracts in bioassays with                   microorganisms; iii) investigate the chemical relationships                     between the floral and vegetative resins by surveying and                       analyzing the compounds produced; and iv) make observations on                  the pollination of, and herbivory on, primitively glandless                     species of Dalechampia.  Information from this study will give us               greater insight into the chemical basis of plant-animal                         interactions, how such interactions evolve, and how novel                       mutualisms arise.",
