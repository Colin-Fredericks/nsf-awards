 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study will be made of the effect of silica gel- and alumina-                  mediated electrophilic addition reactions to alkenes and alkynes.               In order to obtain a better understanding of the mechanistic                    features of this synthetically useful technique, a systematic                   study of the interaction of organic substrates with alumina and                 silica surfaces and the effects of those interactions on                        electrophilic additions to the substrates will be made. Particular              attention will be given to delineating previously observed                      differences between alumina and silica gel surfaces in mediating                electrophilic addition reactions, including differences in the                  steric demands of the active sites, and to developing techniques                for effecting selective addition to one double or triple bond in                the presence of another. A major study of the effects of polar                  substituents on surface-mediated electrophilic additions to                     alkenes and alkynes will also be undertaken, with special                       attention to directive effects of the substituents which may                    induce chemo-, regio-, or stereoselective additions of                          hydrohalides, halogens, water, hydrazoic acid, and hydrogen                     cyanide.                                                                        %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       research of Professor Paul J. Kropp at the University of North                  Carolina. Preliminary studies by Dr. Kropp have shown that                      surfaces of alumina and silica gel can dramatically affect the                  addition of various compounds to double and triple carbon-carbon                bonds. In the present study, the intimate details of alumina and                silica gel mediated addition reactions will be investigated. The                size of substituents bonded to double and triple carbon-carbon                  bonds, as well as the electron density in these multiple bonds,                 will be studied with regard to the possible courses that the                    addition reaction may take. The results of these studies will lead              to important applications in synthetic methods for the preparation              of organic molecules.",
