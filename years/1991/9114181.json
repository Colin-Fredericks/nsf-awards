Sauls of the Chemistry                      Department, King's College, for research on precursors to mixed                 titanium and aluminum nitride ceramics.  Titanium and                           titanium-aluminum compounds with amide and hydrazide bridging                   groups will be prepared and characterized using NMR, ESR, X-ray                 diffraction and electron microscopy.  Oligomeric and polymeric                  aluminum- and titanium-containing species and mixed-metal                       compounds will be pyrolyzed to form the ceramics.  The research                 will be done in collaboration with Dr. Leonard V. Interrante of                 the Chemistry Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.                     %%%                                                                             Ceramic materials containing titanium and aluminum nitride have                 potential as semiconductors and abrasives.  Although some                       materials of this type have been prepared by carbothermal                       reduction and by sputtering techniques, they have not been                      obtained by pyrolysis of an orgamometallic precursor, a method                  which has been shown effective in preparing high purity                         non-oxide ceramics of controlled composition.  In this                          research, suitable precursors will be prepared and their                        behavior upon pyrolysis will be studied.  Fundamental                           information on bonding between titanium and aluminum and                        nitrogen will also be obtained.",
