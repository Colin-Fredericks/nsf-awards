 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Paul Hasegawa, Department of Horticulture, Purdue University,                   and Drs. T. J. Flowers and A. R. Yeo, School of Biological                      Sciences, University of Sussex, England.  The objective of                      the proposed project is to study the response of the plasma                     membrane and tonoplast ATPase to salt stress.                                                                                                                   Salinity is a major factor limiting agricultural production,                    since it reduces yields in land under cultivation. Salt                         tolerance in plants involves the integration of mechanisms at                   all levels of cytological and anatomical organization.                          Mechanisms of critical importance are those which function                      to regulate the rate of ion accumulation and mediate the                        effects of high ion accumulation, yet promote sufficient                        solute uptake for osmotic adjustment necessary for growth in                    the new osmotic environment. It is reasonable to envisage                       that the plasma membrane and the tonoplast have central roles                   in regulated solute accumulation and compartmentation.                          However, experimental results have not defined the physi-                       ological or biochemical roles of the plasma membrane and                        tonoplast in plasma membrane.  This project will focus on the                   plasma membrane and tonoplast H+ -  translocating ATPases                       because of their central roles in the generation of the H+                      electrochemical gradient across the respective membranes, which                 mediates facilitated transmembrane solute import into the                       cell.  The objective of this project is to provide evidence                     regarding the significance of these H+ - pumps in the                           regulation of solute import into the plant during regimes of                    salt imposition.  This project will benefit from the                            complementary expertise of the US and British investigators                     in molecular biology and physiology of salt stress.  The                        results of this research may have important economic                            implications for agriculture.",
