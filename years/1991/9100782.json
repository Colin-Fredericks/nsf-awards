 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a program of Research Experiences for                  Undergraduates focusing on problems arising in the mathematical                 theory of algebraic topology.  Six students will join with the                  principal investigator in a nine-week activity designed to                      develop and implement algorithms to search for a certain kind of                topological construct called a cell complex.  Cell complexes                    arise in the study of topological spaces that are higher-                       dimensional versions of the sphere, torus, polyhedra, etc. One                  constructs cell complexes (also known as CW-complexes) from                     elementary building blocks by combining cells together in                       prescribed ways.  Questions about cell complexes translate into                 questions about algebraic objects, Abelian groups, which can be                 represented as matrices.  Matrices are ideal tools for                          representing matrices and the operations between them.  The                     complexes of interest are those called nilpotent.  It is                        difficult to see how to put cells together to get nilpotent                     complexes, but computers - properly programmed - can construct                  multitudes of examples.  This particular project seeks to answer                a basic unsolved problem about the existence of finite three-                   dimensional nilpotent complexes.                                                     The program first introduces the students to topological                   concepts not normally encountered in undergraduate courses.                     Then, exploiting results of students discovered on prior REU                    projects, the team will seek to improve existing algorithms and                 codes to increase their speed and scope.  The final tasks will be               to find new and more complex examples.  Either a group with a                   finite fundamental group will turn up or else, an idea for a                    proof of their non-existence will be suggested.  In either event,               the program will provide of full measure of sense of a research                 experience to the students.",
