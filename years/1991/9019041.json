 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preserved plant and animal specimens in natural history                    museums and herbariums are critical resources for biological                    research.  Systematists, ecologists, biogeographers, and                        investigators from many other fields rely on these specimens and                the data associated with them.  Most specimens are accompanied by               information concerning their geographic location, but most                      commonly these locality data are in the form of narrative                       descriptions, rather than standardized map coordinates such as                  latitude and longitude.  Dr. Matthew McGranaghan, a geographer,                 proposes to develop new computer software that will use an expert               system approach to interpreting these text-based locality                       descriptions into map coordinates.  The software will call on                   electronic gazetteers and digitized maps that are currently                     available.  The proposed software will be tested on label data                  from the plant collections in the Bishop Museum of Natural                      History of Hawaii.                                                                   Biologists are keenly interested in understanding the                      geographic distributions of organisms, but it is prohibitively                  time-consuming to plot individual specimens on maps.  The                       proposed software development effort has the potential to make                  hundreds of millions of museum specimens readily available to                   researchers working on problems of geographic distribution.  This               effort will have wide impact in the museum research community, in               geography and regional sciences, and in the development of                      artificial intelligence applications in biology.",
