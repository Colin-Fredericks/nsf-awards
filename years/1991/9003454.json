 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heating of the ionosphere with intense radio waves has been                pursued vigorously over the last thirty years, primarily in the                 United States and the Soviet Union.  New, large facilities have                 been constructed in the United States and in Europe.  During the                1970's, the branches of plasma physics known as weak turbulence                 theory and the theory of parametric instabilities were used to                  explain some of the unusual and unexpected results of the heating               efforts.  The PIs' recent work, inspired by Petviashvili and                    followed by that of DuBois, Rose, and others, has demonstrated                  the importance of modulational instability followed by Langmuir                 soliton formation and collapse.  The PI proposes to continue his                study of these effects using analytical and numerical techniques.",
