 "awd_abstract_narration": "This will try to identify homologous regions of the                        polydnaviruses from different parasitic wasp groups in an attempt               to determine the phylogenetic affinities of the viruses.  These                 trees can then be compared to those of the wasps for congruence                 testing.  The polydnavirus association with the wasps is an                     extremely interesting relationship and represents the only known                example of mutualism between eukaryotes and viruses.  It appears                that the virus is necessary for the wasp to successfully complete               its lifecycle since the products that it produces successfully                  suppresses the host immune response to the parasitoids.  A                      determination of when this trait arose and if it is lineage                     specific would be highly valuable to a wide range of individuals                in the scientific community and may also have wide ranging effects              in the insect control community.  The procedures to be attempted                are new and offer a high potential return if the project is                     successful.",
