The                results of this research will provide fundamental information                   about the exact mode by which organic molecules undergo thermal                 reactions and rearrangements. One  of the questions to be answered              is, are there short-lived intermediates in these processes or do                they occur in a one step process without intermediates? Knowledge               of these processes is important to a basic understanding of                     organic chemistry.                                                                                                                                              Dr. Gajewski's research will provide basic information about                    thermal reactions and rearrangements in several areas. There is a               concern that the preferred suprafacial-inversion stereochemistry                in methylvinyl cyclopropanes is determined by substituent effects               rather than by orbital symmetry. An attempt will be made to                     resolve this question by the use of deuterium isotope effects.                  Another phase of the research deals with oxyanionic vinyl                       cyclopropane and cyclobutane rearrangements, where two orbital                  symmetry allowed concerted reactions and a stepwise reaction are                possible. Deuterium isotope effects will be used to sort out these              possible mechanisms as a function of solvent and counterion. In                 addition, substituent effects on Cope rearrangements will be                    studied and the question of double rotation in the thermolysis of               spiropentane geometric isomerization will be pursued.",
