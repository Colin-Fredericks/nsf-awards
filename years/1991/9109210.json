 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although powerful, the transaction model adopted in traditional                 database systems is found lacking in functionality and                          performance when used for applications that involve reactive,                   long-lived and collaborative activities.  The following are some                of the issues that arise in the context of the extended                         transaction models that have been proposed to address this lack:                correctness properties of a model vis a vis visibility,                         consistency, recovery, and permanence (e.g., traditional                        transactions guarantee failure atomicity, serializability, and                  permanence.); similarities  and differences between two                         transaction models; constraints on using two models in                          conjunction; and, mechanisms needed for managing extended                       transactions.  These issues motivated the development of ACTA, a                comprehensive formalism which characterizes the effects of                      transactions on each other and on objects in the database.                      ACTA's ability to deal with existing extended transaction models                and correctness notions is indicative of its generality.  The                   need for extended transactions emerges from the demands of                      applications, such as CAD/CAM, software development environments,               object-oriented databases, and distributed operating systems. By                providing a formal framework in which to capture the properties                 of extended transactions, and thereby identifying the needed                    transaction management mechanisms, this work is producing results               that will impact these information-intensive application areas.",
