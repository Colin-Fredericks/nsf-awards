 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has become evident that for a proper understanding of public                 debates about technology policy, it is necessary to take into                   account the normative values at issue as well as the technical                  concerns.  This study will contribute to our understanding of the               way normative values and technical knowledge, as a tightly linked               package, influence and are used in political conflict over                      technology.  In examining the case of solar energy, the project                 will synthesize a theoretical framework that explains both the                  dynamics and the complex linkages between normative values and                  scientific knowledge in the policy process.  It should also                     illuminate an interesting and important recent episode -- the                   swift rise of solar energy in funding  and visibility within the                government, in response to the energy crisis, and its swift fall                back into obscurity.  The analysis of documents will be the                     principal methodological tool.  Energy policy in general and                    solar energy in particular are richly documented issue areas,                   replete with books, articles, reports, and congressional                        hearings.  The specific values involved in this controversy will                be brought out in association with policy options, and the                      driving force of these associations will be examined in the                     course of the research.  Results will be widely disseminated in                 journal articles on both solar energy policy and theoretical                    issues involved in studying value conflicts in technology policy.               In addition, the investigator plans to produce a monograph as a                 contribution to the scholarly literature and to present reports                 of results at relevant professional society meetings.                                                                                                           This proposal is a modest request for support to enable a                       talented young scholar to investigate the close links between                   values and scientific knowledge in a particular debate over                     technology policy.  The principal investigator is well qualified;               institutional support is very good; the research design shows                   originality and is well worked out; dissemination is likely to be               broad and to reach appropriate audiences.  Support is highly                    recommended.",
