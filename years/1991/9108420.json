 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of study of the solid/solution interface will be                      performed involving the preparation of well defined colloidal                   dispersions, studies of chemical reactions in aerosols, and                     particle-particle interactions.  Special emphasis will be                       placed on the preparation and characterization of particles                     consisting of more than one cation.  The relationship of the                    composition of the solid phase to that of the solution will be                  examined.  Coated particles having different surfaces and cores                 will be examined with a view to developing particles with                       surfaces containing high value components.    The interaction                   between particles of different composition, size and surface                    potential in media of varying ionic strength will be examined                   both experimentally and theoretically.                                                                                                                          %%%                                                                                                                                                             The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                     Chemistry, focuses on the study of chemical reactions at                        solid/solution interfaces and in aerosols.  The project                         promises to extend our understanding of colloidal particles.                    The outcome of this research has considerable practical                         applications impacting on several important technologies (e.g.                  ceramics, paints, catalysis).",
