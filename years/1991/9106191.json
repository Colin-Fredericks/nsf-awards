A two-day presentation of technical papers                           was held.  For the first time, the 1990 ManTech                                 Conference was not held in conjunction with the                                 International GaAs Integrated Circuit (IC)                                      Symposium, but instead was structured as a full-                                fledged stand-alone conference with a high                                      interactive workshop environment.                                               Because of the enthusiastic evaluation of the                                   Conference by the attendees, the Sixth U.S.                                     Conference on GaAs Manufacturing Technology                                     has been organized and will again be held                                       April 7-10, 1991 in Reno Nevada.  A considerable                                expansion of the Conference's scope has been                                    authorized by the Executive Committee in response                               to widespread suggestions from attendees to include                             a vendor exhibition and a special workshop on                                   microwave and digital testing.",
