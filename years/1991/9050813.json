 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to acquaint the engineering student                  with modern methods used in the acquisition of experimental data                and in the automatic control of experimental events or industrial               processes.  The specific goals are: to introduce modern data                    acquisition techniques in a undergraduate fluid mechanics and                   heat transfer laboratories and to facilitate real-time computer                 analysis of experimental data.                                                                                                                                  To accomplish these goals, the following instrumentation is being               sought: an Automatic Data Acquisition System (ADAS), various                    sensors and transducers to interface with the ADAS, a printer and               plotter for outputing the data, and equipment to construct a                    pressure transducer calibration system.                                                                                                                         The project is important for the following reasons: by                          streamlining the analysis of experimental data, the exposition of               the fundamental physical principles of fluid flow and heat                      transfer will be enhanced for engineering students, opportunities               for creative undergraduate student projects/research with                       subsonic and supersonic windtunnels will be broadened and the                   engineering student will be trained in the use of the ADAS by                   generating computer software for analyzing and presenting                       experimental data acquired in various fluid flow phenomena.",
