 "awd_abstract_narration": "A detailed understanding of the dynamic internal motion of                      globular proteins is of fundamental importance to a knowledge                   of the structure/function relationships of proteins.  Dr. Schuh                 has recently discovered that quenching of the phosphorescence                   of 6-bromo-2-naphthyl sulfate by the heme of heme proteins can                  be used to assess transient openings in cytochrome c and                        myoglobin.  The rate constant for quenching, kq, is determined                  from lifetime measurements of laser-induced phosphorescence and                 is used to estimate the extent to which motion of heme proteins                 makes the prosthetic heme rings accessible.  If 1-bromopyrene,                  bromoanthracenes, 9-bromophenanthrenes, and eosin, are found                    to be suitable phosphorescent probes, it is proposed that the                   correlation of kq with the size of the molecular probe be used                  to estimate the size of transient openings in the heme proteins                 myoglobin, hemoglobin, cytochromes c and cytochrome c                           peroxidase.                                                                                                                                                     The ultimate goals are to: 1) estimate the size of transient                    fluctuations in proteins, 2) determine whether accessibility                    of the heme ring in redox proteins is important for the flow                    of electrons in and out of the proteins, and 3) determine the                   importance of transient changes in tertiary structure of the                    oligomers of hemoglobin during the binding and release of                       dioxygen molecules.  The achievement of these goals will                        improve our understanding of structure/function relationships                   in proteins.",
