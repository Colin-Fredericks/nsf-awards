 "awd_abstract_narration": "Desalination of ocean water is a major way to provide fresh                     water to communities along coastal and arid regions.                            Desalination plants existing in these areas are typically                       either multi-stage flash evaporators or reverse osmosis                         operations.  While both methods have advantages, there are                      also disadvantages that affect their efficiency.  The use of a                  high frequency electric field for heating of salt water to                      accelerate evaporation would eliminate some of the                              disadvantages of the distillation methods of desalination.                      This method would reduce corrosion which is a major problem in                  the flash evaporators.  Furthermore, this will allow for a                      rapid on-off operation of the system which would give better                    utilization of electric facilities.                                                                                                                             In this project, the evaporation kinematics of streamlets of                    brine under the influence of 100mHz electric fields is being                    studied.  If the high frequency field significantly lowers the                  barrier to evaporation in the brine, this project may                           introduce a wholly new technology in the area of desalinating                   water for agriculture and human consumption.",
