 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States is now reaching the end of its second decade of               virtually zero growth in productivity in the service sector.  The               purpose of this research is to determine and analyze the reasons                for this unsatisfactory performance, with its threatening                       implications for the future growth of the American standard of                  living.                                                                                                                                                         This project is divided into three major components.  The first                 consists of an international comparison of differences in                       productivity measurement-methods.  Some facts of measurement                    favor the U.S., particularly in the manufacturing sector, where                 the U.S. is almost unique in its use of a hedonic price index for               computers.  Other considerations help to account for a poor U.S.                performance and the more favorable foreign performance in non-                  manufacturing, particularly the greater use in foreign accounts                 of physical measures of output in such industries as                            construction, transportation, banking, and finance.  This                       research will develop a coherent account of differences in                      measurement methods in the U. S. and four other leading nations.                                                                                                The second part of the project analysis the causes for the                      differences productivity performance, particularly the hypothesis               that labor in U.S. service industries is poorly paid, leading to                a high use of labor relative to some European countries where the               relative wage in the services is higher and the use of labor                    relatively lower.  The hypothesis will be tested in a comparison                of wage and productivity performance across industries and                      countries.  The final component will consist of detailed studies                of individual U.S. industries which raise a combination of                      measurement and substantive issues.  Building on previous work                  that yielded new insights on productivity behavior in the U.S.                  transportation and utility industries, this part of the project                 will focus on banking, finance, and retailing.",
