 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the study of the electronic                     properties of thermodynamically stable quasicrystals.  Recent                   results have shown several of these icosahedral crystals possess                unusual electronic properties which may be related to exotic                    electronic states predicted by theorists.  The present research                 aims to study the structural, atomic-potential and                              dimensionality effects by measuring the magneto-conductivity,                   thermopower, Hall effect, and specific heat of several selected                 and well characterized two- and three-dimensional quasicrystals                 and their amorphous and crystalline analogs.  The possibliity of                establishing localized states in the supposedly metallic                        quasicrystals with strong atomic potentials will be examined.                   The study will continue to investigate fine structure in the                    density-of-states, which is central to recent theoretical                       predictions.  The magnetic phases of 2D and 3D quasicrystals and                in the new aluminum glasses with both well defined magnetic sites               and localized moments by neutron scattering and magnetic                        measurements.  Spin structures in real-space and in hypercubic                  lattices will be analyzed.",
