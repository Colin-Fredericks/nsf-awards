 "awd_abstract_narration": "Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), and the Cleveland Education           Fund have formed a partnership with the Cleveland Public Schools to             assist the district improve its elementary science program.  The                primary goal of the collaborative project is to build the Cleveland             Public Schools' capacity to employ a staff development model which              will lead to the implementation of an exemplary inquiry-based science           program.  It is anticipated that by the end of the project every                elementary school in the city will have selected a new hands-on                 science program and have an informed principal and a team of teachers           ready to support others in their building as they implement the new             program.  The project provides an opportunity to examine in depth the           change process required in a system which is firmly committed to                decentralization and school-based management at the same time that it           is attempting to change the way science is taught in each elementary            school.  It is, therefore, anticipated that the project's assessment            will increase our understanding of effective staff development models           for both enhancing the teaching of elementary science and for                   assuring the successful institutionalization of inquiry-based science           programs.                                                                                                                                                       The cost sharing for the project will be almost 400% of the NSF                 portion.",
