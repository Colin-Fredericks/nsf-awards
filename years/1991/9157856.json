 "awd_abstract_narration": "The encapsulation of biologically active substances into                        membranes has emerged as an important research area with great                  potential for industrial applications.  These systems permit                    entrapped substances to be protected in vivo from inactivation                  or degradation and also permit delayed or controlled kinetics                   of release.  Systems which employ naturally occurring                           substances as carriers, such as phospholipid vesicles and                       resealed erythrocyte membranes, have certain advantages with                    respect to biocompatibility.  However, a major drawback of                      these carrier systems is their lack of specificity in site of                   delivery.  If this could be solved, great strides in their use                  would be made.  Two of the most important physical properties                   that can effect in vivo survival and targeting of these                         systems are deformability and adhesion.  It has been shown                      that large phospholipid vesicles become entrapped in the first                  capillary bed reached after i.v. administration and they also                   have difficulty in moving from the circulation into the                         interstitial space.  It is possible that these problems could                   be attributed to their lack of deformability.  Intact                           erythrocytes are able to deform during passage through                          capillaries and into the interstitial space.  However, it is                    possible that the morphology of these cells change drastically                  following the incorporation of molecules into the resealed                      erythrocyte.  To date, the deformation characteristics of                       these systems have not been quantified.  Targeting of these                     carriers to specific cells in vivo also depends a great deal                    on carrier-endothelial cell interactions during dissemination                   through the circulation and carrier-cell interactions                           following extravasation into the tissue space.  These                           interactions are strongly dependent on the adhesion properties                  of the systems.  Hence, it is possible that specific targeting                  could be accomplished by modifying the adhesion properties of                   the carriers.                                                                                                                                                   Current research is focused on the investigation of                             deformability and adhesion properties of both normal and                        genetically altered cells.  The laboratory is equipped with a                   state-of-the-art video microscopy system that employs the                       micropipette aspiration technique and a microscopic flow                        chamber to quantify both deformation and adhesion properties                    of membranes, respectively.  Recent results show that                           genetically altering normal fibroblast cells, modify membrane                   adhesion and deformability properties.  The cells are                           currently being tested, using biochemical assays, to determine                  the adhesion molecules and structural characteristics                           responsible for the properties observed.  During the period of                  the PYI award, expertise in cellular membranes will be                          employed to investigate adhesion, deformation and transport                     properties of resealed erythrocytes membranes and phospholipid                  vesicles with the ultimate goal of producing optimal carrier                    systems.",
