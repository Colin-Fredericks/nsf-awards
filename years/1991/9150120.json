 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to develop six Guides for teachers (three                 each for elementary and middle-school grades).  Each Guide will                 contain about ten hands-on science activities suitable for from                 ten to twelve weeks of study.  The activities will present many                 sciences and some non-science disciplines that are naturally                    linked and integrated by a research discipline that uses all of                 them, SETI--\"Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence\".  The                    activities in each Guide will be organized to begin with a look                 at the Earth, solar system, and universe, then examine questions                about life on Earth.  This segments ends with questions and                     imaginative constructs on the possibility of life elsewhere in                  the universe.  In so doing, they will present biology, Earth                    science, physical science, and other standard classroom taught                  sciences from a fresh perspective of their possible bearing on                  the existence of life elsewhere.  They will also integrate the                  sciences with some non-scientific subjects, such as art, history,               and social sciences, in a natural manner specified by the                       SETI/LIFE-IN-THE-UNIVERSE connection.  The activities will                      emphasize hands-on learning and how learning is acquired, as well               as subject matter, in a way that develops both communication                    skills and critical thinking.  We expect that the great interest                to young students in SETI, with the natural integration of                      subjects that it mandates, will upgrade students skills in the                  sciences and sustain their interest in seeking careers in                       science.",
