 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to measure metabolic activity, as well as the                  ability to discriminate among different tissue types, make SPECT                a potentially medical imaging tool.  However, the low resolution                and poor image quality that characterize SPECT images limit the                 clinical usefulness of SPECT.  Mathematical Technologies Inc.                   believes that mathematical methods are available which will                     significantly improve SPECT reconstruction techniques.  The                     principle investigator has developed an iterative reconstruction                technique based on Markov random field image models in a Bayesian               framework.  Experiments with this technique indicate that                       dramatic improvements in SPECT image quality may be possible.                   The proposed research would address the issues relevant to the                  clinical viability of the approach: 1.  the imaging                             characteristics of a state of the art machine are to be modeled;                2.  Bayesian reconstructions are to be systematically compared                  to the best available reconstruction techniques; 3.  the                        feasibility of optimizing and/or modifying the computational                    algorithms to produce the reconstruction within clinical time                   limits will be explored; 4.  the possibility of exploiting this                 framework to obtain simultaneous estimates of attenuation and                   isotope concentration will be explored.  (Current methods must                  assume a priori the attenuation structure).  If successful, this                fourth research objective would result in a significant advance                 in the SPECT technology.",
