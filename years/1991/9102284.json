The program's awards provide opportunities                         for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary                      facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                       This award, sponsored by Dr. Richard B. Kaner of the                            University of California, Los Angeles, will support a                           twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Philippe                        Bonneau with Dr. Jean Rouxel of the Institut de Physique                        et Chimie des Mat\u001ariaux, Centre Nationale de la Recherche                       Scientifique, Universit\u001a de Nantes.  They will investigate                      layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and other                       lamellar materials, which can be exfoliated or sonicated                        in polar solvents to produce solution-suspended monolayers.                     The suspended monolayers are then size separated (by gel                        electrophoresis) and used in quantum confinement studies                        or restacked with other low-dimensional compounds to                            create new, metastable inclusion compounds.  Quantum                            confinement in TMD monolayers can be investigated both as                       a function of particle size and as a function of monolayer                      interactions with various chemical environments.  New                           inclusion compounds, composed uniquely of low-dimensional                       materials, provide almost limitless opportunities to                            study topics such as intercalation and electronic                               interactions in mixed low-dimensional materials,                                superconductivity, charge density waves, and the role of                        stoichiometry on the structure and the electronic                               properties in low-dimensional inclusion compounds.                                                                                                              The award recommendation provides funds to cover                                international travel and a flat administrative allowance                        of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
