 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  In a joint project, Dr. Victor Zakkay of New                      York University (NYU), and Drs. V. Krishna Sastri and A.K.                      Kolar of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IITM)                      plan to extend their studies on Pressurized Fluid Bed                           Combustion (PFBC).  The studies will focus on the                               fundamental areas of concern to PFBC including: parametric                      studies on vertical heat exchangers; bubble dynamics with                       immersed horizontal and vertical heat exchangers; and                           combustion and emission characteristics of high moisture                        lignite, high ash coal and high sulpher coal.  Tests will                       be conducted at a recently completed facility for PFBC at                       the IITM which has a combustor of 30 cm diameter, and is                        capable of operating up to 15 atmospheric pressure.                                                                                                             Scope:  This project extends for two years the support                          provided earlier by NSF to the U.S. and Indian scientists                       for studies aimed at understanding the parameters affecting                     the behavior of PFBC and the usefulness of this method of                       coal combustion.  The facility at IITM and the Indian staff                     provide excellent opportunity for extending and broadening                      the investigations being conducted in the U.S. and other                        countries in this field.  The importance of PFBC is well                        recognized in both countries as well as by other countries                      with low quality coal.  The project has the backing of the                      Government of India as well as major coal users in that                         country.                                                                        Funding:  The project is funded under two grants:                               INT 9106224 to the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.                      INT 9012682 to New York University.",
