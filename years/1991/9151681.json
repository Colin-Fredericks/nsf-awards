 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is transforming the introductory mechanics                         laboratory so that freshmen students gain experience with                       realistic electronic instrumentation while learning the                         fundamentals of mechanics.  The project is part of an extensive                 curriculum development accompanying a change from a quarter                     calendar to a semester one. New experiments are adding dynamic                  force transducers, sonar rangers, digital readout strobe                        lighting, oscilloscopes, and digital readout function                           generators to the air tracks, light gates, air-bearing                          rotational apparatus, and PC computers previously used. The new                 experiments include non-linear systems, small oscillations,                     static and dynamic unbalance in rotating objects, and rotation                  of rigid bodies about a point. Such new topics as soft modes,                   spontaneous symmetry breaking, and chaos are being included.                    Folded in are an introduction to electronic instrumentation                     including use of oscilloscopes, and study of wave forms,                        triggering, signal conditioning, and the integration of                         computers into the measurement system. The new lab presents a                   richer variety of important mechanical phenomena, is more                       interesting, and better prepares the students for employment in                 a modern industrial or research setting.NSF grant funds are                     being matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
