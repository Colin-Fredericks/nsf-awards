 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a student in                 cultural anthropology.  The project is to examine the social                    conditions under which evangelical Protestantism and                            \"progressive\" Catholicism have flourished to challenge the long-                dominant folk Catholicism in a proletarianizing peasant village                 in Mexico.  The project will assemble longitudinal data on socio-               economic class, organizational resources, doctrines, political                  practices and beliefs of members of the three religious groups.                 Methods include survey, genealogical interviewing, detailed life                histories, interviews with government and religious leaders,                    archival research and participant observation.  The main question               to be dealt with is the relation of religious affiliation to                    changes in socio-economic class position.                                                                                                                       This research is important because religious change is a striking               fact of life in Latin America, and increased understanding of the               conditions and consequences of this change will help us deal with               the changing sectors of these societies.",
