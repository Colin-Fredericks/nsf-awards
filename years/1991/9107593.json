 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                  will help the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State                         University acquire an upgrade of their computing facilities and                 the x-ray diffraction laboratory.  Among the areas of chemical                  research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the                       following: 1) New Models for the Active Site of Cytochrome c                    Oxidase, 2) Total Synthesis of Natural Products and Development                 of Synthetic Methodology, 3) Asymmetric Bond-Forming Reactions,                 4) The Synthesis and Study of Biomedically Important                            Compounds,and 5) The Synthesis and Characterization of Reactive                 Metal Complexes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful                       analytical method for structure determination of solids.  In                    synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                   chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable                    tool to characterize molecular structure.  The information                      gained from the knowledge of the molecular composition and                      structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general                 interest in catalysis or synthesis.",
