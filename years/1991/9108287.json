 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interactive computer program, CAMEO, is being developed to                   predict the products of organic reactions given the starting                    materials and conditions.  The program uses mechanistic                         principles and precedent-based rules for broad classes of                       reactions to make its predictions.  Consequently, an important                  aspect of the project is the search for organizing principles                   that govern organic reactivity in addition to the development                   of a resource to aid in the analysis and design of synthetic                    pathways.  The program's current capabilities are significant                   with sophisticated treatment of several important classes of                    reactions including base catalyzed and nucleophilic processes,                  thermal pericyclic chemistry, acid catalyzed and electrophilic                  reactions, free radical chain reactions, and functional group                   oxidations.  The intentions are to expand and refine the                        program in many ways.  The most important additions will be for                 transition metal organometallic chemistry, photochemistry,                      catalytic hydrogenations, dissolving metal reductions, and                      three-dimensional structure generation and utilization.                         Broader distribution of the program is also planned through a                   version for the Apple Macintosh II computer.                                                                                                                    The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is supporting the                       continuation of the development of this computer based program                  CAMEO to predict reactivities of synthetic reagents and their                   reaction products.  This has the potential to greatly improve                   the efficiency of the synthetic procedures used to meet the                     increasingly complex requirements of our economy.",
