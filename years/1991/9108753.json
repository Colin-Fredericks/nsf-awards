 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to make a large group of machine              learning algorithms more useful in practice.  This research focuses on          formal models of machine learning, an area known as computational               learning theory.  The overall goal of this field is to give formal,             mathematical definitions of learning problems, and to provide                   efficient algorithms to solve these problems.                                   The computational learning theory community has proposed a large                number of algorithms for solving low-level induction problems, but              there are certain properties such learning algorithms must have if              they are going to be used in real-world software.  Practitioners, such          as builders of large artificial intelligence systems, have complained           that these algorithms require too much data to reach conclusions, and           are too sensitive to noise in the data.  This project will attempt to           prove that much less data is necessary for average cases than the               estimates given by theorists for the worst case, and to study how such          algorithms can be modified to resist noise.                                     The proposed project consists of the design and analysis of                     algorithms, and is essentially mathematical in nature.  Nevertheless,           if successful, this project should allow the practical application of           recently developed machine learning algorithms.",
