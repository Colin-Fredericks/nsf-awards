 "awd_abstract_narration": "The DNAs encapsidated by parvoviruses show distinctly different                 patterns with respect to the ratio of plus to minus strands and the             preponderance of the flip as opposed to the flop conformation at                the termini.  We have developed a kinetic model for parvoviral DNA              replication, based on differential rates of hairpin transfer at the             3' termini that initiate replication, that accounts for the                     characteristics of the progeny virion DNA of the parvoviruses.  We              propose to test specific predictions of the model, thereby                      validating it or showing where it might need re-adjustment.  The                flip-flop ratio at the left end of the plus strand of Lulll will be             determined to distinguish between the kinetic hairpin transfer                  model and the modified rolling circle model, which requires a                   unique flip conformation at this location.  The polarity and flip-              flop ratios of progeny DNA of dimeric BPV genomes with duplicate or             inverted ends will be investigated and compared with computer                   predictions based on the relative rate constants for hairpin                    transfer associated with each terminus.  Site-directed mutagenesis              will eliminate \"bubbles\" associated with flip and flop                          conformations and the effect of these changes on replication and                progeny DNA characteristics seen.                                                                                                                               Conclusions from the projected work will result from the                        collaborative efforts of a biologist and a mathematician.  Neither              scientist could effectively undertake this project without the                  input of the other scientist.*** //",
