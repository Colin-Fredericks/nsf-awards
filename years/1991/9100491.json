 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experiences for Undergraduates project supported                by this grant will follow a three-stage approach.  The format                   does not follow the traditional summer schedule.  Rather,                       students will first complete two six-week cycles of study and                   research during the academic year.  They will concentrate on                    understanding the structure of crystallographic groups.  The work               will cover the necessary concepts in modern algebra and number                  theory which form the basis of X-ray crystallography.  Matrix                   groups, subgroup structure , normality and quotient structure                   will be analyzed first.  Particular crystallographic groups will                be taken up next and students will learn how to extract relevant                properties from these structures.                                                    The second cycle involves activities related to the study of               crystallographic groups on certain rings.  This will involve the                development of computational techniques for matrix manipulation.                Students will learn the orbital decomposition of rings and the                  concept of fundamental region.  They will, at this stage, be                    introduced to the Center for Large Scale Computation to observe                 research activities on the applications of computation in                       research, design of algorithms and scientific computing.                             The third stage involves independent work and will take                    place immediately after the close of spring semester.  Students                 will use computers to determine fundamental regions and the                     permutation matrices mapping one region onto another.  They will                investigate the efficiency of the permutation relative to                       specific computer architectures.  Time will also be spent                       developing algorithms and implementing theoretical ideas to the                 computational environment, where properties overlooked in the                   theoretical phase become evident.",
