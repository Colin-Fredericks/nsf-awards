 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Minority Research Center of Excellence (MRCE) project at                   Hampton University represents the establishment of an                           internationally competitive nuclear physics program.  This is                   the first program of this quality in nuclear and high energy                    physics to be located at a historically Black university.                       More specifically, this project will:  (a) expand and enhance                   the physics faculty at Hampton; (b) strengthen collaborative                    activities with accelerator facilities that are located at                      other universities and national laboratories; and (c)                           provide support to develop a Ph.D. program in nuclear physics                   at Hampton University.  Hampton University will serve as a                      Center for promoting interest in nuclear and high energy                        physics by underrepresented minorities.  This achievement                       provides a focal point for the University to work with other                    historically Black colleges and universities to strengthen                      nuclear and high energy physics by underrepresented                             minorities.  This achievement provides a focal point for the                    University to work with other historically Black colleges                       and universities to strengthen nuclear and high energy                          physics throughout the nation.                                                                                                                                  The MRCE at Hampton will continue collaborations with the                       Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at                        Hampton Roads and with the College of William and Mary.  The                    CEBAF facility will provide a better understanding of the                       basic nature of matter.  CEBAF's advances will continue the                     tradition of nuclear physics to benefit other fields such as                    molecular biology, materials science, geological prospecting,                   semiconductor fabrication, radiation medicine, and energy                       technology.  Hampton University plans to fulfill a dream in                     being an integral part of CEBAF's overall development and to                    make that dream a reality for minorities who choose careers                     in science and engineering.  The nuclear and high energy                        physics faculty members at Hampton are will respected in the                    scientific community because of their publications in                           refereed journals and their participation in national and                       international professional conferences.",
