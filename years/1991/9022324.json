 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will address some key technical problems that will need           to be resolved before proceeding with full-scale commercial                     development of a comprehensive and flexible set of Ada program                  quality-enhancing tools, the Ada Quality Toolset (AQT).  These tools            will support Ada program developers by checking, and where                      appropriate, enforcing, a set of Ada programming style guidelines.                                                                                              A Phase I research project has demonstrated the feasibility of                  supporting a wide range of guidelines, and has defined usage modes,             user interfaces and outline architecture for a toolset.  The Phase II           research will focus on three main areas:                                                                                                                              o   Design of toolset components and processing functions, with                     exploratory prototyping to resolve difficult technical                          issues where appropriate and necessary.                                                                                                                     o   Prototype implementation of a toolset with sufficient                           fuctionality to demonstrate that a full commercial toolset                      can be implemented, and to allow evaluation of usability and                    utility.                                                                                                                                                    o   Experimental evaluation of the usability and utility of the                     prototype toolset.                                                                                                                                    Design and implemenation of a prototype toolset will require the                solution to a number of technical problems.  If these problems can be           solved, and the prototype toolset proves to be both usable and useful,          the feasibility and desirability of proceeding with full scale                  commerical development of AQT will be fully demonstrated.",
