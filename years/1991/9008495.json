 "awd_abstract_narration": "Often in real chemical reactors, a large number of distinct                     species interact through an intricate network of chemical                       reactions.  Such complex systems can behave in unexpected                       ways, causing multiple steady states, instabilities, runaway                    reactions, explosions, etc.  The goal of this research is the                   creation of theory that provides practicing engineers and                       chemists with readily applicable analytical tools to be used                    for:  (1) the operation of reactors with complex but well                       understood chemistry (the theory would provide an indication                    of the stability problems that should be a source of concern),                  and (2) the study of reactors with poorly understood chemistry                  (the theory would provide means for the sensitive                               discrimination between rival mechanisms put forward to account                  for laboratory observations).  The PI's chemical reaction                       theory is rooted in the idea that, however vast the territory                   of chemical reaction engineering might seem, the systems of                     differential equations that present themselves for study have                   a very special structure.  At least when the kinetics is mass                   action, each system is determined (up to rate constant values)                  in a very precise way from the underlying network of chemical                   reactions, and so it becomes meaningful to ask questions about                  the relationship between reaction network structure and                         qualitative properties of the corresponding differential                        equations.                                                                                                                                                      Work under this grant will consist of three new projects: (1)                   unification of the PI's earlier deficiency-oriented theories                    with newer developments based on his Species-Complex-Linkage                    graph (SCL Graph) and application to more complex systems such                  as electrochemical reactions; (2) application of existing and                   newly developed theory to heterogeneous catalysis with special                  emphasis on the way in which the operative catalytic pathway                    reveals itself in multiple steady state data by way of a                        characteristic \"mechanistic signature\"; and (3) development of                  user-oriented personal computer software which would not                        require knowledge of the underlying complex mathematical                        analysis.",
