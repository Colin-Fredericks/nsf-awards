 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is a twelve month effort to examine the                         implications of school-based management (SMB) on science and math               education.  The final report is intended for use by school system               personnel throughout the country and other educators.  It will                  provide findings and recommendations for systems considering, or in             the process of implementing, some form of SBM.                                       The study will examine approximately 18 school systems, ones               that have had at least one year of experience with SBM.  (Six will              be examine on-site and twelve by extensive telephone interviewing.)             The study will focus on grades 7-12 to separate out SBM's science               and math implications from that of other subjects.  It will use in-             person interviews, focus groups, semi-structured questionnaires,                and an examination of documentation from these schools.  Using                  qualitative evaluation procedures, the study will analyze such                  elements as:  Extent of actual implementation, effects on science               and math educational practices, problems found, actions to                      alleviate problems and extent of alleviation, factors associated                with successful implementation of SBM, and initial perceptions of               effects on student learning and interest in science and math.",
