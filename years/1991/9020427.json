 "awd_abstract_narration": "How are introns spliced from tRNA molecules in the yeast                        Saccharomyces cerevisiae?  tRNA splicing is essential in yeast.                 Study of tRNA splicing in yeast is a paradigm for splicing in a                 wide variety of organisms since the mechanism of splicing is                    highly conserved in these organisms.  Splicing involves excision                of the intron by an endonuclease, ligation of the resultant half-               molecules by a ligase, and removal of a 2'-phosphate left at the                splice junction.  Since this phosphate is one base 3' of the tRNA               anticodon its removal is likely necessary to generate functional                tRNA.                                                                                                                                                           Removal of this 2'-phosphate is the subject of this proposal.                   The PI has recently identified and partially purified a protein                 from yeast that can efficiently remove the splice junction                      phosphate from ligated tRNA.  This protein is unique: it is                     specific for 2'-phosphorylated substrates, requires NAD+ and acts               as a phosphotransferase.  Its activity also appears to be                       affected by cells carrying a tpd1 mutation. He proposes to                      determine how NAD+ is used in dephosphorylation of ligated tRNA                 and to identify the proteins involved in this reaction.  He also                proposes to determine how TPD1 protein affects dephosphorylation                of ligated tRNA in the cell, and to study the interaction of the                2'-phosphotransferase with other components of the tRNA splicing                machinery.",
