 "awd_abstract_narration": "Allegheny College seeks funding for a three-year                           program:  Project A-Step:  Reformulating Teacher                                Preparation in Mathematics and Science.  The project,                           developed with a planning grant from NSF and the Exxon                          Foundation, will redesign the teacher preparation programs                      in mathematics and science at Allegheny and will make                           discipline-specific preservice education a central focus of                     the entire college.  The department of education has                            already been restructured,  and all positions are or will                       be filled by faculty with dual appointments in mathematics                      or science departments.  There is a structure in place, The                     Schools Partnership, which ties the college to six school                       districts.  The Partnership will be involved in project                         activities with faculty and students through joint                              programs, institutes, workshops, student mentoring, student                     field-experiences, and program development in Project                           A-Step.  A component of the Partnership is an electronic                        computer network which will provide teachers, students,                         faculty members access to each other and to the college's                       computer as well as to the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center.                     The Allegheny faculty has formed a Task Force on teaching                       to develop programs in mathematics and science education                        for preservice teachers which have as the basic premise a                       strong command of the discipline, knowledge of the                              connections to related disciplines, and discipline specific                     pedagogy.  The faculty and top administration are committed                     to make Allegheny a model for small liberal colleges that                       prepare teachers in mathematics and science.                                                                                                                         Allegheny has received funding for related components                      of the project from the Amoco Foundation, the Vira Heinz                        Endowment, the Pew Charitable Trusts; and the Knight                            Foundation.  In addition, Allegheny's cost share will be                        62% of the NSF total costs.",
