 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are widespread examples of animals in nature that suppress                metabolism and enter dormant states in response to suboptimal                   environmental conditions.  Such a metabolic response would seem to              require coordinated suppression of both energy-producing pathways               and biosynthetic, energy-utilizing processes.  One objective of the             proposed studies is to identify the mechanisms responsible for the              simultaneous, yet independent, arrest of protein biosynthesis and               of catabolic pathways during anaerobic dormancy in embryos of the               brine shrimp Artemia.  Regulation of protein synthesis will be                  examined in the cytoplasmic as well as the intramitochondrial                   compartments.  The same intracellular signal (acidic intracellular              pH) may directly or indirectly mediate arrest of anabolic and                   catabolic pathways, and that rates of macromolecular degradation                may ultimately limit the duration of dormancy.  Secondly, the                   importance of intracellular solutes in disrupting metabolic                     organization during cellular dehydration will be studied.  Thirdly,             studies will be directed toward understanding the nature of                     developmental and metabolic arrest during diapause in Artemia                   embryos.  Methods employed in these studies will include                        simultaneous microcalorimetry-respirometry, a cell free translation             system for quantifying protein synthesis, permeabilization of                   embryos, and in vitro studies with isolated organelles.  Results                of these studies should have implication for a variety of                       biological systems that experience stress as a result of                        desiccation, oxygen deprivation an temperature extremes, or in                  general, for any tissue or cell where acute modulation of                       biosynthesis and energy metabolism is known to occur. //",
