To test the validity of this                                                                                                approach, they will apply it to a river food web at a site                      within an old-growth conifer forest in northern California.  At                 present, this site is relatively pristine, but invasion by exotic                                                                                               predators and herbivores (squawfish and bullfrogs) is anticipated                                                                                               within a few years.  In the pre-invasion community, the                         researchers will investigate how macroalgae, which dominate                     primary producer assemblages in the river, mediate predator-prey                                                                                                interactions involving the dominant vertebrate and invertebrate                 grazers.
