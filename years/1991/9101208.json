 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research project in computational logic.  The areas of                research stem directly from the analysis of the structure of formulas           in negation toward several research topics.  Substantial experimental           results at the propositional level, preliminary experimental results            at the first order level, and certain theoretical results indicate              that the most important of these may be path dissolution, a rule of             inference that is strongly complete at the ground level.  Exploration           of this and related inference mechanisms will be continued, largely             through experimentation.                                                                                                                                        One major thrust of the investigation will be to further the                    implementation of the path resolution and semantic graph techniques             developed earlier.  A sophisticated ground system and a first order             system are now operational; the latter is a solid platform on which             techniques proposed below will be tested:  link selection; computing            prime implicants; backtracking; theory links and dissolution; and               star chains.                                                                                                                                                    While abstract proof-theoretic questions are of interest in their own           right, the development of performance enhancements for the theorem              proving system is also a major motivation.  A number of such                    enhancements will be investigated.  Among them are: improved                    efficiency of existing inference mechanisms; improved proof search              with existing mechanisms; and development of new inference techniques           that alter the search space itself.                                                                                                                             Specifically, system development will be enhanced through                       investigation of: dissolution, analytic tableaux, and the                       distributive law; dissolution versus resolution; quantifier                     duplication, proof length, and cycles; algorithms for computing prime           implicants; and induction and equality.",
