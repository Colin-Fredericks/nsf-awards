 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on the role(s) of DNA methylation in the                  regulation of pyelonephritis-associated pili (pap) gene                         expression. Pap pili expression is subject to a phase variation                 regulatory mechanism which involves DNA methylation and specific                methylation blocking at two GATC sites within the pap regulatory                region.  This mechanism appears to be distinct from other phase                 variation systems previously studied.  The overall objective of                 this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which the                        methylation of two \"GATC\" DNA sequences within pap is blocked by                the papI and methylation blocking factor (mbf) gene products and                how these two genes products regulate pap pilin transcription.                  To accomplish this overall objective I propose to first modify                  DNA sequences both nearby and within the GATC deoxyadenosine                    methylase recognition sequences which are located adjacent to the               pilin promoter.  The effects of these mutations on pilin                        transcription will be determined using both pap-lac gene fusion                 constructs and quantitative analysis of pap mRNA.  A second                     objective will be a combined genetic and biochemical approach to                overexpress and purify the PapI and MBF protein (s) which are                   required for pap transcription as well as GATC methylation                      blocking.  Both in vitro and in vivo protein-DNA interaction                    analyses will be carried out to determine how MBF and PapI                      interact with pap DNA sequences to                                              block methylation and facilitate pap pilin transcription.  The                  role(s) of Dam methylase in this process will be examined by                    determining the effect(s) of in vitro methylation on protein-DNA                interactions. The experiments proposed are important and                        significant because they explore a new area in bacterial gene                   regulation; the epigenetic modulation of gene expression by DNA                 methylation.",
