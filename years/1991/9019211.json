 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a request for supplemental support for                  salary and expendables to permit participation in EUMELI 2,                     France's component of JGOFS.  The project will be carried out in                conjunction with French marine scientists who will be conducting                multidisciplinary studies aboard the new IFREMER research vessel,               ATLANTE, at a series of stations off NW Africa.  The PI has been                invited to participate in one leg of a 3-leg expedition presently               scheduled for February 1991.  IFREMER will provide G. Rowe and G.               Boland with travel and shipping funds, and will make ship time                  available. The project will provide a benthic lander to measure                 total community respiration and dissolved inorganic nutrient                    regeneration, a newly described box core to take undisturbed                    bottom samples, and an array of near-bottom sediment traps.                     The GOMEX box corer  will allow quantification of the biomass of                the three principal size groups in the sediments - the bacteria,                meiofauna and macrofauna.  Direct comparisons will be made                      between this new device and the USNEL spade core to be used by                  IFREMER on the expedition.  This also provides an opportunity to                compare the Texas A&M lander with the lander used by Dr. Richard                Jahnke, a geochemist, another U.S. invited participant.                         Short-term sediment trap samples form deep, near-bottom moored                  traps will be used to provide fresh, unadulterated samples to                   chemists and microbiologists, and for comparison with long-term                 and short-term flux measures to be conducted by IFREMER at their                designated sites.",
