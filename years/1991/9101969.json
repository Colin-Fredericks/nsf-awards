 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will work in collaboration with                 both experimental and theoretical biologists in the area of cell                surface receptors.  Biological cells sense their environment                    primarily through the interaction of cell surface receptors with                specific extracellular ligands.  These molecular interactions                   serve as signals, initiating cell responses to hormones,                        neurotransmitters, immune response mediators and other molecules.               The planned work is the mathematical component of                               theoretical/experimental collaborations aimed at identifying                    particular cell signals and response pathways.  These models are                essential for the understanding of the biology, because the                     mechanisms cannot be observed directly.  The mathematical tools                 will involve the analysis of spatial data.
