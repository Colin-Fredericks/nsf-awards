 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objectives of this proposal are to determine at the               cellular and molecular level how blue light is perceived by plants              and transduced into growth responses.  This project will                        investigate the physiological and genetic basis for blue light                  responses in higher plants using Arabidopsis as a model system.                 The response we will concentrate on is the inhibition of hypocotyl              elongation caused by continuous blue light.  Specific goals are to              isolate a number of mutant strains that show altered responses to               blue light and to use these mutants to characterize portions of                 the signal transduction pathway, perhaps the blue light receptor                itself.  Physiological analysis of the mutant plants will be                    conducted in order to identify what phases of the response are                  affected by the mutations.  Interactions between various blue and               red light responses share signal transduction events.  Plants                   containing two or more light-response mutations will be genetically             constructed and used in the investigation of the light-dependent                signal transduction networks.  The blue light-response mutants will             be genetically characterized using complementation analysis to                  determine the minimum number of steps involved in signal                        transduction.  Finally the mutations will be mapped to their                    chromosome locations followed by gene isolation, using T-DNA                    insertion mutants or by chromosome walking, in order to identify                the proteins required for blue light signal transduction.                                                                                                       Light not only supplies plants with the energy for photosynthesis,              but also regulates nearly all stages of plant development,                      independent of photosynthesis.  For a seedling to properly                      establish itself requires the coordinated action of numerous                    developmental pathways.  Light, through the action of several                   photoreceptor systems, triggers many of the developmental changes               essential for seedlings to make the transition from growing in the              darkness of the soil to the light of the sun.  The red/far red                  light receptor, phytochrome, has been the most intensively studied,             whereas the nature of the blue and ultraviolet receptors is                     virtually unknown.  This proposal seeks to identify and investigate             the mechanisms by which plants perceive and respond to blue light               and, thus, how plants adapt to different light conditions.  The                 investigation of blue light response systems is likely to lead to               important new insights into the physiological and molecular                     mechanisms controlling photomorphogenesis during seedling                       establishment.***//",
