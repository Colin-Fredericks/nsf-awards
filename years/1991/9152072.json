A microcomputer-                  based laboratory consisting of student workstations networked                   with a server are incorporated into the introductory core                       curriculum courses (Diversity, Ecology/Evolutionary Biology,                    Genetics, and Molecular/Cellular/Developmental Biology), a                      research methods course, upper division elective courses, and                   non-major's courses to enhance the teaching of major biological                 concepts and scientific problem-solving skills.  Interactive                    object-oriented software (utilizing a Macintosh interface)                      serve as the platform to address learning of concepts through                   a) computer databases, b) simulations, c) computer-based data                   collection exercises, and d) data analysis exercises of                         laboratory or field-collected data.  Problem-solving skills are                 addressed with hypermedial tools that provide a) database                       support, b) graphical support, c) statistical support, and d)                   productivity support.",
