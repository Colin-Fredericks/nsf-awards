 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past number of years there has been considerable work in               law and economics on optimal law enforcement.  Overall this                     research has emphasized theoretical modelling focusing on the                   effects of penalties on criminal behavior, the effects of plea                  bargaining on convictions, and the effects of expenditures by                   defendants to avoid prosecution and conviction.  While the models               that have developed have made important contributions, they all                 have emphasized that, at least over some range of crimes, uniformly             maximal penalties are most efficient.                                                                                                                           Dr. Andreoni questions this assumption and takes the view that much             more can be learned about penalties if more explicit account were               taken of the process by which society determines that an accused                person deserves to be punished.  He focuses explicitly on the role              of reasonable doubt since this standard (i.e., whether evidence is              convincing \"beyond a reasonable doubt\") influences judges, juries,              and prosecutors engaged in plea bargaining.  The work is especially             noteworthy in combining theoretical modelling, field study, and                 experimental research.  His empirical efforts will range from a                 reanalysis of the Ehrlich data on the deterrent effects of                      punishment taking into consideration reasonable doubt to role                   playing studies of criminal behavior and experimental jury                      simulations under varying penalty conditions.                                                                                                                   The potenial yield from this research is considerable.  Since                   standard models of optimal penalty do not take reasonable doubt                 into account, by taking this step (under the straightforward model              of reasonable doubt and under a model that also considers                       institutional features of the legal system), this work offers a                 welcome new approach to modelling crime and punishment.  Such work              is of pathbreaking importance because it promises to bring theory               and reality much closer together.",
