 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant molecular biology is currently limited by supporting genetic              technology, particularly in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana.             This project aims to explore the feasibility of using two site-                 specific DNA enzyme systems from the yeast Saccharomyces                        cerevisiase to develop genetic methods in Arabidopsis based on                  site-specific recombination.  The two systems are the FLP                       recombinase, derived from the yeast 2-micron plasmid, and the HO                recombinase, which promotes yeast mating type switching.  FLP                   promotes reciprocal recombination between two asymmetric FRT target             sites, resulting in deletion or inversion of the intervening DNA                depending on whether the two sites are in direct or inverted                    respectively; HO promotes gap repair by homologous recombination                after cutting at its Y/Z target.  Demonstration of either or both               activities will allow the subsequent design of sophisticated                    schemes for targeted genetic events in plants.                                                                                                                  The goals for the present period are to demonstrate FLP and/or HO               activity in plant systems.  Available cloned genes encoding each                enzyme will be placed downstream of the available strong                        constitutive CaMV 35S promoter, and activity of the transcribed and             translated enzymes will be assayed.  For FLP, assays will score                 deletion or inversion of a reporter GUS (escherichia coli B-                    glucuronidase) gene located between pair of direct or inverted FRT              sites; for HO, assays will score recombination between two copies               of GUS reporter gene promoted by gap repair of a Y/Z site in one                of them.  Assays will be carried out in both transient                          (electroporated tobacco and Arabidopsis protoplasts) and stable                 (transgenic Arabidopsis plants) configurations.                                  *** //",
