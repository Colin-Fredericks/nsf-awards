 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three week Oceanography Short Course for Instructors of                    Undergraduate Marine Sciences is offered by the University of San               Diego and Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College. It updates                      instructors from 2- and 4-year institutions in the technologically              impacted ocean sciences.  Course objectives are to provide state-               of-the-art information in marine research and applications; hands-              on experiences in oceanographic sample collecting and data                      analysis; and new instructional materials and techniques.                                                                                                       The forty participants earn three graduate semester units in Marine             Studies by participating in a variety of activities at the                      University, and at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UCSD),                  Grossmont Community College, the coastal nuclear power station at               San Onofre, commercial aquiculture facilities, and Sea World/Hubbs              Research Institute.  Field excursions include data and sample                   collecting aboard the 125' R/V Gordon Sproul, site visits to                    classic exposures of sedimentary marine facies, and a voyage past               the Los Coronados Islands to Ensenada, Mexico, to the University                Autonomia de Baja California Marine Studies facilities.                                                                                                         The program presents a broad spectrum of ocean-related information              for undergraduate classrooms:  cutting edge scientific information,             instructional materials and software, and data on current marine                studies programs and employment possibilities.",
