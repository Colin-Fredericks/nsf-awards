 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mapping class groups and moduli spaces can be approached from              several very different directions:  through geometric geometry, 3-              dimensional topology and hyperbolic geometry; through algebraic                 geometry (specifically the theory of algebraic curves); and through             mathematical physics via conformal field theory.  There are also                interesting connections with arithmetic groups and representation               theory.  There is often little communication between the various                groups working in this area, and the techniques and proofs of one               group are often not well understood by those in another.                             This grant will partially support a conference whose aim is to             assemble experts in these fields, together with graduate students               and young mathematicians from the various fields, so that the                   participants can deepen their understanding of this area.  This                 should result in a good deal of cross-fertilization and progress in             algebraic geometry.  The conference will be held in August, 1991,               at the University of Washington.",
