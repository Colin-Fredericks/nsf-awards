 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Stalcup will prepare and characterize regiospecifically                     derivatized B-cyclodextrins to serve as models for the                          derivatized cyclodextrins immobilized as chiral selectors in                    normal phase high performance liquid chromatography.  She will                  use NMR and circular dichroism to probe substitution patterns                   on the cyclodextrin as well as to investigate the possibility                   of chiral discrimination in the derivatization of the                           cyclodextrin with a chiral derivatizing agent.  In addition,                    NMR will be used to study the association complexes formed                      between the derivatized cyclodextrin and chiral analytes.                       In related work, Dr. Stalcup will explore alternative applica-                  tions of derivatized beta-cyclodextrins to chiral separations                   including their use as chiral mobile phase additives and as                     enantioselective precipitation agents.  Derivatized alpha- and                  gamma-cyclodextrin bonded phases analogous to previously                        reported derivatized beta-cyclodextrin phases will be prepared,                 evaluated chromatographically and compared with the derivatized                 beta-cyclodextrin phases.                                                       %%%                                                                             Research Planning Grants enable women who have not had prior                    independent Federal research support to develop a competitive                   research project.  This project involves the preparation and                    characterization of new materials for use in the separation, by                 high performance liquid chromatography, of molecules which                      consist of the same atoms linked in the same way, but which                     differ in their three-dimensional structures.  This research is                 of great importance to the chemical industry.",
