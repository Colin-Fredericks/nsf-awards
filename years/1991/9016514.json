To do this,                          the researchers will examine the propagation, reflection                        and trapping of Alfven waves in atmospheres of late-type                        giants and supergiants (stars).  Findings will be used                          to construct models of cool massive stellar winds which                         account for observed wind energetics and radiation                              losses.  Results are expected to provide an explanation                         of stellar mass loss and contribute to our basic                                understanding of the complex physics occurring in the                           atmospheres of such stars.                                                                                                                                      This project on stars and stellar evolution fulfills the                        program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                          enabling leading researchers in the United States and                           Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities                        in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the                        field of basic scientific research on the basis of                              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
