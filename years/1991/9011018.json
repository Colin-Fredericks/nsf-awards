Barbareno Chumash is probably among                  the best documented but least known languages of North America.                 The enormous quantity of manuscript material that exists, most of               it unorganized and much of it untranslated, has until now daunted               scholars working alone.                                                                                                                                              A group will organize the material and enter it into a                     computer in a form that can be sorted by a concordance program.                 It will then be possible to extract all instances of any morpheme               in the corpus, in context, with literal and free translations.                  Each participant will research specific areas of the language and               present results to the rest of the group for discussion and                     revision.  During the final year of the project, the studies will               be worked into a comprehensive grammar.                                                                                                                              Because of the elaborate verb morphology of the language,                  which has major ramifications for syntactic and discourse                       structure, a detailed, richly exemplified grammar should be of                  special importance to linguistic theory.  Because of the much                   debated assignment of Chumash to the hypothesized Hokan stock of                languages, accessibility of this data will be an important tool                 for work on deeper genetic relationships among North America                    languages.  The grammar should also provide a long-awaited                      resource to ethnologists, ethnobiologists, ethnohistorians,                     historians, and others interested in the Chumash.",
