 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a visit by Dr. Abraham Clearfield of                        Texas A&M University to CSIRO, Melbourne, Australia,                            to work with Dr. Terry Turney.  The researchers propose to                      combine the expertise in materials synthesis of the two                         institutions to synthesize novel inorganic nanocomposite                        materials with two related synthetic procedures.  In the                        first, clays and other layered compounds are pillared by a                      variety of polycations and thermally treated to decompose the                   pillar into a layer of oxide sandwiched between the host                        layers.  Compounds to be pillared include clays, tetravalent                    phosphates, layered hydrous oxides, layered titanates,                          silicic acids, layered spinels of the type K and layered                        double hydroxides.  The latter class of compounds is pillared                   by polyanions.  These pillared compounds will then be treated                   thermally to decompose the pillar into sheets of oxide                          sandwiched between layers of the host, thus creating ceramic                    nanocomposites.  In the second synthetic procedure, two or                      more layered compounds will be exfoliated into their individual                 layers, mixed and reconstituted into a single phase.  The                       exfoliates will be prepared by either attaching pendent                         hydrophilic organic groups to the layers or intercalating a                     polyether amine between the layers.  A wide variety of di-,                     tri- and tetravalent metal compounds may be manipulated in                      this fashion.  Reconstitution of the exfoliates will be                         effected by thermal removal of the organic, by acid treatment                   to remove intercalated amines, or by gentle alkaline hydrolysis                 of the phosphonates.  The final annealed solids will be                         interlayered phosphates, hydroxides or oxides, and will                         constitute new types of such solids with novel catalytic,                       magnetic and electrical properties.",
