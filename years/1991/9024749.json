 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative research effort by institutions in the U.S.,                    France, and Madagascar will result in a modern conspectus for the               flora of Madagascar.  Current information on the flora of                       Madagascar is incomplete and/or dispersed, and inadequate for                   addressing critical conservation needs.  Utilizing the TROPICOS                 database system developed at the Missouri Botanical Garden,                     investigators will compile a checklist of all the vascular plants               indigenous to and naturalized in Madagascar.  The computer database             will include place of publication, accepted synonymy, typification,             overall distribution and distribution within Madagascar by province             and protected area, habit, and vernacular names, all vouchered by               specimens tied, to as great a degree as possible, to latitude and               longitude, and hence, directly available to a GIS-based                         biodiversity inventory and planning center in Madagascar.  Capture              of data for the conspectus will involve: 1) extraction from all                 known literature at each of the collaborating institutions; 2)                  verification of type material, principally located at the Museum                National d'Historie Naturelle (P) in Paris, and secondarily so at               Kew (K) and the British Museum (BM) in London; 3) exhaustive                    inventory and computerization (and therefore annotation) of the                 existing collections in Madagascar at the Parc de Tsimbazaza (TAN)              and FO.FI.FA. (TEF) herbaria in Antananarivo, as well as those at               the Missouri Botanical Garden (MO), which, along with type                      material, will form the basis of vouchered distributional                       occurrence.  Data from each of the collaborating institutions will              be collated at MO, where investigators from the Malagasy                        institutions will receive training in botanical data collection and             management, and its direct application to pressing conservation                 imperatives.  A complete checklist of the vascular flora of                     Madagascar will serve to stimulate and facilitate further taxonomic             work, while immediately providing critical data on the current                  conservation status of one of the world's richest, most unique, and             highly threatened floras.",
