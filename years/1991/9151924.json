 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southern College of Technology is adding an Automated Lightwave                 Component Analysis System at its campus in Marietta, GA.  This                  new instrumentation system represents a major addition to the                   Wilder Communications Center. The Automated Lightwave Component                 Analysis System gives the 1100 undergraduate students in the                    Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology department                       access to the latest in computer-controlled test                                instrumentation that is equivalent to that used in the                          lightwave communications industry. Southern Tech's students use                 the system to study, in great detail, the performance of                        virtually any transmitter or receiver used in modern fiberoptic                 voice, data and video communications systems throughout the                     world. Their studies include analysis of high-speed and high-                   power semiconductor lasers and of very sensitive photodiodes.                   In addition, the lightwave analysis instrumentation allows the                  students to completely characterize the end-to-end performance                  of entire fiberoptic systems including those designed and built                 as projects by the students themselves.",
