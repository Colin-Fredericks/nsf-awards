 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a series of mathematics software                      programs for middle school students.  These programs are to                     develop skills in mathematics problem solving.  It has a specific               target: at-risk students in the middle school.  The goal is to                  develop a discovery based approach to enable students to explore                the types of information necessary to discover key procedures.                  Two types of software will be developed.  the first type is a                   toolkit which enable students to construct experiments on the                   relationships among different ways of expressing numbers.  the                  second type is word problem processors, which allow students to                 generate varieties of word problems and speculate about                         similarities of the conditions under which the computer used a                  particular approach to solving a given problem.                                                                                                                 In addition, lesson plans will be developed and published.  These               lessons are to guide the teachers in the use of the software.                   The lessons will be geared to existing software as well as the                  software being developed on the project.  The result will be a                  complete course of lessons.",
