The workshop, organized by Professor Eugene                       Stanley of Boston University and Professor Leo Moseley of the                   University of the West Indies in Barbados, together with                        Professor Miguel Octavio of the Instituto Venezolano de                         Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC) in Venezuela, will bring                     together scientists from the Caribbean, Latin America and                       Europe as well as from the U.S.                                                                                                                                 Random materials and processes is a relatively new interdis-                    ciplinary field whose goal is to understand a large class of                    phenomena and structures, which at the microscopic level are                    random and unpredictable but reveal structure and predic-                       tability in the large.  Indeed, a very large part of our                        natural environment as well as a substantial fraction of man-                   made objects, including glasses, polymers and amorphous                         materials are examples of these materials.  Thus the area is                    one of interest to a broad range of scientists and subject to                   various approaches: from the purely mathematical to the level                   of direct engineering applicability.  In keeping with the                       goals of the Science in Developing Countries Program, the                       workshop has been designed to reach engineers, scientists,                      and mathematicians interested in recent progress in this                        multi-disciplinary field.",
