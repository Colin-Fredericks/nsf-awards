 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of five US scientists                 in a joint US-Japan seminar on \"Fundamental Aspects of the                      Physics of the Lightning Discharge\".  Research in this area                     is important particularly because of the adverse effects of                     lightning on the general population.  Much has been learned                     in recent years about lightning discharge, particularly on                      the understanding of the generation mechanism of lightning,                     the discharge process, the control and prediction of lightning                  and protection for lightning hazards.  Scientists at NASA                       have now perfected the technique of triggering lightning                        using small rockets trailing copper wire and the Japanese                       have been experimenting with similar techniques.  Further                       research is still needed and any new understandings will have                   benefits for the whole of society.  Japan and the US are two                    of the leading countries in lightning research and therefore                    a joint seminar in this area would be both scientifically                       productive and timely.                                                                                                                                          The seminar will be held November 17 - 21 in Toyota City,                       Japan. The co-organizers are Professor E Philip Krider,                         Director of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, University                    of Arizona, and Dr. Minoru Nakano, Department of Information                    and Computer Engineering, Toyota College of Technology,                         Toyota, Japan.  Specific topics to be discussed include (1)                     the mechanism of lightning discharge; (2) the similarities                      and differences between natural lightning, Triggered lightning                  and long gap discharges; (3) techniques to trigger lightning                    by rocket; and (4) the development of novel techniques for                      the prediction and protection of lightning.  There has been                     little exchange or collaboration between the US and Japan in                    this area in the past and this seminar should therefore be a                    step towards bridging the gap between the two communities.                      It is probable that some collaborative projects and exchanges                   of scientists will result.",
