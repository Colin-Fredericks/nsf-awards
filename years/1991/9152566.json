This network is also                       connected to a lecture teaching station, instructor stations,                   and an existing local area network. The laboratory stations are                 supplied with hardware and software to support data and                         graphical analysis, analog and image data acquisition, report                   generation, tutorials and a problem/question database. The                      students do experiments designed to teach them competency in                    the use of these tools for analysis and increase their                          understanding of physics concepts. The teaching station                         supports the display of large static images, high resolution                    dynamic images, interactive videodisc and videotape as well as                  conversion of computer images to videotape.",
