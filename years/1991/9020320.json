 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an investigation of several effects on drop                     coalescence in stirred liquid-liquid dispersions which may be                   used effectively to control drop populations.  Thus the effect                  of surface charge on droplets and its manipulation by various                   means on coalescence phenomena is investigated experimentally                   and theoretically.  The manipulation of surface charge effects                  are accomplished by addition of electrolytes and surfactants,                   and by varying the pH of the medium.  The effect of turbulence                  intensity on drop coalescence is investigated as a method to                    control drop sizes by energy input to the dispersion.  Since                    most industrial liquid-liquid contacting operations involve                     high dispersed phase fractions, the project investigates dense                  dispersions by exploiting self-similar behavior and scaling                     properties.                                                                                                                                                     The approach presented in this work is unique in that                           information will be obtained at the individual droplet level                    so that coalescence rates are obtained as functions of drop                     sizes in addition to their dependence on other physical                         parameters.  The effects proposed for study in this work are                    either completely unknown or are at best ambiguous as obtained                  from studies insensitive to drop size distributions.  It is                     important to understand the foregoing effects in order to                       control dispersed phase systems so that contacting operations                   can be performed optimally with respect to conversion and                       selectivity.",
