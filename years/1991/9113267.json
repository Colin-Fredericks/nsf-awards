 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the internationalization of trade and capital, national                    regulatory agencies have encountered mounting problems of                       transnational corporations evading international law.  Many assume              that the era when business can be effectively regulated is past                 since it would be difficult to create an international system of                law with enforceable sanctions.  While this concern may be well                 placed, we can understand more about the potential and limits of                law if we consider it in the context of other aspects of a global               regulatory culture.                                                                                                                                             The purpose of the research being undertaken by Dr. Braithwaite is              to develop a theory of the emerging international regulatory order              based on a model of legal pluralism in which multiple actors and                institutions, working through a variety of formal and informal                  mechanisms, can affect regulatory outcomes.  Data from four nations             (the United States, Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Poland) for                nine areas of regulation (companies and securities regulation, the              regulation of competition, financial regulation, taxation,                      corruption, environmental protection, the regulation of hazardous               products, affirmative action, and the regulation of air travel)                 will be used.  Analysis focuses on ten different types of                       organizational actors that exert regulatory influence in the                    emerging international regulatory order, the relationships among                them, and the different mechanisms that mediate their influence.                Formal and informal sanctioning, modeling, external regulation, and             self regulation are all hypothesized as important.  The theory aims             to define and specify how the interaction between mechanisms and                actors works in shaping an international regulatory system.                                                                                                     The results of the research will not only enhance our understanding             of regulatory processes beyond the nation-state but also will                   contribute substantially to knowledge about diffusion processes and             transnational ordering.  From a scientific perspective, the study               holds promise of generating new theory that fuses national and                  international perspectives on regulation.  From a policy                        perspective, the lessons of the theory that is developed can be                 applied to the specification of new means and possibly more                     effective means by which transnational business may be regulated.",
