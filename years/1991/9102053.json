 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports cooperation between Dr.                     Richard H. Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh and Dr.                        P.P. Kane of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay,                        India.    The main research area will be the study of                           elastic scattering (Rayleigh scattering) and inelastic                          scattering (bound-electron Compton scattering) of hard                          x-rays and soft gamma rays by atoms.  The focus will be on                      the atomic physics which appears to largely determine                           photon-atom scattering.  The proposed studies will also                         provide more accurate data needed by workers in medical                         diagnostics, applied radiation physics and reactor safety.                      Objectives include the study of near-threshold effects in                       elastic scattering, and improved understanding of Compton                       scattering from tightly-bound inner-shell electrons of                          high-Z atoms.                                                                                                                                                   Scope:  The work involves joint experimental and                                theoretical research between highly-complementary ongoing                       research programs in photon-atom scattering.  The U.S. and                      Indian scientists have successfully collaborated in                             research in this area in the past.  The research has both                       basic research interests as well as potential applications                      that are beneficial to scientists and radiation                                 professionals in the two countries.  Training of students                       is an integral part of the project.  The project is being                       supported under two grants:                                                     INT 9019385 to the University of Pittsburgh;                                    INT 9102053 to the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay",
