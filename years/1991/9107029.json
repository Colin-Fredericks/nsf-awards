The                    goal of the research is the development of a family of                          technically advanced monodisperse, wide-pore, high internal                     surface area, mechanically and pH-stable, porous zirconia                       particles for use in separations science. Novel ceramic                         materials will be made that conform to the needs of the current                 and future downstream processing of biochemical materials.                      Based on the required geometric, mechanical and chemical                        characteristics of the materials, the particles will be                         optimized to accomplish a wide variety of separation tasks.                     Optimization will include chemical modification of particle                     surfaces and high and low temperature processing steps.                         Following synthesis and surface treatment, particles will be                    characterized and evaluated in a variety of end uses. This will                 be an iterative process.                                                        %%%                                                                             This research will develop a multi-faceted family of supports                   based on porous microspheres of zirconia to be used in both                     analytical and preparative-scale chromatography and in                          fluidized bed separations. The objective of the research is to                  overcome the major problems associated with silica-based                        supports by replacing silica with zirconia and to exploit the                   unique separations chemistry of this substrate.",
