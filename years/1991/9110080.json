 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Guerinot's                 proposed research on iron uptake in the model higher plant,                     Arabidopsis thaliana, using biochemical, genetic, and molecular                 genetic approaches.   Dr. Guerinot has long-standing interest in                iron metabolism, and has until now focussed on iron uptake and                  metabolism in the Bradyrhizobium/soybean symbiosis, with particular             emphasis on iron uptake and iron-stress physiology in the bacterial             partner.  She would like to expand her research to investigations               of iron uptake and metabolism in the plant partner.  To facilitate              these studies, she has proposed to work on Arabidopsis as a model               system, with the intention of ultimately transferring knowledge                 gained through these studies to studies of the soybean.                                                                                                         It is anticipated that this new line of research will significantly             enhance Dr. Guerinot's career.",
