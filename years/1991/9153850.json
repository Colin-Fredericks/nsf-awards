 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve the quality of mathematics and                        science education on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation                           through a multi-faceted program:  1)  A two day reservation-                    wide conference designed to bring together various community                    groups, along with state officials, university system                           personnel, and national leaders; 2) four intensive two-week                     summer workshops for local educators, students from BCC, and                    interested community members; 3) eight 1 to 2 day workshops                     during the regular academic year for local educators,                           students from BCC, and interested community members; 4) the                     piloting of a Mathematics and Science Associate Degree                          program involving 10 Blackfeet students.  The reservation                       wide conference will include:  education policy makers such                     as school board members and district administrators, Bureau                     of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service officials,                          Tribal Elders, Montana State University personnel, and                          officials from the Office of Public Instruction; nationally                     known Indian educators and scientists; local teachers,                          parents and students.  The focus will be the current state                      of math/science education on the Blackfeet Reservations.                        The summer workshops for 16 teachers and 10 students will                       study new methods for improving math/science education among                    American Indian students and adaptation of activities to the                    Blackfeet culture.  The academic year workshops will                            acquaint 20 educators with nationally known math/science                        curriculum projects; their content and pedagogy.                                                                                                                An unusual feature of the project is having Blackfeet                           students mentor practicing teachers to provide a cultural                       background for teachers.  Mentoring for math/science content                    in the other direction provides science/cultural balance in                     a meaningful way.                                                                                                                                               The Principal Investigator for the project is Mr. Gerard                        Vandeberg.                                                                                                                                                      Cost sharing equals 37% of the NSF award.",
