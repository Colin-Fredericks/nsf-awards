 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central problem in sensor data fusion is the recovery of                      complex, multi-component models from various sensory modalities.                An essential component of this process is a description of what                 decision must be made from the recovered model.  This description               is referred to as the sensing task.  The goal of this research                  project is to develop and analyze techniques for recovering the                 minimal or least detailed model required to make a satisfactory                 decision for a given sensing task.  In particular, the focus is                 on the task-directed recovery of composite models (models                       composed os several components).  The model recovery method is                  based on the numerical solution os systems of nonlinear                         constraints using interval bisection.  Previous work, based on                  making decisions about objects modeled by a single parametric                   form, showed that these methods are general, natural, simple to                 implement, and computationally effective.  In addition, the                     investigations were  able to incorporate notions of the cost of                 computation and the value of information into the recovery                      process, and to terminate the recovery process when the model                   with the highest net value (decision payoff minus computational                 cost) was reached.  They are now extending the underlying                       recovery method by incorporating model refinement and data                      segmentation in a manner that also exploits information about the               sensing task.  The results are expect to have particular impact                 in application area where good a priori models ar not available.                Examples of these domains include classification and sorting of                 irregular (e.g. naturally occurring) objects, supervisory                       control, and ultimately, to sensor-based control of partially or                fully autonomous vehicles.",
