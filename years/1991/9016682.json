 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                             Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,                     Lappin will continue his studies of chiral induction in                         electron transfer reactions between metal ion complexes. This                   is a relatively new field that has become an international                      endeavor and is attracting increasing attention from the                        chemical community.  While it is a very basic research area,                    potential applications of the results in the design and                         manufacture of pharmaceuticals are possible.                                                                                                                    The principal goal of the project will be the provision of                      further details on the origins and interpretation of                            stereoselectivity.  The relationship between chiral induction                   in outer-sphere reactions and chiral recognition in ion pairs                   formed as intermediates along the reaction coordinate will be                   explored.  Besides kinetic studies and product analysis, the                    work will use NMR methods to investigate weak interactions                      between ions in solution to obtain structural information.  A                   second aspect involves ligands of biological importance - amino                 acids and oligopeptides - and will focus on the additive                        effects of chiral substituents on ligand structure.                             Experiments with cyclodextrins will be initiated.  The final                    portion of the work will exploit recent success in the                          detection of stereoselectivity in inner-sphere reactions.",
