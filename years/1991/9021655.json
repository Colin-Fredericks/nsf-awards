 "awd_abstract_narration": "The choroid plexuses, which lie in the ventricles of the brain,                 are the major producers of the cerebrospinal fluid which bathes                 the mammalian nervous system.  These tissues are critical to the                maintenance of the fluid environment which surrounds and cushions               the brain and spinal chord.  A number of receptors for insulin                  and insulin-like growth factors have been localized, however, the               correlation between these growth factors and the central nervous                system has not been determined.  This research project will                     examine the effects of insulin-like growth factors on the choroid               plexus ion transport mechanisms which are essential to                          cerebrospinal fluid formation.  The intermediate steps in the                   cellular responses to the insulin-like growth factors will be                   identified.  Comparisons will be made between the mature and                    infant rat; choroid plexus transport capability and cerebrospinal               fluid production are not fully developed in infant rats, and                    specific insulin-like growth factor receptor density varies with                age.  This research will establish a link between growth factor-                receptor coupling and choroid plexus physiology and will identify               the developmental differences in insulin-like growth factor                     action on the choroid plexus.",
