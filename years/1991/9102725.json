 "awd_abstract_narration": "At a certain basic level topology merges into set theory,                  which makes it a part of the foundations of mathematics.                             The principal investigator will continue his research on                   several open questions in set-theoretic topology.  One theme is                 normality and countable paracompactness versus paracompactness in               locally compact spaces.  Several longstanding problems in this area             remain unsettled, e.g., the Arhangel'skii-Tall problem (Are normal              locally compact metacompact spaces paracompact?) and Watson's                   problem (Is there a perfectly normal locally compact non-                       paracompact space in ZFC?)  Another problem has led to interesting              combinatorics involving ladder systems that will likely have                    further applications.  Other problems to be investigated include                the existence of Dowker filters, and questions of Watson and Cook               involving connectedness.  Possible methods of solution include set-             theoretic axioms and combinatorics, and forcing.  Solutions to the              problems would deepen our understanding of fundamental topological              properties and constructions, and would likely require new                      techniques applicable to a variety of other problems.",
