 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrated Optical Circuits (IOCs) currently perform                            several operations on optical signals, and the more                             important functions are:  switching or routing,                                 amplitude and phase modulation, time delay and                                  detection.  In all cases, the structures are passive, and                       lossy, which in turn impinges on the system                                     performance.  Furthermore, couplers, interferometers                            and other components that make up these structures                              are long, up to several millimeters each.  The active                           guide structures to be used for the proposed Active                             Integrated Optical Circuits will have gain or                                   attenuation depending on the biasing condition, and                             thus loss is no longer an issue.  Since the proposed                            structures are not dependent on coupling lengths,                               these may be made in very compact form.                                         Furthermore, the guides are basically laser structures                          biased to transparency, gain or loss, and thus                                  integration with similar laser sources is feasible.                             Proposed structures in the form of Ys, Xs, and                                  crossbars may be used as switches, routing structures,                          and modulators, and these are to be investigated for                            switching speed, polarization dependence,                                       temperature, bandwidth, current loading, and noise                              contribution.  Several other optical integrated circuits                        are also possible with these active guides, but this one                        year exploratory research grant will confine itself to                          investigations of the above structures.",
