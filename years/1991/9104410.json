 "awd_abstract_narration": "Platelet aggregates form on blood vessel walls in response                 to vascular injury; they are also major constituents of the                     life-threatening blood clots associated with vascular disease and               with the use of cardiovascular prostheses.  Microscopic-scale                   models of aggregation, which involve interactions among the                     blood's fluid dynamics and the mechanics and chemistry of the                   platelets, are appropriate for studying aggregation in the small                vessels of the microcirculation.  The project will explore                      changes in the models to attain more realistic aggregate                        growth rates, and improvements in the associated numerical                      methods to extend simulations to three dimensions and to                        substantially longer time periods.  These changes will complement               recent advances in experimental technique to allow the first                    detailed comparison of simulations with experiments.  To                        facilitate these comparisons, the investigator has                              established collaborations with leading experimental scientists.                The investigator will also continue computational and analytical                exploration of a new class of continuum models he has formulated                for studying aggregation in larger vessels such as the coronary                 arteries.  Of particular interest is the chemically-induced                     liquid-to-solid phase transition exhibited by these models.  The                project will characterize its dependence on flow and chemical                   parameters.                                                                          The mathematical analysis and simulations to be carried                    out in this project complement traditional                                      laboratory experimentation.  They provide detailed information,                 of a type which is generally not attainable in the laboratory,                  about the dynamic interactions among the components of the                      aggregation response.  This additional information will increase                insight into the physical and chemical controls on the                          aggregation process.  These studies will also lay the foundations               for further development of models of aggregation and for their                  application to clinically interesting questions such as how flow                and vessel geometry interact to influence aggregation within                    natural vessels, such as the coronary arteries, or prosthetic                   devices, such as vascular grafts or artificial hearts.",
