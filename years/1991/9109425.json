 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although it is not generally possible to observe                                directly the optical field distribution in optical                              waveguiding devices, one approach to obtaining the                              information is to examine the spatial coherence                                 function (SCF) of the emitted beam.  Very little                                information has been published on the spatial                                   coherence of optoelectronic devices due to the                                  cumbersome nature of the usual measurement                                      technique (i.e. Young's double slit), and the relatively                        low optical powers in these devices.  A new fiber-                              based interferometric technique has been developed                              by the principal investigator, which, for the first time,                       allows the direct and repeatable measurement of                                 spatial coherence of low-power light beams.                                                                                                                     It is planned in this Research Initiation Award to use                          the measured SCF to determine the mode                                          distribution in the cavities of laser diodes.  Three                            possible approaches are proposed:  1) a non-rigorous                            first order analysis based on invoking the Van Cittert-                         Zernike Theorem (not strictly applicable to coherent                            sources such as lasers, but coherence effects can be                            removed by time-averaging); 2) an approach following                            that of Spano, i.e. writing down expressions for the                            first few modes in an optical cavity and predicting the                         SCF, then using the measured SCF to extract the                                 weight for each mode; and 3) adapting the algorithm                             of Tervonen et al, who presents a method for                                    computing the mode distribution from the SCF for                                Hermite-Gaussian modes (fiber), to planar                                       waveguides such as those used in laser diodes and                               optoelectronic integrated circuits.",
