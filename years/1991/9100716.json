 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue and expand a comparative study of                    similar, but geographically isolated, semi-arid montane                         ecosystems in the Peninsular Ranges within the Californian                      Biogeographic Province.  The Parque Nacional San Pedro Martir                   (SPM) in Baja California, Mexico, and the Mt. San Jacinto State                 Park (SJ) in southern California have experienced profoundly                    different management regimes during the 20th century.  SJ has                   been subject to a fire suppression policy since 1900 and to an                  exclusion of domestic livestock since 1930; in contrast,                        wildfires remain uncontrolled in SPM but livestock grazing                      intensity is extremely high.  The project will evaluate the                     result of the differing management strategies on these two                      ecosystems.  Included will be continuing documentation of past                  and current human use of the two areas, reconstruction of the                   probable vegetation patterns of the sites prior to European                     exploitation (based on diaries from the Spanish mission period of               the late 18th century), and perfection of computerized geographic               information systems for the two areas.  The researchers will                    characterize elevational, latitudinal and longitudinal gradients                in both areas and will utilize satellite remote sensing data to                 reconstruct regional fire histories.   The research will provide                for an understanding of the controls of biodiversity and of                     sustainable development in these important habitats and may be of               use in analyzing the probable of global environmental change.",
