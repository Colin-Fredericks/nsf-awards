 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Sita, who                   recently moved from Carnegie Mellon University to California                    Institute of Technology, will study the synthesis and chemistry                 of cyclic and polycyclic polystannanes. Syntheses will be                       pursued in each case by delineating the steric and electronic                   factors which govern a proposed series of reactions that lead                   to the target cyclic and polycyclic organostannanes. Once each                  synthesis has been achieved, the new organostannane will be                     studied by using a variety of spectroscopic methods in order to                 confirm its molecular structure and to investigate the nature                   of bonding to tin in the new molecular system. The data thereby                 obtained will be correlated with existing theoretical models.                   %%%                                                                             Dr. Sita's research program is concerned with elevating the                     level of understanding of the cyclic and polycyclic chemistry                   of organotin compounds to that which is presently enjoyed by                    carbocyclic systems. Dr. Sita's research on the synthesis and                   chemistry of these new systems is expected to provide new                       insight into: (i) the ways in which steric strain is expressed                  and, ultimately, accomodated structurally in cyclic and                         polycyclic organotin compounds, (ii) the development of new                     organotin-based materials, and (iii) the development of                         synthetic strategy in organotin chemistry. Dr. Sita's research                  is likely to lead to improved understanding of the various                      factors which govern structure/bonding/physical property                        relationships and chemical reactivity in systems that contain                   heavy elements (such as tin). His work in this area is likely                   to be of interest to organic and main group organometallic                      chemists as well as to structural chemists.",
