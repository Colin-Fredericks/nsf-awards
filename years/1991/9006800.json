 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vertebrate limb arose approximately five hundred million               years ago from the fins of advanced fish.  Despite this enormous                amount of time, the evolution of the limbs of vertebrate animals                has been extremely regular--certain patterns frequently recur,                  other patterns are never encountered.  Many workers have suggested              that the mechanisms of development may limit the amount of                      evolutionary change possible in different species.  This proposal               focuses on the relationships between development and evolutionary               diversity in the most primitive living group of limbed                          animals--salamanders.    Comparative and experimental studies will              enlighten the extent to which the evolutionary history of the                   salamander limb has been limited by developmental mechanisms.  In               particular, the relationship between body size, the timing of key               developmental events, and evolutionary diversity will be analyzed.                   Comparative studies of developing and adult limbs will reveal              the regularities seen in the evolution of the pattern of bony                   elements of the hands and feet of salamanders.  Experimental                    studies will reveal the manner in which developmental mechanisms                are responsible for these regularities.  Many of the regularities               seen on limb evolution may be related to the size of the developing             embryo and larva.  Changes in body size are an important trend in               salamander evolution.  Body size will be experimentally manipulated             through both chemical and surgical treatments to explore the role               of body size and the pattern of bones in salamander limbs.  These               studies will elucidate the role of an important constraint, body                size, on salamander limb evolution.",
