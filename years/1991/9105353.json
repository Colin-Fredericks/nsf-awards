 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project goals of this research proposal are:                                1) to clone and sequence the cDNAs for the two subunits of                      wheat germ eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4F (p220 and                      p26) and the two subunits of its isozyme form, eIF-(iso)4F                      (p82 and p28).                                                                  2) to identify the m7G cap binding site of p26 and p28 by                       comparing the sequences of these polypeptides to each other                     an to m7G cap binding proteins from other cells (yeast,                         mouse, human).  In addition, a comparison of the sequences of                   p220 and p82 will be made in an effort to identify the ATP                      binding site, mRNA binding and RNA helicase domains of these                    peptides.                                                                       3) to clone an sequence the cDNAs for eIF-4A and eIF-4B, to                     compare these sequences to those of obtained from other                         eukaryotic cells, and to attempt to identify functional                         domains.                                                                        4) to use the wheat cDNA clones to determine the number,                        location and sequence of the genes in Arabidopsis for eIF-4A,                   eIF-4B and the subunits of eIF-4F and eIF-iso)4F.                               5) to use the wheat cDNA clones for eIF-4A, eIF-4B and the                      subunits of eIF-4F and eIF-(iso)4F to determine the level of                    expression of these genes during various stages of plant                        development.                                                                    To achieve these goals, various methods to screen a wheat                       cDNA expression library will be used.  Antibodies to the                        initiation factors are available, as well as some knowledge                     of peptide sequences which will be used to design                               oligonucleotide probes.  DNA sequencing, Southern and                           Northern blot analysis and quantitation of mRNA will be                         carried out by established techniques.  It is not known what                    structural features of eIF-4A, eIF-4B and eIF-4F are                            important for their function.  Completion of these goals will                   provide valuable information with regard to the structural                      features of these polypeptides that are important for the                       recognition of the 5' m7G cap of mRNA, for binding to mRNA,                     for ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity and for binding of                      mRNA to ribosomes.",
