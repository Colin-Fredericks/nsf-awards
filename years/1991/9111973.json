 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project extends the unique capabilities of polarization-                based visual sensing both in low-level machine vision and                       \"higher-level\" computer vision.  The doctoral thesis written by                 the principle investigator has opened up a new subarea of vision                research utilizing reflected polarization analysis as a new                     sensory medium for object feature extraction which has been                     demonstrated to have key advantages over existing intensity and                 color-based techniques for some important image understanding                   problems.  Utilizing the fundamental foundations for these                      methods the research explores the development of a variety of                   polarization-based techniques for inspection processes in machine               vision, and object recognition in computer vision.                                 Reflected polarization analysis has provided the first                       practical methodology in vision for distinguishing and                          classifying material surfaces according to different levels of                  electrical conductivity, with metals and dielectrics at the                     extremes.  For the more controlled environments of machine                      vision, polarization-based methods are studied that significantly               improve upon existing methods for accurate non-destructive                      inspection of materials in terms of their composition and defects               such as cracks and scratches.  One potentially very useful                      application is to inspection of VLSI chips.  The research will                  also study how material classification from polarization-based                  methods can be used in computer vision to augment object                        descriptions in terms of material composition of subparts for                   object recognition.  Polarization-based methods can be very                     simply used to extract shape constraints; the project examines                  how this can be used for object recognition.  Finally, the                      research explores the application of polarization-based methods                 to color constancy, for simultaneous determination of object and                light source color.",
