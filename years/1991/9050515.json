 "awd_abstract_narration": "Architectural Engineering and Architecture students are presently               taught introductory, intermediate and advanced courses in analysis              and design of structures without any experimental type of activity.             Students have great difficulty in visualizing and thoroughly                    understanding fundamentals of structural element/system                         performance.  In the case of Architecture students, a special                   effort has to be made to overcome aversion to the subject.  Lack                of experimental activities also deprives students of the knowledge              on how to interface high-technology devices and structural                      analysis/theory.                                                                                                                                                The Department of Architectural Engineering at The Pennsylvania                 State University is committed to revise the approach to the                     teaching of structural courses to both its students and                         Architecture majors by complementing traditional class-room                     teaching with experimental and computer modelling laboratory                    activities.  The acquisition of the equipment in this project will              allow the implementation of a Structures Demonstration and Teaching             Laboratory (SDT Lab).  The laboratory will feature experimental                 testing, data acquisition and simulation systems to conduct planned             tests as well as students will improve both their creativity and                synthetic thinking.  Initially, three courses will be affected by               the implementation of the laboratory in addition to individual                  students working on their senior project.",
