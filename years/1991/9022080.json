 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hearing can provide remarkably good information on where a                      sound is in space.  Interaural cues about location of a sound                   source include the difference in intensity of the sound at the                  two ears, and the delay time between the arrival of the sound at                one ear compared to the other.  Input from both ears is important               for localizing complex as well as relatively simple sounds, but                 we do not yet understand how the brain manages this binaural                    processing.                                                                                                                                                     This project continues a computational modelling approach to                    how the mammalian auditory system compares and analyzes sounds                  presented to the two ears.  A unified theory is being developed                 to describe and predict binaural phenomena in terms of how the                  peripheral auditory system responds physiologically to various                  stimuli.  The present work will develop appropriate extensions of               models to a number of important classes of phenomena for which                  theoretical predictions are not yet adequate, including                         perception of short duration stimuli, relation of position                      perception to frequency, and application to sounds that are                     amplitude-modulated (AM) or contain high-frequency noise.  An                   important part of the work is collaboration with a group getting                experimental data on binaural listening, to provide empirical                   tests of the model predictions.  The results from                               this unique approach will be important to a fundamental issue                   of auditory science and perception, and also are likely to lead                 to applications in designing sensory aids, in designing                         displays to simulate spatial phenomena, and in developing                       systems for enhancing understanding of speech in noisy                          environments.",
