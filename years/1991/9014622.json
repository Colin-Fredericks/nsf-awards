 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Albert J. Howard, Jr., of                         Trinity College, Connecticut, for a three month visit to                        Germany to collaborate with Claus Rolfs and his group at the                    Institute for Nuclear Physics of the University of Muenster.                    They will work jointly on several projects of mutual interest                   in nuclear astrophysics.  Professor Howard brings substantial                   experience in low energy nuclear physics experimentation;                       Professor Rolfs, too, is heavily involved in experimental                       research in complementary fields of nuclear astrophysics.                       They will investigate the role of low-temperature hydrogen                      burning in the creation of the elements in the vicinity of the                  Neon/Sodium and Magnesium/Aluminum nucleosynthetic cycles.                      Professor Howard will participate in established experimental                   programs currently ongoing in the German laboratories                           directed by Professor Rolfs in Muenster and Bochum.  This                       will involve direct measurements of individual resonance                        strengths associated with the (p,gamma) reaction on pertinent                   nuclei.  Such measurements can readily be made at the world-                    class facilities in the Bochum-Muenster area; a specialized                     gamma ray detector has just been developed there that will                      provide improved sensitivity for resonance studies of the                       type proposed.  Where the size of the Coulomb barrier                           prohibits or impedes direct measurement, Professor Howard                       will contribute his expertise in indirect determination                         involving measurements of angular distributions to obtain                       single-particle transfer strengths.                                                                                                                             During the past decade, it has become increasingly clear that                   low-temperature hydrogen burning may play an important role                     during a final stage of stellar nucleosynthesis.  This                          possibility emerges from a synthesis of observations involving                  meteoritic chronology, gamma-ray astronomy, and low-energy                      proton resonance strengths associated with the Aluminum                         nucleochronometer.  It now becomes important to determine the                   reaction rates for other critical reactions associated with                     this and nearby related processing cycles.  The proposed                        measurements will provide information crucial to the                            determination of the viability of this process for synthesis                    of nuclei in the atomic mass 20-30 region.  In particular,                      the results may shed light on the possibility that the final                    reprocessing of the elements occurred prior to the formation                    of the solar system.",
