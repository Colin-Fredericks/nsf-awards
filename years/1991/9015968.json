 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor John Pinto of the University                  of California Riverside in a research collaboration with                        Professor Marco Bologna of the Universita degli Studi                           dell'Aquila, Italy.  The researchers intend to undertake                        phylogenetic studies for the tribe Meloini, a group of                          approximately 200 species belonging to the beetle family                        Meloidae.  This family is of considerable interest to                           entomologists because of several distinctive life history                       traits, and its reputation as including species that are                        pests of crops and domestic animals.                                                                                                                            The meloini is currently defined by the larval stage.  It                       includes all genera of the subfamily Meloinae known to have                     phoretic larvae, i.e. larvae that obtain their food source,                     in this case bee larvae and provisions, indirectly by                           attaching to the adult bee.  Adults of the tribe do not share                   any special similarity that indicates group membership.  This                   study proposes to analyze cladistically all available                           characters in all taxa (at the generic group level) currently                   assigned to the Meloini, taking into consideration the                          possibility that larval similarity is due to convergence and                    not homology.  Analysis of unrelated genera in the subfamily                    Nemognathinae, whose members are all phoretic as larvae, will                   be particularly instructive in this effort.  This research                      will result in a revised classification of the tribe, greater                   elucidation of the evolution of phoresy, and new information                    on the larval stages and behavior of several species of                         Meloidae.",
