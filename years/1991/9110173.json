An                                                  important step in minimizing this                                               damage is to identify sites that                                                are susceptible to liquefaction by                                              making in situ measurements of soil                                             properties related to excess pore                                               pressure development.  Existing                                                 methods of site  investigation are                                              unable to characterize a site                                                   completely because measurements are                                             made at discrete locations only;                                                the spatial variability of soil                                                 properties has to be inferred by                                                other methods.                                                                                                                                                  The objective of the first phase of                                             this project is to develop and                                                  implement seismic geotomography to                                              obtain a more complete                                                          characterization of sites                                                       susceptible to liquefaction.  In                                                seismic geotomography, a mass of                                                soil is traversed by a large number                                             of seismic waves to measure the                                                 vertical and lateral variability of                                             the initial tangent shear modulus                                               (a parameter used for liquefaction                                              susceptibility evaluation).  The                                                objective of the second phase is to                                             apply seismic geotomography at a                                                site in the Charleston, South                                                   Carolina, seismic zone so as to                                                 compare  geotomography with                                                     conventional site characterization                                              techniques, such as the standard                                                penetration test (SPT) and the cone                                             penetration test (CPT).  Soils                                                  susceptible to liquefaction are                                                 known to exist in this area.",
