 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      James Byrnes of the University of Massachusetts at Boston and                   Dr. Gavin Brown of the University of New South Wales. The                       research is to advance theoretical understanding of the                         properties of trigonometic sums with restricted coefficients,                   and to explore the application of these results to important                    engineering problems. A primary focus of the project is to                      resolve the question of how close to constant the modulus of                    a polynomial can be along a curve, typically the unit circle,                   in which case, the polynominal is a finite trigonometric sum.                   This question is important both to theoretical mathematical                     analysis because of the fundamental nature of polynominals,                     and to engineering because of the applicability of the work                     to the problem of minimizing peak to average ratios of power                    in transmitter design.                                                                                                                                          The project represents excellent collaboration between the                      U.S. and Australian researchers in that both are at the point                   of expanding their parallel expertise in classical mathe-                       matical analysis to the solution of engineering problems,                       important to both countries. This is significant fundamental                    work in an important area of mathematical research, as well                     as having the potential for solving major engineering                           problems.",
