 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in computer                      science between Dr. W. Bruce Croft, University of                               Massachusetts, and Professor Erich Neuhold, Integrated                          Publishing and Information Systems Institute, German National                   Research Center for Computer Science, Darmstadt, Germany. The                   objective of the project is to improve text retrieval models.                                                                                                   There is an increasing need for information systems that can                    provide access to complex, multimedia data.  Conventional                       database systems provide many useful data management functions,                 but have a limited capacity for handling unstructured data,                     such as text.  Dr. Croft's current research focuses on text-                    based information retrieval that uses relevance feedback                        from the searcher to modify intelligently subsequent queries                    and improve overall retrieval effectiveness.  The proposed                      cooperative work will explore ways to incorporate relevance                     feedback and probabilistic retrieval models that are used in                    text-based information retrieval with relational database                       models used in field-oriented information retrieval.   The                      approach is to represent documents and queries as separate                      directed graphs; the document will be static and the query                      graphs will be matched to the document graphs and reconstructed                 dynamically, based on feedback from the searcher. The                           research project will benefit from the complementary expertise                  of the two investigators.  Dr. Croft will work on the retrieval                 model and study the implications of this model for hypertext                    retrieval and integrated query languages.  Professor Neuhold                    will concentrate on the implications for data models, the                       actual integration with a database system, and the design of                    user interfaces for the integrated system.  The results of                      this research are expected to lead to a better understanding                    of the issues of integration, both from a theoretical                           perspective and from practical experience gained through                        building a prototype.",
