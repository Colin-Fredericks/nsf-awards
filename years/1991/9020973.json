 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Dr. Elizabeth Wing, Ms. Susan DeFrance (a                 graduate student at the University of Florida), will collect                    archaeological data for her doctoral dissertation.  Focussing on                a series of sites excavated in the Moquegua river valley in                     southern Peru, she will analyze faunal remains to determine the                 effect that the introduction of Old World domestic animals had on               the indigenous pastoral system, as well as the reciprocal                       transformation which occurred in Spanish colonial culture.  The                 sites selected span the Spanish colonial period as well as the                  altitudinal gradient from coastal plains to Andean highlands.                   The faunal materials are housed at the University of Florida as                 well as in Peru.  Ms. DeFrance will now focus on the latter.                                                                                                    Prior to the Spanish conquest of Peru, native Americans                         domesticated a number of animals including the llama, alpaca and                guinea pig, all indigenous to the region.  Because each species                 has specific environmental requirements, the distribution of each               was limited.  The introduction by the Spanish of Old World                      domesticates such as cows and donkeys created a competitive                     situation where one set of species appeared to succeed in one                   environment and the second set in another.  The details of this                 process, however, are not well understood.  Through examination                 of relevant archaeological materials Ms. DeFrance hopes to gain                 additional insight.  The research will also help to elucidate the               process of culture contact and increase understanding of how                    different ways of life affect and in turn are affected by others.                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed new               light on the early history of Peru as well as processes of                      biological and cultural interaction.  The social fabric which was               established during Spanish colonial times persists into the                     present day and much of the political unrest which characterizes                Peru today can best be explained in this context.  Finally this                 project will assist in the training of an extremely promising                   student.",
