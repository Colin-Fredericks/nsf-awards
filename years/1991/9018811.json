 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Teresa R. Chay,                      Department of  Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh,                   to pursue with Dr. Young Seek Lee, Hanyang University, for a                    period of 24 months, a program of cooperative research on                       normal/abnormal cardiac rhythms.  The research will consist                     of two parts, (1) studying the properties of single channel                     activity in the heart cells from patch-clamp recordings and                     (2) understanding cardiac arrhythmias by the theory of                          nonlinear dynamics and the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs.                     Computer simulation of impulse  initiations and propagation                     will show how changes in the ionic channel properties would                     bring the system to chaos.  These studies will allow the                        researchers to predict the onset of arrhythmias and predict                     the effect of antiarrhythmic substances known to block sodium,                  calcium, and potassium ion channels.                                                                                                                            The availability of advanced scientific computers has greatly                   expanded the possibility for using mathematical modeling as an                  approach to the study of physiological processes.  The                          ultimate goal of this research is  to develop a thorough                        understanding of the electrical phenomena that underlie the                     rhythmic activity of the heart.  The U.S. and Korean                            collaborators not only have extensive individual research                       records but also a record of successful collaboration in the                    field of the proposal.  This project is relevant to the                         objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                        which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                        U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange                   of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and                    through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean                    participation in the project is supported by the Korea                          Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  The PI's primary                   research costs are supported under NSF Grant No. DCB-8819245,                   to which the present project adds an international cooperative                  dimension.",
