 "awd_abstract_narration": "An underlying mechanism is being sought to explain the modulation               of the homeotic tuh-3 gene by maternal effect alleles.  Homeotic                mutants cause the appearance of normal anatomical structures in the             wrong location of the body.  The homeotic tumorous-head (tuh-3)                 mutant in Drosophila melanogaster was selected for these studies.               It is located at the distal end of a complex of genes (bithorax-                complex, BX-C), which provides identity to some thoracic and all                abdominal segments in the fly.  Tuh-3 and other mutants at the end              of the complex are modulated by the tuh-1 maternal effect locus at              the base of the X-chromosome.  Tuh-3 functions as a dominant mutant             in the presence of the recessive tuh-1h maternal effect, causing                genital expression in the head.  Head defects totally disappear and             tuh-3 acts as a simple recessive in the presence of the dominant                tuh-1g maternal effect allele.  In order to understand how this                 genetic system works, we have cloned tuh-1 and are determining how              tuh-3 interacts with the mutants of the distal BX-C.  We now                    propose to prove that tuh-1 has been cloned by P-element                        transformation, determine which cells in the oocyte produce the                 tuh-1 mRNA, follow its distribution pattern in the egg and embryo,              demonstrate the distribution profile for the tuh-1 protein and use              the inferred amino acid sequence to suggest a role for the protein.             At present we suspect that the tuh-1h allele yields no functional               gene product and therefore is incapable of suppressing mutant gene              activity in more anterior locations, making tuh-3 function like a               dominant mutant.  The proposed role of the wild type tuh-1g                     function is to suppress BX-C activity in the anterior of the                    embryo, causing tuh-3 to act as a simple recessive loss of function             mutant in the posterior of the embryo.  The proposed experiments                directly test this model.                                                                                                                                       Continued genetic studies of the interactions between tuh-3 and the             distal BX-C mutants should clarify the function of tuh-3 in the BX-             C, while continued physical mapping of these mutants will provide               insights into their BX-C functions and suggest where and how tuh-1              may modulate their function.***//",
