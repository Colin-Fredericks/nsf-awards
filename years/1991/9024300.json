 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for Professor Leslie E.                     Trotter to collaborate in mathematics with Professors Thomas M.                 Liebling and Dominique de Werra of the Department of Mathematics,               Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne.  They share an                 interest in polyhedral combinatorics, and will collaborate on                   three specific lines of research in that general area.  These                   current research topics are partially ordered sets, perfect                     graphs, and stability critical graphs.  The Swiss research                      group is very active and has an excellent international                         reputation in the areas of combinatorial optimization and                       operations research.  The lead Swiss collaborators have                         particularly notable research accomplishments on topics directly                related to the proposed work.  Professor Trotter is deeply                      involved in a substantial group effort at Cornell that will be                  significantly enhanced by collaboration with the group in                       Switzerland.  Previous collaboration among these investigators                  was extremely productive.                                                                                                                                       Polyhedral combinatorics is the study of the interplay between                  algebraic and geometric structure of polyhedra, on the one                      hand, and algorithmic aspects of linear objective optimization                  over polyhedra on the other.  This approach has yielded                         effective optimization algorithms for computationally difficult                 models in broadly diverse fields such as inventory control,                     statistical mechanics, VLSI, econometrics and parallel machine                  scheduling.  For example, the graph theory and algorithmic                      nature of stability critical graphs produce models with direct                  applications to forestry harvesting strategies and the allocation               of computer memory.",
