 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requsts partial support for postdoctoral fellows and              junior scientists to attend the XIth International Symposium on                 Glycoconjugates to be held June 30-July 5, 1991 in Toronto, Canada.             The host organization for this meeting is the Society for Complex               Carbohydrates, the North American component of the international                organization.  Complex carbohydrates or glycoconjugates are widely              distributed in nature, mainly as glycoproteins or glycolipids.  The             presence of carbohydrates on proteins plays a role in protein                   stability and modulates protein function.  Glycoproteins and                    glycolipids on cell surfaces confer specificity to the cells and                play a crucial role in phenomena such as the selective binding of               hormones, growth factors and toxins, the immune response,                       fertilization, differentiation, and growth, and the social behavior             of cells.                                                                                                                                                       The past decade has witnessed an extraordinary burst of activity                in glycoconjugate research, particularly because of the possible                role of carbohydrates in growth and development, and in modulation              of the immune system.  The International Symposia on                            Glycoconjugates have, over the years, been the most important                   meetings for dissemination of information in this area of research.             It will be extremely important for postdoctoral fellows and junior              scientists to be able to attend and present their work at the                   forthcoming meeting.",
