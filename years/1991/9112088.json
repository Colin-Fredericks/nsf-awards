 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern X-ray diffraction (XRD) equipment is requested.  The                     capabilities of the new equipment will include a powder                         diffractometer with a heating stage, glancing angle incidence                   optics for thin film and multilayer characterization, and a                     dedicated double-crystal X-ray diffractometer for defect                        characterization of strained-layer epitaxial thin films.                                                                                                        A study on thermal oxidation of ceramic and intermetallic matrix                composites by in situ heating in an X-ray diffractometer and                    correlation with mechanical behavior is anticipated.  Another                   research program that will benefit strongly from the new                        instrument, is analytical characterization of ceramic composites                synthesized by the novel Chemical Vapor Infiltration (CVI)                      technique.  Similarly, XRD work will be applied to chemically vapor             deposited ceramic thin films for protective coating applications,               as well as investigating in situ environmental reactions and                    microstructural changes as a function of temperature.  For                      semiconductor thin films and multilayers, determination of phase                stability and alloy formation by high temperature X-ray                         diffractometer is important for optimization of sequential                      processing steps that won't compromise device performance.",
