 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is aimed at developing a systematic                       artificial neural network (ANN) design and training methodology                 and exploring its applications in robotics.  The salient feature                of the research is the use of statistical pattern recognition                   techniques to solve some key aspects of ANN and learning                        procedures.  One major limitation of present ANNs operating under               the supervised mode of learning is that these networks are unable               to self-configure the architecture for a given classification                   problem.  A solution to this problem is to establish a direct                   relationship between a class of nonparametric classifiers, i.e.                 decision trees, and the multilayer neural networks.  It can be                  shown that a decision tree can be restructured as a three layered               neural net.  Exploiting this restructuring allows neural network                design and training methodology to have self-configuration                      capability.  The tree-to-network mapping also provides a solution               to the credit assignment problem thus making it possible to                     train each layer separately and progressively.  The research will               explore automatic tree generation, incorporation of incremental                 learning, and adaptability in such networks.  The proposed                      methodology will be applied to robot learning where networks are                required to perform regression rather than classification.  The                 main expected benefit of the proposed research is that it will                  make available an ANN design and training procedure that is                     systematic.  This should result in many more applications for                   artificial neural networks.",
