 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information on the early evolution of the higher primates                       (anthropoids) is largely known from excavations at the Fayum in                 Egypt.  Many descriptions of the Fayum fossil primates have been                published over the years but there has been little attempt to put               them in the context of an ecological setting or their ecological                relationships to other extant mammalian species.  This project                  will seek to detail the mammalian component of the Fayum                        community and any changes in its structure over time.                           Identification of species has already been initiated on the Fayum               fossils housed at Duke University and will be completed on those                in the collection at the Cairo Geological Museum.  Identification               will be accomplished through dental analysis.                                                                                                                   With data on the relative abundance of species, the PIs will be                 able to investigate changes in the composition over time and                    possibly space and thus provide a clearer picture of the origin                 of the higher primates.",
