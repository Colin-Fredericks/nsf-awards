 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research is to enhance the development of                  product requirements through a better understanding of customer                 requirements.  Customer requirements are those things that                      customers would like to see realized in a product and are usually               represented qualitatively before concepts are developed.  Product               requirements are quantitative, and measurable parameters of a                   product that will satisfy customer requirements.  For example, a                customer requirement for the ON-OFF button of a remote control may              be that \"it gives a snap feedback response against my finger when               I push it\".  From this information, the product team needs to                   develop product requirements to define the product, such as \"return             force = 6 N\" and \"button travel = 0.5 centimeters\".                                  This research is a multidisciplinary effort joining expertise              in engineering and marketing along with industrial involvement for              an endeavor that is both applicable and relevant.  Product                      requirements that are quantitative and measurable are essential for             product definition.  For design projects that involve several                   individuals, a documented set of requirements is essential for                  project management and reaching consensus among team members.                   Furthermore, developing product requirements is an essential step               in current design methods, such as Quality Function Deployment, and             Value Engineering.",
