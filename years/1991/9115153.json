 "awd_abstract_narration": "To date most models for global-scale photochemistry have                   included detailed chemistry but have represented dynamics with a                one- or two-dimensional treatment with transport based on eddy                  diffusion coefficients.  Models of this type calculate                          photochemical production and loss terms based on concentrations                 of nitrogen oxides and other species averaged over an entire                    latitude band.  They omit the geographical variation in nitrogen                oxides concentrations which ranges over three orders of                         magnitude.  Models of this type cannot be used to evaluate                      species concentrations in specific locations (e.g. the north                    Atlantic) that have complex source-receptor relations.  Even the                calculation of global average species concentrations may be                     flawed due to nonlinearities in the chemistry.  Photochemical                   production and loss rates are very different in polluted                        environments or in regions of biomass burning than in remote                    continental or marine locations, and rates also depend on local                 meteorology.  Models for global photochemical production and                    loss must account for these differences.                                             This project is designed to develop a realistic chemical                   module which, while capable of simulating the complex nitrogen,                 hydrocarbon and ozone chemistry associated with atmospheric                     pollution, will run efficiently and effectively in a global                     chemical transport model.  The chemical module will be developed                and tested in the GFGL global chemical transport model.                         Successful development of a chemical module that realistically                  simulates photochemical production and loss of nitrogen oxides                  and ozone and that economically operates in a global transport                  model offers a number of scientific benefits.  Accurate three                   imensional models are an essential tool for evaluating                          photochemical evolution in the global troposphere in a way that                 includes geographical variation and the episodic nature of                      meteorological events.  A three dimensional model also allows                   direct comparison of results with observed species                              concentrations.",
