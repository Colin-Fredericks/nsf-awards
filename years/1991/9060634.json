 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is development of                                 practical, multivariate model predictive control (MPC)                          for fossil power plants.  The approach used here                                involves the development of a generic, reduced-order                            model (ROM) which captures the dominate static and                              dynamic characteristics of power plants.  This model is                         necessary in order to predict the plant behavior.  Since                        the model will not exactly match the true plant                                 structure, the parameters of the model must be                                  estimated using prediction error methods or nonlinear                           least squares.  This model will then be used in a                               Kalman filter to estimate process states in real-time.                          These estimated states used for prediction, enabling the                        computation of the optimal control sequence.                                                                                                                    The research builds on the results of a preliminary                             study which attempted to demonstrate feasibility of the                         approach.  The results were encouraging but much                                more work is needed to make the approach practical.                             In particular, the current structure of the ROM does                            not adequately model the behavior of a plant and thus                           more modeling work is required.  Another problem is                             the computational burden, which currently precludes                             real-time operation on a microcomputer.  Several                                approximation techniques can potentially reduce the                             burden by a factor of ten.  Finally, parameters of the                          MPC algorithm (weighting and control step size) must                            be evaluated to achieve the best performance.  The                              successful application of the method will enable                                increased efficiency and availability, and reduced                              maintenance and pollution.",
