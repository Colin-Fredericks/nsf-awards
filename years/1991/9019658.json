 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Robert Santley and                his colleagues will conduct two seasons of archaeological                       research in the Tuxtlas Mountains of southern Veracruz, Mexico.                 ThIs will center around the large Classic period site of                        Matacapan which has been the focus of past research by the                      investigator.  With the assistance of aerial photographs several                teams will carry out a broad scale regional survey designed to                  include all major environmental zones.  The location of all sites               will be noted.  During the second season, more intensive work                   will focus on more limited regions.  Ceramics and other cultural                materials will be collected from the surface.  This will be                     complemented by a limited number of excavations.  Data will be                  analyzed to reconstruct the regional settlement, economic and                   political systems and to show how these developed and changed                   over time.                                                                                                                                                      The Matacapan region is of particular interest for the light it                 can shed on prehistoric Middle American society.  Prior work has                shown that contrary to what is observed in other parts of this                  region, the Matacapan area exhibited a dendritic form of                        organization where settlements are arranged in an economic and                  political hierarchy with clearly defined size ranks.  It also                   appears that the economy was highly centralized in a dendritic                  form where very few goods passed horizontally among units of                    similar size, but rather flowed upwards to larger centers. The                  site of Matacapan which sits at the top of the hierarchy seems to               be a major trading center both for pottery and obsidian which was               highly prized for making stone tools.  While extensive work has                 been conducted at Matacapan itself, to understand how the broader               regional system operated, wide scale survey work is necessary.                                                                                                  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to a wide group of Middle American                             archaeologists.  It will not only increase our understanding of                 how prehistoric societies functioned, but also provide insight                  into the mechanisms which control small scale societies in many                 parts of the third world today.",
