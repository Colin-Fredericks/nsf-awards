 "awd_abstract_narration": "Xylaria is a large (at least 400 names and ultimately 500 or               more species) widely distributed fungal genus (Family                           Xylariaceae, Order Sphaeriales, Subdivision Ascomycotina).  Many                taxa occur on wood, seeds and fruits, and leaves of angiospermous               plants; some taxa are associated with insect nests.  Most taxa                  decay wood and a large number are plant pathogens.  They are                    common endophytes.  Xylaria and its allies are most numerous in                 the tropics where they form a conspicuous part of the mycota.                   Many taxa are endemic and likely to become extinct as hosts are                 destroyed.  Mycofloristic studies that include cultural,                        anamorphic, cytological, structural, and life history data are                  proposed.  It is proposed herein:  to continue studies of Xylaria               from the Guianas; to treat Xylaria and its allies from Taiwan; to               complete treatments of Xylaria from continental United States,                  Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  Longer term objectives include a                      treatment of Xylaria of the neotropics and, eventually, a world                 monograph.",
