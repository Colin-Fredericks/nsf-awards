The results of this research will give                 new understanding to the mechanism of formation of the recently                 discovered C60 allotrope of carbon, which possesses a geodesic                  (Buckminster Fuller) structure. In addition, reaction of C60 will                                                                                               be studied. There is intense interest in the formation, reactions,                                                                                              and properties of this allotrope of carbon (graphite and diamond                are examples of other allotropes of carbon).                                                                                                                    It is thought that atomic carbon forms small reactive fragments,                which then undergo further reactions to eventually produce C60.                 This hypothesis will be tested in experiments designed to trap the                                                                                              smaller fragment precursors to C60. Abstractable hydrogen will be                                                                                               added to the helium bath gas as the trapping reagent, with the                  expectation that the size of carbon clusters which are trapped                  will be directly proportional to bath gas pressure and inversely                proportional to the amount of trapping reagent. In addition, the                reactions of some reactive intermediates (carbenes and benzyne)                 with C60 will be studied. Reaction of chromium hexacarbonyl with                C60 will also be explored.",
