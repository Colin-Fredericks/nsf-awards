 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research and conservation efforts in the Neotropics (South and             Central America) are dependent upon access to information on the                organisms inhabiting this particular region.  Many areas within the             Neotropics are undergoing rapid environmental deterioration,                    eliminating biological diversity and ultimately affecting our                   ability to understand the biology and history of the natural                    resources of this part of the world.  Research programs in diverse              fields such as population and community ecology, biogeography,                  systematics and evolution, and conservation efforts to protect and              manage these resources are often hampered by our inability to                   obtain access to the kind of information already available on these             organisms in the research collections of universities and major                 museums.                                                                             Recent achievements in computer-aided collection information               management have reached a level of sophistication which permit                  efforts to inventory and enhance this biodiversity information and              make these resources more available to the research and                         conservation community.  This project will produce an                           international, inter-institutional inventory database of                        collections information on the freshwater fishes of South and                   Central America.  Three major research institutions will cooperate              to build a centralized database of biodiversity information on                  fishes now held in several widely-scattered institutions.  Such                 information includes species identification and taxonomic                       information, geographic locality and associated collection, habitat             and environmental data.  Data from several North American and Latin             American institutions will be combined into a single database.  The             project will enhance access to and provide additional research                  tools for this centralized database.  The Academy of Natural                    Sciences of Philadelphia will coordinate building of the database               and development of new research tools.  The University of Michigan              will serve as the liaison to the Latin American participants,                   providing technical support and remote access to the database.                  Cornell University will provide support for developing the                      interface between the central database and MUSE, the NSF-sponsored              collection management system.                                                        The results of this project will greatly improve the ability               of researchers to gain access to Neotropical fish biodiversity                  information for use in ecological, biogeographic, evolutionary,                 and conservation initiatives.  This work will also stimulate new                lines of research on the fish fauna that otherwise would not be                 possible nor feasible.  Access to the information facilitated by                this project will likely stimulate local economies by means of new              economic initiatives on the commercial exploitation and management              of renewable fisheries resources.  Finally, this project will                   directly assist cooperative research land efforts to stimulate                  continued interchange between North American scientists and their               Latin American counterparts.",
