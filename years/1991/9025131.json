 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop               suitable networking concepts for mobile networks, along with                    analytical models and methodology that permit both theoretical                  prediction of system performance and examination of parameter                   tradeoffs. Of particular interest are techniques that provide                   intelligent features in the sense that they enable mobile networks              to maintain performance levels by adjusting and adapting to changes             in the communications environment.  Dynamic control, assignment,                and reallocation of communication resources due to changes in                   traffic loading, interference, and topology will be investigated                for cellular and non-cellular configurations.  Areas to be                      investigated include: techniques for managing hand-offs of                      communicating platforms; use of spatial macro-diversity features;               and dynamic control and assignment of communications assets -                   including both borrowing and sharing of channels and gateways.                  Procedures to accomplish this may involve mixtures of central and               distributed control.  Appropriateness of the techniques for various             settings will be considered.                                                         Analytical modeling and computer simulation will provide the               primary underlying bases.  It is expected that as a result of this              investigation new techniques will be devised that will allow                    improved communications with large numbers of mobile platforms over             wide geographical areas.  In addition, the analytical models and                approach will provide tan enhanced foundation for understanding,                modeling, and designing mobile communications networks.",
