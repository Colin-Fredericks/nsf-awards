 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important area of current astronomical research concerns the                 study of mass loss of red giant stars as they evolve to white                   dwarfs through the \"planetary nebula\" stage.  Although this                     research is significant to an understanding of stellar evolution                in its own right, it is also important because planetary nebulae                are bright and may be observed comparatively easily.  Thus,                     planetary nebulae are particularly convenient objects to study to               learn the properties of \"circumstellar matter\", material which has              has been recently ejected from hot stars in densities intermediate              between stellar and interstellar gas material.   Matter in a                    similar state also occurs around stars for different reasons, in                particular as \"disks\" around interacting binary stars, B-emission               stars, and dense molecular interstellar clouds.  However, in these              environments it is often difficult to observe this gas and to                   diagnose its properties.  The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes              to continue previous NSF-supported research on the physical and                 chemical properties of matter as it leaves the star in a dense                  \"wind\" and eventually mingles with ambient interstellar gas.  The               PI will determine reaction rates among atoms, molecules, and                    radiation (starlight) in order to understand the distribution of                forms of matter (ions, neutral atoms, and molecules).  Because                  these atoms radiate away thermal energy that they absorb from gas               motions, this knowledge will lead to an understanding of the                    temperature and density of matter at different distances from the               star.  Comparisons of these theoretical predictions can then be                 made with new observations from radio (millimeter wavelength)                   arrays.  The correctness of the models will then be evaluated.",
