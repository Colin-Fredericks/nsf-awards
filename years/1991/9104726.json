 "awd_abstract_narration": "The national park model of wildlife conservation has been widely           used in many countries.  With population growth and the ensuing increase        in pressure on land and resource use, however, conflicts have escalated         among local farmers and pastoralists trying to sustain themselves and           park officials trying to protect the wildlife as a valuable national and        global resource.  This doctoral dissertation project will study two             national parks in Kenya in order to illuminate the complex socioeconomic        and ecological problems involved in national park wildlife conservation         efforts.  Interviews at the levels of family, village, and local                conservation officials will be used to identify the social factors that         shape the success or failure of conservation.                                                                                                                      This project will provide valuable information about the                     perceptions and attitudes of local people toward wildlife and how these         in turn relate to the role that local people might play in the                  conservation of wildlife.  This project also will provide an excellent          opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop                independent research skills.",
