 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of               Massachusetts - Amherst supports interactive, interdisciplinary                 research in polymer science and engineering organized into three                major thrust areas.                                                                  Thrust research on pattern formation in polymer systems has                evolved from earlier work in the MRL on polymer blends.  It                     focusses on structure and pattern formation in multiphase polymer               systems, including both blends and liquid crystals.  Researchers                in the thrust area on polymers in restricted geometries are                     synthesizing and characterizing novel polymeric films and                       surfaces, investigating their corresponding properties, and                     studying polymer adsorption processes.  A new thrust on ordered                 polymeric solids is devoted to novel approaches to polymer                      synthesis, characterization of new periodic polymer morphologies,               processing and property prediction.  A major emphasis is placed                 on novel polymers of precisely defined structure produced by                    incorporating biochemical techniques into the synthetic                         procedures.                                                                          The MRL also supports the development, maintenance and                     operation of central research facilities for characterization,                  morphology and rheology determination, spectroscopy, and                        computation.  It also provides seed funding for exploratory                     research and new initiatives in materials research, and supports                programs to foster increased participation by minorities and to                 provide experience in polymer research for undergraduates.  The                 research program currently involves 19 faculty members from four                departments, 3 postdoctoral research associates, 19 graduate                    students and 15 undergraduates, and supporting technical and                    clerical staff.  The MRL at the University of Massachusetts,                    Amherst is directed by Professor David A. Tirrell.",
