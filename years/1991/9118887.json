 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Complex Carbohydrate Structure Database (CCSD), an IBM PC-                  compatible computerized database, and CarbBank, the database                    management system were created to provide structure and citation                information system to meet the needs of persons interested in                   complex carbohydrates.  CCSD and CarbBank, which were initiated                 by an international body of carbohydrate scientists, have been in               development since 1986 and have been commercially available since               1989.  We propose to continue developing CarbBank-associated                    software, to continue building the CCSD, and to make this                       software available as part of larger database efforts                           administered by the National Center for Biotechnology Information               (NCBI) and by Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS).  We intend to                   create a completely open format for the CCSD and portable, well-                documented program modules that will ultimately be available to                 academic and commercial groups interested in creating computer                  programs that access CCSD data.  The CCSD and CarbBank will also                be made compatible with several additional computer environments.               The CCSD is expected to grow from its present 3,888 records to                  over 20,000 records.  It is our goal to ensure that CarbBank                    plays a key role in managing carbohydrate structure information                 in the global biotechnology arena.",
