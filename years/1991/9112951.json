 "awd_abstract_narration": "The glacial-interglacial history of tropical climate is                 controversial. The record from marine sediments in the tropics                  suggests that there has been little change in atmospheric                       temperature in these regions.  On the other hand the climate                    record from tropical highlands documents that snowlines, glaciers               and treelines were all at lower elevation during the last                       glaciation.  These elevation changes translate into 5 to 6 degree               lower surface temperatures in the glacial tropics.  The                         discrepancies may be resolved with better paleoclimate proxies                  for lowland tropical locations.  Unfortunately it is difficult to               work on tropical samples because some traditional paleoclimate                  indices, like tree                                                              rings, are not related to tropical climate in a simple way.  This               proposal suggests an alternative methodology which may provide                  paleoclimate records on the basis of wood anatomy.  The basis for               the methodology is that wood porosity will vary as a function of                climate.                                                                             The proposal requests support to test the theory in a study                area along the western coast of Costa Rica.  Although it is a                   high risk proposal, it is important because it may provide a new,               reliable method for reconstructing climate in tropical locales.",
