 "awd_abstract_narration": "RNA polymerase is the principal enzyme of gene expression and the               target for genetic regulation.  Its basic structure-functional                  features are highly conserved among all living organisms. The broad             goal of this project is the understanding of the molecular                      mechanism of RNA polymerase basic function.  To this end a combined             genetic and biochemical approach will be taken using as model the               RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli.  The collaboration takes                  advantages of the biochemical strength of the U.S. side and                     specifically, it is proposed to generate an exhaustive collection               of in-frame linker insertions and deletions in the cloned gene rpoB             which encodes the B subunit of core RNA polymerase. The mutant RNA              polymerase holoenzyme (a2BBo) will then be prepared for biochemical             characterization by in vitro reconstitution from the individual                 subunits.  The subunits will be obtained by overexpressing them                 from plasmids carrying the three rpo genes under the control of                 inducible promoter.  The malfunctioning of RNA polymerase caused                by the mutations will be characterized using an arsenal of in vitro             assays which would allow to monitor and quantitate individual steps             of the enzyme's functional cycle. This approach is anticipated to               define and map the structural elements of the enzyme which carry                out the multitude of RNA polymerase biochemical functions.",
