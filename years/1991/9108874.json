 "awd_abstract_narration": "The country of Ghana possesses a long tradition of democratic                   political thought vigorously defended by a small number of Ghana's              most prominent families.  When Ghana achieved its independence from             Britain, democracy was not established and these families faced                 severe economic and political adversity. Nevertheless the families              survived and remain an influential force for democratic reform.                                                                                                 This doctoral dissertation research will undertake extensive field              research in Ghana in an attempt to understand how these families                have survived in post independence Ghana.  Drawing upon theories                of rational choice it will attempt to understand the ways in which              these individuals acted to advance both their private and group                 interests, how they withstood the attacks by the government, and                what strategies they used.                                                                                                                                      In addition to expanding our knowledge of African politics, this                study promises to increase our understanding of the relationship                between individual rights, egalitarianism, and economic                         development.",
