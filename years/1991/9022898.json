 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both the theory of environmental regulation and the theory of                   international trade generally assume fixed plant locations that                 are exogenous to policy changes.  The analysis tends to focus on                firms' marginal price and output responses to policy changes,                   such as emission controls or tariff rates.  It is the nature of                 these models that responses are small and continuous, implying                  that optimal tax or tariff rates can be calculated.  However, it                is well understood by policy makers that plants are of discrete                 size due to scale economies, and that plant location decisions                  are endogenous to cost differentials across regions or countries.               Regional and increasingly national governments are explicitly                   taking the endogeneity of these location decisions into account                 in designing policies which attract firms or which may raise the                costs of local production.  To date, economic theory and                        empirical work has shed little on these important policy                        questions.                                                                                                                                                      The purpose of this project is to conduct both a theoretical and                empirical analysis of environmental and trade policies when the                 location decisions of large manufacturing, utility, or resource-                based plants are endogenous.  Attention well be focused on cases                where the firm in question can make choices between politically                 independent locations, to allow for the possibility of                          inefficient political competition between regions.  Non-                        cooperative outcomes can then serve as a benchmark from which to                evaluate the gains from policy coordination.  Models will be                    constructed to analyze the effects of trade liberalization                      between the U.S. and Mexico, and tougher environmental policies                 in the U.S. on the North American location of plants in the auto                and chemical industries.",
