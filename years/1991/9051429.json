 "awd_abstract_narration": "New device simulation and layout tools and a new device                    fabrication process are being developed for the Caltech                         freshman course in solid state devices and integrated                           circuits, a two-quarter sequence offered annually to                            approximately 90 majors and non-majors.  The unusual goal                       of this class is to excite interest among freshman in solid                     state electronics in particular, and engineering in general.                    Hence the underlying curricular strategy is to appropriately                    simplify device physics to the level of intuition and simple                    mathematics, and to simplify the fabrication process as much                    as possible so as to make the first undergraduate laboratory                    experience very positive.  To this end, design of a software                    toolbox for device simulation and layout enables freshmen to                    better understand device operation at an intuitive level and                    to avoid design mistakes in device and circuit layout.  A                       new fabrication process centered around the use of                              spin-dopants will allow use of both n-type and p-type dopants                   with greater ease, reliability and safety.                                           Device simulation and layout tools and the use of both                     dopant types will enable the present curriculum to be                           expanded to the design and fabrication of bipolar and CMOS                      devices while retaining the simplicity crucial for the                          process.  This will be a significant advance in the                             teaching of undergraduate courses in the design and                             fabrication of microelectronic devices.",
