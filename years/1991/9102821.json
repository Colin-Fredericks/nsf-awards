 "awd_abstract_narration": "Database management systems efficiently organize, access and                    manipulate enormous quantities of data for traditional business                 applications. This efficiency is based on indexing records by one               attribute, such as social security number. However, new                         applications in both science and business require indexing on                   several attributes. Astronomers and geographers want data to be                 organized spatially; businesses want to study trends over time.                 This project continues work on spatial and temporal indexes which               have already been demonstrated to be efficient.  A new node                     consolidation and concurrency algorithm will be applied to the                  Holey Brick tree, a spatial index with guarantees for space                     utilization and query speed. This will enable scientists to make                sophisticated queries on spatial data while records are being                   inserted and deleted.  The Time Split B-tree (a time-and-key                    based indexing system) will be enhanced by limiting the time-                   interval size and by managing the timestamping of records.  Last,               ways are being found to create indexes and do other                             reorganizations of data while the DBMS is online.The results of                 this project will aid in the management of anticipated non-                     traditional applications on massive collections of data in both                 science and in business.",
