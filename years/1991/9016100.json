 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Hantao Zhang, Department of Computer Science, University of                     Iowa, and Drs. Emmanuel Kounalis and Michael Rusinowitch,                       Centre de Recherche en Informatique de Nancy (CRIN), France.                    The objective of the project is to justify good techniques to                   be used in Logic Programming for handling the equality                          relation.                                                                                                                                                       Horn Logic, a restriction of first order logic, has provided                    a most useful logical basis for many applications in computer                   science, for example, expert systems, database systems,                         algebraic specifications, logic programming, and symbolic                       calculus. In many applications of Horn Logic, it is important                   to incorporate the equality relation into the logic. Because                    Horn clauses will be interpreted as conditional rewrite                         rules and rewriting techniques will be used to handle the                       equality relation, the investigators in this project propose                    to carry out theoretical research to study different rewriting                  and completion techniques.  The results of the study will be                    implemented in a software system called RRL (the Rewrite Rule                   Laboratory), a theorem prover for experimenting with and                        developing new automated reasoning procedures based on                          rewrite methods. RRL has been successfully used for solving                     problems often considered a challenge for mechanized theorem                    provers, including significant applications in verification                     and specification of hardware and software.  The focus of                       this project will be to implement in RRL a Prolog-like                          interpreter and to experiment with different rewriting                          techniques.  Further investigations will also be conducted on                   methods for analyzing structural properties of logic programs,                  such as consistency, termination and definitional completeness                  and for computing in incompletely specified logic programs.                     The project will benefit from the complementary expertise of                    the US and French investigators in symbolic computation.",
