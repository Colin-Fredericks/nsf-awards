 "awd_abstract_narration": "As an approach to the common synthetic problems of selectivity,                 yield optimization, ease of product isolation, and efficiency                   with regard to use of expensive reagents, it is planned to                      explore the application of functionalized polymer systems to                    complex problems in organic synthesis.  The principle of                        covalent substrate anchoring to control chemoselectivity has                    already been successfully demonstrated in the context of                        intermolecular Pauson-Khand cycloaddition.  This work will                      first be expanded to intramolecular systems to establish its                    scope and range.  It will then be extended to several diverse                   synthetic processes.  Polymer linkage of nitroalkanes will be                   studied to control tandem cycloaddition/electrophilic                           cyclizations of nitrile oxides with alpha, omega-dienes,                        permitting stereocontrolled synthesis of differentially                         substituted cyclic ethers.  Next, polymer methodology will be                   applied to asymmetric synthesis by covalent attachment of                       chiral auxiliaries to enhance chemical yields, improve optical                  yields, and simplify recovery of the chiral auxiliaries.                        Pauson-Khand systems will be tested as routes to optically pure                 polyquinanes, using polymer-bound chiral alcohols.                              Polymer-bound chiral oxazolines will be used as auxiliaries in                  stereoselective aza-Claisen rearrangements to generate                          optically active 4-pentenoic acids.  Finally, a range of                        polymer-bound systems of C2-symmetry will be developed as means                 to approach the synthesis of a variety of differentially                        functionalized nonracemic synthetic systems.                                                                                                                    The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting this joint project                  between Dr. Neil Schore and Dr. Mark Kurth to develop new                       synthetic reagents that are based upon polymers.  The former's                  background in organometallic and polymer chemistry is being                     melded with the latter's background in the synthesis of complex                 organic molecules.  These new synthetic reagents will simplify                  techniques and lead to more economic and convenient syntheses.",
