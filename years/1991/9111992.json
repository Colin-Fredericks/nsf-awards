 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI has been conducting extensive research                                   supported by NSF in three major areas:  millimeter-                             wave remote sensing of geophysical media; bistatic                              scattering from rough surfaces; and modeling of                                 forest canopy at the microwave region.  All three                               areas require studying interaction of waves with                                random or inhomogeneous natural media.  Major                                   objectives are the development of basic information                             on microwave and millimeter-wave remote sensing.                                Thus far efforts have been directed to extensive                                experimental and theoretical investigations.  Over the                          past 10 years, the PI has developed a mobile truck                              mounted radars at L, C, X, and millimeter-wave                                  frequency bands.  Experimental studies, however,                                have been limited by the speed and reliability of the                           data acquisition system and controllers.  The fast data                         acquisition system and computers provided in this                               NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant should                                 advance the ability to conduct experiments in situ and                          to develop theoretical models of wave interactions                              with geophysical media.",
