 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds from this program are being used to acquire laboratory                    equipment and computers for use in an introductory and advanced                 optics laboratory course for physics and engineering majors.                    The laboratory courses are a part of a new optics program being                 instituted at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville. The                    introductory laboratories are designed to use computers both as                 an aid to the collection of data, and for data analysis and                     modeling of optical systems. The advanced laboratory is                         designed to introduce students to lasers, fiber optics, and                     holography, and to provide them with a suitable background for                  conducting research in optics. While the field of optics has                    grown tremendously in terms of its technological importance, it                 is significant that there are no established optics programs at                 public institutions of higher education in the state of                         Illinois. The objective of the program is to use faculty                        expertise in the field of optics to develop a model optics                      curriculum that provides students with a marketable                             specialization in optics. Major instrumentation purchased under                 this program includes computers and data acquisition hardware,                  along with optical components for student use in experiments in                 holography, fiber-optics, spectroscopy, and thin-film physics.                  In addition, the equipment is being used in an annual series of                 workshops for high-school science students throughout the St.                   Louis area.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from                    non-federal sources.",
