 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports collaborative activities in physics                         research between U.S. and Latin American physicists.  There                     are three principal investigators: Leon Lederman, President                     of AAAS, Leo Falicov of the University of California at                         Berkeley and Roy Rubinstein at Fermilab.  The award will                        foster international research collaboration and the interchange                 of scientific information among scientists and engineers in                     the U.S. and several Latin American countries.  It will                         provide funds for attendance at conferences, to support                         workshops, for journal subscriptions and to have access to                      experimental materials.                                                                                                                                         These funds for such activities will be catalytic support to                    qualified scientists in Latin America to help them to                           contribute effectively to international and thus to U.S.                        science.  Clearly this kind of support will have a direct and                   positive effect on the infrastructure of Latin American                         physics.  Thus the mutual benefit to the U.S. and Latin                         America is evident and the goals of the Science in Developing                   Countries program will be fulfilled.",
