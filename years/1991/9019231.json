 "awd_abstract_narration": "The isotopic composition of seawater boron (11B/10B) is highly                  enriched (~40 per mil) relative to fresh mantle derived rocks.                  Initial work indicates that this enrichment is primarily the                    result of large isotopic fractionations associated with the                     alteration of the oceanic crust.  In addition, the boron                        isotopic composition of the altered crust is dominated by                       seawater boron that appears to be distinct from the mantle and                  may be composed of compositionally distinct domains.  As a                      result, it appears that boron isotopes have a great potential                   for elucidating a number of geochemical and geophysical                         problems associated with the alteration of the oceanic crust.                   These include the role of subducted volatiles in island-arc and                 ocean island volcanism, the evolution of hydrothermal fluids                    and secular changes in seawater/crust exchange.                                                                                                                 This study of seawater/oceanic crust boron isotope exchange has                 the following specific goals:  1) to determine the distribution                 of boron and boron isotopes within  the altered crust, 2) to                    quantify the net flux and isotopic composition of boron                         extracted from seawater into the oceanic crust and 3) to                        develop the essential background data that are required for the                 future exploitation of boron isotopes as a diagnostic tool in                   the study of hydrothermal systems.",
