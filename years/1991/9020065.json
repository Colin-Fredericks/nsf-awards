 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to extend the fossil record in time, fill              in gaps, and study the fossils themselves in a site in China which              will be important in understanding global change.  This research                will provide more precise age control to specify when and how                   faunal change occurred, thereby providing data relevant to theory               on community change.  It will provide data to test the hypothesis               that faunal change in Asia and North America was synchronous and                driven, in part, by global climatic events.  It will show timing,               direction, and nature of exchange of terrestrial fauna between Asia             and North America.                                                                   The best and most accessible record of mammalian history in                northeastern Asia during the last six million years is Yushe Basin,             Shanxi Province, People's Republic of China.  The record is good                because it contains, in one upland valley/lake setting, superposed              fossil assemblages of late Miocene to Pleistocene age.  Previous                collaborative work between American geologists and Chinese                      researchers has outlined the faunal succession and provided the                 time scale for it.  The additional goals above will be met by one               month of field work and by continued museum research, primarily in              Beijing and New York.",
