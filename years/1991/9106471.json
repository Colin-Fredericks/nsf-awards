 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four approaches will be used to investigate the electronic                      excited states of metal-containing molecules under conditions                   ranging from single crystals at low temperatures to the gas                     phase.  The first group of experiments is the detailed                          assignment of excited states by using single crystal polarized                  spectroscopy.  The second component of the program is the                       determination of excited state distortions from vibronic                        structure in electronic spectra.  The experiments will focus on                 emission and excitation spectra of molecules in the cold                        collision-free conditions of a supersonic free expansion jet as                 well as in condensed media.  The third group of experiments                     will determine excited state distortions from analysis of                       resonance Raman excitation profiles.  Thus, the excited states                  can be examined mode by mode even when the electronic spectrum                  is broad and featureless.  Finally, the geometries of molecules                 in excited states will be measured by using excited state                       pump-probe Raman spectroscopy.  The goal of all of the                          experiments is the unified understanding of excited state                       orbital characteristics, potential surface displacements and                    geometries of metal compounds.                                                  %%%                                                                             In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                             Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Jeffrey                   I. Zink of the University of California at Los Angeles will                     continue studies of the determinations of excited state                         properties of metal-containing molecules by spectroscopic                       methods.  These studies provide crucial, fundamental                            information necessary for the understanding of many                             photochemical processes in which sunlight is used as an energy                  source.",
