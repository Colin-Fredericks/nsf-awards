 "awd_abstract_narration": "A parallel computing laboratory facility is being established                   for developing a distinct course in parallel computing and                      upgrading the instructional content of other undergraduate                      computer science courses that make use of parallel concepts.                    This includes, but is not limited to, analysis of algorithms,                   operating systems, programming languages, artificial                            intelligence, senior projects, data base systems, and numerical                 analysis.  The project utilizes an existing network host-server                 that will be connected to a multiple-processor parallel                         computer system using Transputers.  The Transputer system and                   related software for parallel programming is being purchased as                 part of the grant.  Course modules are being developed                          initially as part of special topics courses and then are being                  allowed to migrate as appropriate to other courses in the                       curriculum, including a separate course on parallel computing                   that is to be developed.  As parallel computing takes on more                   significance in the real world of computer systems the project                  will be used to strengthen the related foundations of computer                  science education and give students experience in a variety of                  parallel computing applications.",
