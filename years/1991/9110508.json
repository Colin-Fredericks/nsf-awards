 "awd_abstract_narration": "Image compression is the process of reducing the amount of data                 required to store or transmit an image.  It has traditionally been              done with little regard for image processing operations that may                precede or follow the compression step.  It is proposed to                      investigate areas in which image compression and image processing               may be combined into a single operation, and also areas in which                image compression may lead to improved or simpler image processing              operations.  Vector quantization algorithms for the compression of              halftoned binary images will be developed and images will be                    compared that are first compressed and then halftoned with images               that are halftoned and then compressed.  Vector quantizers that can             simultaneously perform both compression and image processing tasks              such as halftoning, inverse Fourier transforming, and contract                  enhancement will also be investigated.  This will lead to a                     reduction in computational complexity if the complexity of the                  compression step is less than that of the image processing                      operation.  Finally, examinations will be done to see if image                  compression will lead to simpler or improved image processing                   operations such as image segmentation, target detection, and pre-               screening for suspect regions in medical images.",
