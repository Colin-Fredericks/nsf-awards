 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is directed towards determining the feasibility of                     developing an educational software package, for use by                          undergraduate level engineering students, which would demonstrate               and aid in teaching semiconductor device physics.  The software                 would be used as an adjunct to classroom studies in a workshop                  format.  A variety of fundamental device structures including                   diodes, FETs, and bipolar devices would be included in the software             which would demonstrate the internal device physics through two                 dimensional simulation.  Graphic display of the results who vividly             show the student how the device operated internally.  The Phase I               research would investigate the feasibility of performing the                    required simulations efficiently (run times on the order of a                   minute) and would construct an initial version of the software for              a FET.  This initial software would then be introduced to students              at a local university to solicit their feedback and further define              their need from such software.  This research would be continued                under Phase II and under Phase III, it is anticipated that a                    commercially viable education tool, marketable to the undergraduate             university community would be produced.",
