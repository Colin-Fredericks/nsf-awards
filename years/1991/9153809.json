 "awd_abstract_narration": "WGBH in collaboration with The Children's Museum will                           demonstrate how video technology can be used as an effective                    tool for teacher training in science.  The children's Museum                    current NSF project is developing a set of curriculum                           materials and teaching strategies to increase the                               effectiveness of science education in the middle schools and                    to encourage minority and female students to continue in                        science.  It brings together Bernie Zubrowski of The                            Children's Museum, who has run successful \"hands-on\" science                    education sessions for 25 years, teachers in Boston public                      schools, and the Massachusetts Pre-Engineering program,                         providing minority scientists in the classroom as                               participants and role models.  This combination provides an                     unusually fertile opportunity for documentation and                             instruction.  The WGBH project will produce three forty                         minute teacher training videotapes designed to support                          teachers who are attempting to implement this new type of                       instruction in their middle school classes.  The training                       tapes will be augmented by supporting print material -- a 24                    page guide for teachers viewing the tapes as well as a 16                       page guide written for college and university instructors                       who train teachers.  A full range of dissemination                              activities is also planned.                                                                                                                                     The cost sharing for the project will be sixteen percent of                     the NSF portion.",
