 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conservation is only a nascent concern in regions with small               populations and minimal economic development.  Studies of                       emerging conservation movements in these regions have not                       determined whether these movements have indigenous roots or                     whether they are responses to outside stimulation.  Little also                 is known about the ways traditional values and attitudes                        contribute to their establishment, growth, and form.  This                      doctoral dissertation project will study a fledgling conservation               movement in Quintana Roo, Mexico, which until about thirty years                ago was a virtually undeveloped territory of low population                     density and rich natural diversity.  Participant observation,                   interviews, and histories of conservation groups will be used to                illuminate the nature of local conservation activities that have                been carried out in the wake of rapidly increasing tourism,                     agricultural activity, and immigration in the state.                                                                                                                 This project will provide valuable information about the                   origins, progress, and factors that shape conservation movements,               and it could shed light on the changing roles of humans as                      protectors and manipulators of their environments.  This project                also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young                scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.",
