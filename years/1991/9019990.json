 "awd_abstract_narration": "The observed changes and evolution of natural populations                  are closely influenced by the life history of the organisms                     involved, and their responses to environmental change.                          Environments can drive temporal changes in the rates of vital                   events such as birth, death and growth.  They can also result in                resource limitations that reveal themselves in density-dependent                population responses.   This proposal aims to explore the                       consequences of both of these kinds of environmental effects for                dynamics and evolution.  One direction of study is the analysis                 of changing environments as they affect the rate at which                       organisms develop, and the distribution of reproduction over the                lifespan of organisms, with special attention to repeated                       reproduction and developmental delays.  This will be the first                  systematic analysis of the effect of environmental pattern on the               evolution of complex life cycles, and will also explore the                     relationship between population growth and the components of                    the life cycle, when the environment is changing unpredictably                  over time.                                                                           A second direction of study focuses on resource limitation                 and density effects in shaping the dynamics of population change;               in particular, the ways in which such effects can drive cyclical                change in population numbers and composition.  These effects have               been studied in experimental populations, and the theory will be                applied to these data.",
