 "awd_abstract_narration": "At a general level, it is natural to expect that risks and                      rewards in the economy's production processes should vary over                  the course of economic fluctuations, and that asset returns                     should mirror this variation.  However, the mechanism by which                  asset returns are linked to economic fluctuations is not yet well               understood.  The contribution of this project comes from                        developing empirically successful economic models of the links                  between asset returns and economic fluctuations.  Such models are               important because: 1) they will help discriminate between                       competing theories of business cycles; 2) they are one of the                   only ways of rigorously determining whether or not volatility in                financial markets indicate speculative fads or the response of                  efficient markets to changes in fundamentals; and 3) successful                 economic models could improve portfolio allocation rules.                                                                                                       The first part of this project extends a production-based asset                 pricing model, that is a model of the physical rates of return of               production processes in the economy.  The extension covers                      empirical tests of simultaneous variations in the returns on many               different assets using several different techniques and cross-                  sectional data of asset prices; improvements in the description                 of technology; and the explicit study of time aggregation.  The                 second part of the project involves the calculation of the                      variation in conditional moments of discount factors implied by                 variation in the conditional moments of asset returns.  The                     results are used to determine whether or not the behavior of                    asset returns is due to \"fads\" or to rational movements in                      discount factors.",
