 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Electrical Communications Laboratory facilities at the                      University of Texas at San Antonio are being upgraded to extend                 and cover the traditional as well as new base technologies,                     such as fiber optics, satellite communications, high definition                 television, and digital audio recording.  Three levels of                       experimentation are used.  Initially, experiments dealing with                  the design of basic building blocks of analog and digital                       communications systems are investigated to provide familiarity                  with various signal processing techniques used in modern                        communications systems, instruction on how to operate                           communication laboratory test equipment such as spectrum and                    modulation domain analyzers, and exposure to some                               hardware/software implementation.  The second level of                          experimentation involves small system design in which discrete                  or integrated devices are used to build small systems.  Level                   three involves experimentation with a complete communications                   system such as a fiber optics network or a simulated satellite                  link like \"MODEM\"  which can simulate an entire digital                         communications system and provide performance information                       similar to laboratory observations.",
