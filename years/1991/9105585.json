 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the proposed study are 1) to identify genes that                   contribute to cell differentiation and formation of the body plan               during embryogenesis of the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio, and 2)                to characterize when and where in the embryo cell or region                     specific gene expression originates. To examine gene function                   during development, Dr. Grunwald will generate transgenic                       zebrafish that harbor promoter-less lacZ reporter genes                         integrated at random locations in the genome. Expression of the                 reporter gene will necessarily be derived from endogenous                       transcriptional promoters. Patterns of gene expression that                     signal early embryonic differentiation events will be recognized                by virtue of the expression of the lacZ transgene. Developmental                mutation that arise from disruption of host genes and that                      disturb the normal structure of the one day embryo will be                      recognized using simple anatomical and behavioral screens. The                  developmental mutations and their associated phenotypes will be                 characterized in detail. Mutations of interest will be                          molecularly isolated and analyzed. To characterize in detail the                ontogeny of the earliest tissues that arise during zebrafish                    embryogenesis, Dr. Grunwald will examine the expression of well                 defined tissue specific genes. Analysis of the expression of Vg1                will contribute to an understanding of the maternal contribution                to development in animals with pluripotent blastomeres.                         Establishing when and where tissue specific gene expression                     originates will help clarify the relation between cell movements                at gastrulation and the induction of tissue differentiation, and                will be a critical first step toward developing experimentally                  testable hypotheses regarding the forces that promote tissue                    differentiation in the zebrafish embryo.",
