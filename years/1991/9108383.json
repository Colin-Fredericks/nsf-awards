 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                   anthropologist from Rutgers University studying the indigenous                  Negrito people of the Andaman Islands, India.  These islands were               the site of some important ethnographic research on hunter-                     gatherers in the early part of this century, and have not been                  restudied in recent times.  This project traces the history of                  the Indian state's administration of the indigenous societies,                  the history of resettlement of mainlanders, and the diminution of               the native populations.  Methods involve participant observation,               in-depth life history interviews,  and the study of local                       government archives.                                                                                                                                            This project is important because the declining population and                  immense health and social problems of local indigenous peoples                  caused by their interaction with national states has been a                     recurring tragedy.  This case study of a group studied several                  generations ago will add valuable material that can help policy                 makers understand the impact of state involvement with native                   peoples, and hopefully ameliorate the negative impact of the                    interaction.",
