 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this three year project is to provide each                          isolated school district of Hawaii with teachers who are                        capable of supporting the teaching of hands-on inquiry based                    physical science units.  Resource Teachers, who are high                        school teachers with excellent science backgrounds and an                       interest in working with young children, will be identified.                    They will be educated over a two year period on how young                       children learn science and the new curricular materials that                    are available to support instruction.  During two consultive                    summers these Resource Teachers, supported by the project                       staff, will conduct five weeks of inservice training with                       elementary school teachers who have been identified as leaders                  in their schools.  They will also support these teachers as                     they practice the new methodology in special summer science                     camp settings.  During the school year these elementary Lead                    Teachers, with support from the Resource Teachers, will                         practice the new units of instruction.  In the second and                       third year of the grant, supported by the Resource Teachers,                    the Lead Teachers will teach their colleagues about the new                     units.  As a result, by the end of the grant period, each                       cluster of schools will contain one high school science                         teacher who can function as a Resource Teacher for all of the                   elementary school teachers in the district and two Lead                         Teachers per building who can provide special support for the                   other elementary school teachers in their building.                                                                                                             The cost sharing will be 38% of the NSF portion.",
