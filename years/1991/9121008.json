 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth's deep interior remains a major scientific frontier that              holds the key to understanding the origin of the planet, its                    evolution through geologic time to the present structure, and the               internal causes of plate dynamics, earthquakes, volcanism, and the              geomagnetic field. Inaccessible to direct observation below a few               kilometers (the limit of drilling and exposure by erosion) the                  Earth's crust, mantle, and core are primarily studied through their             interaction with seismic waves. Recent developments in seismic                  sensor design, digital data acquisition, transmission, and storage              techniques make possible dramatic improvements in the resolving                 power of seismic imaging methods.                                                                                                                               The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology, or the IRIS              Consortium, is composed of 70 U.S. universities with research and               teaching programs in seismology. It serves as a national facility               for the development, deployment, and support of modern digital                  seismic instrumentation, and its mission is organized into three                major program elements: (1) The Global Seismographic Network (GSN)              program provides the U.S. contribution to an international network              of 128 permanent, standardized, very-broad-band (VBB), wide dynamic             range digital seismic stations at a spacing of approximately 2000               km around the globe. (2) The Program for Array  Seismic Studies of              the Continental Lithosphere (PASSCAL) aims to establish a U.S.                  national resource of 600 portable seismometer systems available for             field deployment in specific seismic imaging experiments and for                rapid response to earthquake studies. (3) The IRIS Data Management              System (DMS) aims to provide the national and international seismic             research community with timely access to data from the GSN and                  PASSCAL programs. It archives and distributes the data from these               programs and facilitates the standardization and exchange of data.                                                                                              During its initial five years of operation from 1986 to 1990, the               IRIS Consortium accomplished the following specific tasks: (1) It               developed the IRIS-1 and IRIS-2 lines of standardized permanent                 station instrumentation employing VBB sensor technology for the                 GSN. Two IRIS operations and maintenance facilities for the GSN                 were installed at the U.S. Geological Survey's Albuquerque                      Seismological Laboratory and at the University of California, San               Diego. Currently, 25 GSN VBB stations have been installed world-                wide and are returning data. (2) The PASSCAL program has developed              two lines of standardized portable seismographic instrument                     packages. One hundred of these  are currently housed at the first               PASSCAL Instrument Center, located at the Lamont-Doherty Geological             Observatory. PASSCAL instruments have already been used in a number             of planned field experiments, and were rapidly deployed for                     aftershock studies of the 1987 Armenia and 1989 Loma Prieta,                    California earthquakes. (3) The DMS has established GSN data                    collection nodes at the Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory and                at the University of California, San Diego. An IRIS central data                archive and distribution center is temporarily operating at the                 Center for High Performance Computing at the University of Texas.               Through Internet, U.S. users (and European users via the ORFEUS                 data center in the Netherlands) have access to the continuous data              streams from most of the existing GSN stations, to major-event                  waveform data in near-real time, and to special datasets from                   important earthquakes as well as from PASSCAL field experiments.                                                                                                This award provides FY-1991 funding for the participation of the                U.S. Geological Survey's Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory in                establishing the IRIS Global Seismographic Network and for related              data management activities.",
