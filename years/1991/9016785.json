 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for a two year cooperative                      research project on protogiant planet formation, between                        Professor Peter H Bodenheimer and colleagues at the Lick                        Observatory, University of California, Santa Cruz, and                          Professor Satoru Ikeuchi and colleagues from the National                       Astronomical Observatory, Japan.  The formation of the solar                    system is one of the most important unsolved problems in                        astrophysics and planetary science.  Recently accumulated                       observational data on the existence and evolution of                            protostellar disks around young stars seem to indicate that                     systems, similar to those that lead to the formation of the                     solar system, may be abundant, and that the formation of                        planetary systems may be an ongoing process instead of a                        long-ago event.  The aim of this project is to is to undertake                  a theoretical investigation of the formation of giant planets                   to help interpret these observations.  Giant planets are                        thought to have been initiated by the accumulation of small                     solid particles that existed in the primordial solar nebula.                    After the build up of this core to a few earth masses, it is                    believed that the protoplanet was able to gravitationally                       capture relatively large amounts of gas from the nebula, and                    that the final formation stages were dominated by gas                           accretion.  It is intended during this project to analyze                       this process of gas accretion, using a three-dimensional                        hydrodynamic computer code. Through this analysis, it is                        hoped to determine the mass accretion rate as a function of                     time, the rate of accretion of spin angular momentum as a                       function of time, and the change in the location of the                         protoplanetary orbit as a function of time.                                                                                                                     Both the US and Japanese researchers involved in this                           collaboration have made intensive investigations into the                       general problem of the origin of the solar system and are                       highly regarded for their past research in the subject area.                    The research skills of the two groups are very complementary.                   If the research is successful it should give us some insight                    into how the final mass of giant planets was determined and                     how the regular satellite systems originated, and should                        provide a very valuable theoretical component to our                            understanding of the process of planet and solar system                         formation.",
