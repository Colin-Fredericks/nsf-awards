 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will be                       supported by this award.  Ten students will work on problems of                 mathematical analysis under the direction of two faculty                        advisors.  The principal investigator and the visiting faculty                  member were both heavily involved with the REU program conducted                                                                                                last year at TSU.  Again too, there will be joint activities with                                                                                               the University of Houston.  Included will be a weekly visit to                  the UH campus to access the facilities of the Nonlinear Dynamics                                                                                                Laboratory.  In addition, a Careers Day and panel discussion                    will be repeated.  Visitors from the surrounding community such                 as Exxon and the Johnson Space Center as well as other academic                 institutions will meet with students to discuss career                          opportunities.                                                                                                                                                  The research will focus on two primary topics.  These are                       oscillation theory of ordinary differential equations and                       iterating of mappings and chaos, sometimes referred to as                       discrete dynamical systems.  These topics are particularly good;                                                                                                one can involve students almost immediately with important and                  intelligible problems with a strong geometric flavor.                                                                                                           Students will be encouraged to prepare reports on their                         accomplishments and present them at professional meetings.  In                  particular, they will be invited to attend the annual meeting of                                                                                                the Research Association of Minority Professors held each year in                                                                                               Houston.",
