 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad objective of this research is to characterize utilization             of early successional habitats by a non-human primate community in              West Africa.  Specifically, the proposed research will examine the              relationship between primate utilization of early successional                  plots and potentially influential components of the habitat such                as vegetation phenology patterns, availability and quality of fruit             resources in young vs. older secondary forest; distribution of                  large residual trees within clearings; and distance categories from             forest edge.  Data collection will be accomplished by systematic                surveys of primate utilization patterns along with vegetation                   phenology surveys, collection of fruits from fruit traps, and                   analysis of the constituents (nutrient content and digestibility                reducers) and morphology (color and size) of available fruits.                  Particular attention will be directed toward the identification of              keystone resources occurring within early successional habitats.                The field study will be conducted at Tiwai, Sierra Leone. Tiwai,                Sierra Leone.  A site with a high diversity (11 species) and                    density of primates, along with a high degree of habitat                        heterogeneity.  Fruit and data analysis will follow at Rutgers                  University.",
