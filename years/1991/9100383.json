 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School of Mathematics was formed in 1930 at the founding               of the Institute for Advanced Study, and many mathematical                      institutes founded both in the United States and abroad in the                  intervening decades were inspired by a desire to emulate the School             and its achievements.  The original purpose of the Institute was to             provide an environment exceptionally favorable for research by                  freeing scholars from teaching duties and by offering total freedom             in research plans and objectives.  More recently, a new goal of the             Institute has been to provide a post doctoral education for junior              Ph.D.'s.                                                                             Although the School of Mathematics, as a part of the                       Institute, has a substantial endowment which is adequate for the                permanent faculty and the maintenance of an exceptionally agreeable             working environment, it does not suffice to support all the                     temporary members.  This grant will provide support to allow about              26 junior mathematicians to spend a year at the School of                       Mathematics.",
