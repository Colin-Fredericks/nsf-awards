 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pulling on objects in the world (e.g., opening a door) is a                common activity of daily living that requires people to use their               arms effectively, often while maintaining a standing posture.                   Such actions, which are readily performed by adults are                         deceptively simple.  Pulls made while standing actually require a               complex and precise coordination of many muscles and body segment               motions for the person to achieve the focal goal of pulling, and                still maintain balance.  Research has shown that postural                       adjustments (body motions and muscle activity) accompany pulling                movements made by free-standing individuals.  However, neither                  the precise function of these postural movements nor the neural                 processes by which they are coordinated with arm movements are                  very well understood.  This research program will shed light on                 how postural adjustments are coordinated with arm movements.  The               studies will systematically vary the amount of physical support                 and expectancy factors.  The effect of these factors on body                    motion and balance, on pulling forces, and on muscle activity in                the arms and legs will yield new insights into the functional and               neural processes which coordinate postural adjustments with                     voluntary pulling movements.  This resezrch will contribute                     significantly to fundamental knowledge about the control of                     posture and movement.",
