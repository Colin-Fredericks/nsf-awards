 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuation of a project to develop and operate air                  Cherenkov telescopes at South Pole Station for the purpose of                   studying discreet astrophysical sources of very high energy (VHE)               gamma rays.  The project is called Gammas At South Pole (GASP), and             this second phase is GASP II.  The primary instrument consists of               an array of parabolic mirrors, with photomultiplier tubes at their              foci, which can detect light from VHE interactions in a small                   volume of the atmosphere.  The experiment will shed light on the                origin of cosmic rays and possibly on sources of exotic radiation,              if such radiation exists.                                                                                                                                       GASP complements the pre-existing South Pole Air Shower Experiment              (SPASE), which is operated by the Bartol Research Institute of the              University of Delaware and Leeds University (UK), and extends                   downward by two to three orders of magnitude the energy threshold               of SPASE.  SPASE can survey most of the southern sky, and GASP will             be able to focus on small regions of suspected activity.                                                                                                        The location at South Pole allows GASP to view a single object for              extended periods (weeks to months) through a constant thickness of              atmosphere, while mid-latitude locations allow only a few hours of              viewing at a time of a given object.  The Polar location also means             that the very interesting high declination southern sky is always               within view, which gives GASP a great advantage over any mid-                   latitude observatory.                                                                                                                                           The project is a collaboration of the University of Wisconsin,                  Purdue University, Bartol Research Institute of the University of               Delaware and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.  It is jointly              funded by NSF's Divisions of Polar Programs, the Wisconsin Alumni               Research Foundation and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.",
