 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus upon the structure, function and                        genetics of protein and RNA components of the prokaryotic                       ribosome.  (1) The structural features within E. coli 16S and                   23S rRNAs that account for their specific interaction with r-                   proteins S8 and L1 during ribosome assembly will be probed by                   site-directed mutagenesis and protein-rRNA cross-linking.  In                   addition, the minimum rRNA segment required for protein                         binding will be determined to facilitate their detailed                         physical characterization in the future.  (2) Over 40 mutants                   of E. coli r-protein S8 have been isolated on the basis of                      their inability to translationally regulate spc operon                          expression. The metabolic and physically stability of these                     proteins will be examined, and their RNA-binding properties                     evaluated.  2D NMR analysis of wild-type and mutants S8 will                    be used to define the structure of S8, and its RNA-binding                      domain, at high resolution.  (3) Operons encoding components                    of the translation and transcription apparatus in several                       thermoacidophilic archaebacteria will be isolated and                           sequenced.  Various approaches will be employed to gain                         insights into how the expression of these transcription units                   is controlled.  The results will provide a better                               understanding of the evolution of gene regulation, as well as                   of gene organization, in this unusual group of organisms.",
