 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a two year cooperative                          research project between Professor Joachim Burgdorfer and                       Professor Stuart B Elston, Department of Physics and Astronomy,                 University of Tennessee, and the Quantum Physics Group at the                   Department of Engineering, Kyoto University, Japan, led by                      Professor Michi-hiko Mannami.  The purpose of the project is                    to undertake a collaborative theoretical and experimental                       study of the collision interactions of fast charged particles                   with valence electrons near surfaces.  Scattering from clean                    well defined surfaces at glancing angles provides the                           opportunity to study collision processes at large impact                        parameters, thereby accentuating interactions with valence                      electrons in the proximity of the surface while suppressing                     contributions from ionic cores.  The project will involve                       firstly a theoretical and experimental investigation of the                     energy and angular distributions of convoy electrons ejected                    in glancing angle ion-surface collisions as a function of                       projectile charge state and velocity, and surface structure                     and composition.  Secondly a computer simulation of the                         reflection of scattered ions will be developed, with particular                 emphasis on the simultaneous evolution of electron projectile                   states and the dynamical response of the valence electron.                      Finally a theoretical and experimental investigation of the                     yield and angular distribution of convoy electrons produced                     by channeled fast ions will be carried out.                                                                                                                     There is strong overlap between the work of the groups at                       Kyoto University and the University of Tennessee, with                          complementing capabilities in both theory and experiment.                       The group in the US, for example, have extensive numerical                      experience in Monte-Carlo simulations for electronic transport                  in solids, where as the Kyoto group have developed a simulation                 code for ionic scattering from solid surfaces.  This project                    should provide detailed new information on the contribution                     of delocalized electrons to excitation processes, on the                        collective response of conduction electrons and its influence                   on secondary electron emission and, more broadly, on the                        usefulness of inelastic collision processes as a tool of                        surface diagnostics.",
