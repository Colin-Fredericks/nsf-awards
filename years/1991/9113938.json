 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic                       environment and its role in global change which is promoted                     by NSF's Arctic System Science Program.  It is a two year                       study to investigate the effect of heat input into the                          atmosphere produced from relatively warm water exposed by a                     break in polar ice.  The study will use a large-eddy                            atmospheric model.  This model explicitly simulates the                         convective turbulent eddies that such inhomogeneous heating                     creates and does not rely on assumptions of horizontal                          homogeneity.  This simulation seeks to bridge the gap                           between air-sea-ice coupled models and large-scale primitive                    equation models, neither of which can accurately model the                      turbulent transfer on such time and space scales.  The heat                     transferred upwards from the water will be analyzed to                          determine the amount which is recaptured by ice and the                         amount and location of that retained by the atmosphere.",
