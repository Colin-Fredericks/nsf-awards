 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Griffiths, Caldwell, Baham and Cromack have shown that certain             specialized ectomycorrhizal species of Gautieria and Hysterangium               form extensive hyphal or rhizomorph mat structures that are                     significant features of temperate coniferous forests.  In                       comparison with soils without obvious mat development, both types               of mats have elevated pore-water concentrations of dissolved                    organic carbon, fluoride, oxalate, and sulfate, as well as major                and trace metal cations, including Al and Fe which can be                       responsible for controlling the solubility of both organic and                  inorganic phosphorus.  In Hysterangium mats, most of the oxalate                was present in the solid phase, presumably as calcium oxalate,                  while in Gautieria mats, a relatively larger fraction of oxalate                was in solution at concentrations that approached those used in                 organic matter extractions of soils.                                                                                                                            While long implicated in mineral dissolution, the ligand properties             of oxalate also suggest other significant roles in forest soil                  processes.  Drs. Griffiths, Caldwell, Baham and Cromack will use                these mat communities to investigate the role of oxalate species                and other major organic ligands in mineral weathering, solution and             solid phase soil chemistry, Al and Fe activity, and the processing              of organic nitrogen and phosphorus by soil enzymes in diverse                   forest ecotypes.  Results from field studies and laboratory                     experiments will be used as input to a quasi-steady-state model of              soil solution and solid phase biogeochemistry.  This model will                 provide insight into actual mechanisms controlling nutrient cycling             in forest ecosystems.  These researchers are experts in the area                of forest soil biogeochemistry.  The facilities available for this              research are outstanding.",
