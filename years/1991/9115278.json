 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of large metal clusters containing gold and silver                     will be synthesized and structurally characterized.  This                       series follows a well-defined growth sequence based on vertex-                  sharing, a feature that will be extended in this project.  The                  effect of changes in (typically) phosphine and halide ligands                   on the stereochemistry of the clusters will be systematically                   studied.  Clusters of high nuclearity but containing metal                      combinations such as Pt-Au, Pt-Au-Ag, Pd-Au, and Pd-Au-Ag will                  be prepared by synthetic routes analogous to those developed                    for the Au-Ag system.  Synchroton or rotating anode X-ray                       crystallography will be used for the structural determinations                  of the large clusters.  Since these clusters will be                            intermediate in size between individual atoms and extended                      lattices, it is possible that the results of these studies may                  be relevant to the nucleation and growth of fine particles,                     quasi-crystals, and amorphous materials.                                        %%%                                                                             In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                     metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Boon K. Teo                     will synthesize, structurally characterize, and study the                       growth systematics of large clusters containing up to seventy-                  five metal atoms.  These species are near the interface between                 large clusters and colloids, where interesting new materials                    having potential applications as electronic and magnetic                        materials and as catalysts may be anticipated.",
