 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an 18 month program that includes 1) a 1991                     summer institute for 32 high school biology teachers with two                   academic year follow-up sessions, and 2) a pilot leadership                     program consisting of five two-week workshops taught, during                    the summer of 1992, by teams of lead teachers selected from                     previous institutes. The institute and follow-up sessions will                  be held on the campus of Indiana University and the workshops                   will be held in five different local sites, yet to be                           selected.  The workshops will serve an additional 100                           teachers.                                                                                                                                                       The purpose of this program, which builds upon the success of                   a previous teacher enhancement effort, is to develop a                          leadership program that can serve as a national model for                       dissemination of knowledge and pedagogical techniques in a                      specific subject matter area. The objectives of this program                    are 1) to improve the quality of instruction of the nature of                   science and evolution; 2) to encourage and enable biology                       teachers to begin with these matters and to integrate them                      throughout the biology course; 3) to demonstrate how the use                    of humans as biological examples can enhance student interest                   and learning; 4) to assist teachers in developing a more                        dynamic teaching methodology.                                                                                                                                   Applications sessions will emphasize a shift in laboratory                      focus toward exploratory activities.  In addition the use of                    cooperative learning, concept mapping, and textbooks as                         reference sources will be encouraged.                                                                                                                           An amount equal to 28% of NSF costs will be provided as cost                    sharing.",
