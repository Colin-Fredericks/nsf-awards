 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past five years, UT Arlington's Department of Electrical             Engineering has conducted an experimental program involving                     undergraduate scholars in research projects.  This program builds on the        past experience.  Specifically, this current program is strengthened by         increasing the funding, raising the number of students to eight,                providing research opportunities during summers, and emphasizing                recruitment of underrepresented US citizens and permanent residents in          electrical engineering.  The philosophy of the program is the                   integration of undergraduate scholars into existing research projects           and the significant interaction between faculty and students.  The              scholars are encouraged to be creative and productive and are expected          to gain considerable independence during two consecutive academic               semesters.  A full-time summer research opportunity is then available           with significant research contributions possible.",
