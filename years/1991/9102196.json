 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds for instrumentation needed for the                    further development and assessment of parallel distributed                      processing (PDP) models of a number of different aspects of human               cognitive processes.  We seek to study a class of PDP models in                 which processing occurs through the interaction of a large number               of intrinsically variable processing units whose activation is                  based on a time-average of their input from other units.  The                   knowledge that governs skilled processing is stored in the                      strengths of the connections among the units, and the acquisition               of the knowledge that underlies skilled processing occurs through               gradual adjustments in the strengths of the connections triggered               by processing experience.  Previous work has shown the potential                of the approach for a number of applications, but continued                     progress requires an increase in computational resources.  In                   some cases, it has not been possible to explore a realistically                 diverse range of training examples, thus limiting the opportunity               to test the adequacy of the principles to model human performance               data.  In other cases, simplified assumptions about processing                  have been made, and it is now clear that these simplifications                  can result in inadequate fits to experimental data.  In both                    kinds of cases, the ability to assess the degree to which the                   models can account for experimental data has been compromised.                  We therefore seek an upgrade to our existing 5-year old                         vectorizing 'minisupercomputer' to a newer, more powerful model.",
