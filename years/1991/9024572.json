 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hypogeous fungi (truffles and false truffles) are ideal organisms               for studying the relationships of fungi and their plant hosts.                  These fungi form obligate, ectomycorrhizal associations with trees              and are also dependent on rodents for spore dispersal.  The Great               Basin is an ideal setting for such studies because hypogeous fungi              are found in widely scattered forest \"islands\" separated by                     inhospitable desert lacking appropriate ectomycorrhizal hosts to                serve as \"stepping-stones\" for dispersal between islands.  A survey             on hypogeous fungi on forest islands in the Great Basin, an area                of 714,854 sq. km., is proposed to supplement the 1500 collections,             virtually, the only collections from most of the Great Basin, that              have been amassed from limited collecting in the area.  Data from               the collections will be used to expand an existing database,                    produce a hypogeous mycoflora of the region, and test several                   theories of biogeography and evolutionary biology.  In addition,                information from the specimens will be valuable in selecting fungi              for artificial inoculation of tree seedlings for reforestation in               the Great Basin.  The data will also be useful to wildlife managers             interested in the dietary items available to small mammals.  The                specimens themselves will provide DNA for testing phylogenetic                  relationships, factors controlling macrospeciation, and the genetic             structure of isolated populations of hypogeous fungi.",
