 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to develop, evaluate, and                     publicize a curriculum in quantitative studies for                              undergraduates in the life sciences. This curriculum will                       emphasize the great utility of quantitative approaches in                       analyzing biological problems, will utilize many examples from                  recent biological research, and serve a dual role of both                       introducing new quantitative methods and reinforcing key                        concepts in modem biology. A variety of software will be                        evaluated and utilized in the curriculum to enhance the                         problem-solving aspects of the courses. This will enable                        students to experiment with alternative key biological                          assumptions in mathematical models and analyze the resultant                    quantitative and qualitative behavior of these assumptions. The                 curriculum to be developed will include an entry-level sequence                 as well as a second-year set of courses. A workshop of                          researchers and educators in quantitative biology will be held                  as part of the initial stages of the development in order to                    develop a set of basic quantitative and biological concepts                     that should be included in the curriculum. A few of the                         attendees at this workshop will serve as an advisory board for                  the remainder of the projected proposal period. Over the three                  years of the proposal, the new curriculum will be developed,                    appropriate software evaluated, pilot studies run, and results                  of the project publicized. A monograph compiling detailed                       syllabi, lesson plans, and software evaluations will be                         published and distributed to quantitative and life science                      departments throughout the U.S.",
