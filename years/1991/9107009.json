Project funding                   will allow a highly qualified researcher from Egypt to spend one                year in the laboratory of Dr. M. Hanif Chaudhry at Washington                   State University.  The collaborative research will investigate                  experimentally and theoretically the modelling of unsteady flows.               Computer models are expected to analyze these flows accurately                  for the design and operation of various flow-conveyance                         structures.                                                                                                                                                     This project in water resources engineering fulfills the program                objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                 experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary                 talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                   interest and competence.",
