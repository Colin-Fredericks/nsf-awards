A novel portion of the work will seek to adjust the                 nature of reaction products by exciting reagents near the                       electrodes with ultraviolet light.  In addition, some                           measurements of atomic-scale structure will be made using                       Scanning Tunneling Microscopy.                                                                                                                                  %%%                                                                                                                                                             This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                          Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will study several                 topics in organic electrochemistry.  Series of compounds will                   be investigated so that the transition from SN1 to SN2                          mechanisms as structure varies can be predicted.  In turn, this                 will allow prediction of stereoselectivity in                                   electrochemically-generated organic species.  Photochemical                     excitation prior to electrochemistry will be investigated as a                  means of varying product makeup.  Finally, adsorption on                        electrodes will be studied with Scanning Tunneling Microscopy,                  as a means to independently characterize adsorption on                          electrode surfaces.",
