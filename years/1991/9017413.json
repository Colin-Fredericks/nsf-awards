 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Vertebrate Paleontology collection at the Texas Memorial               Museum, University of Texas, includes 150,000 catalogued                        specimens, 156 types and vouchers, and is one of the most                       valuable research collections of its kind in the U.S.  The                      collection's strengths are in the diverse Texas Mesozoic fauna,                 Devonian fishes, and Tertiary mammals of the south and southwest.               Dr. Ernest Lundelius, Director of the Vertebrate Paleontology and               Radiocarbon Laboratory in the Texas Memorial Museum, has devised                a three-year plan for continued improvement to the collection.                  This phase would include installation of new specimen storage                   cabinets, new storage racks for very large specimens, and would                 replace the outdated computer equipment that currently hampers                  the database operations.  Curatorial projects would continue to                 improve the availability of specimens and the accuracy and                      accessibility of specimen-related data.                                              The proposed collection improvement will have significant                  impact on the paleontological research community.  The vertebrate               fossils in the Texas Memorial Museum are heavily used by research               paleontologists in studies of evolution, paleoecology, and global               change.  Improving the accessibility of these collections will                  benefit generations of research scientists.",
