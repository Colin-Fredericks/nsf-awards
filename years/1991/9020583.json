 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will gain insights into carbon balances in peatlands              and measure gaseous exchanges of carbon between peatlands and the               atmosphere.  Drs. Wieder and Yavitt will use a series of                        descriptive and experimental field and laboratory studies to                    evaluate historical development and present function of peatland                ecosystems.  This research will focus on comparisons between                    Sphagnum-dominated peatlands that have developed over thousands of              years in relatively warmer climates (southern peatlands in the                  Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia) and Sphagnum-dominated                  peatlands that developed in cooler regions.                                                                                                                     Specific research objectives are: to characterize changes in                    chemical nature of organic matter during long-term peat                         accumulation, to determine the relative importance of methane                   production versus sulfate reduction in peatlands subjected to                   differing atmospheric sulfur depositions, to quantify transfers of              photosynthetically fixed 14CO2 within a northern and southern                   peatland, to experimentally evaluate effects of biotic versus                   abiotic factors on the transfer of photosynthetically fixed 14CO2,              and to evaluate the effects of temperature and water table level                on gaseous carbon fluxes from peatlands to the atmosphere.                      Information obtained from this research will improve our ability                to predict possible changes in peatland ecosystem function,                     particularly with regard to carbon balance, peat                                accumulation/degradation, and exchange of carbon gases with the                 atmosphere under various projections of global climate change. Drs.             Wieder and Yavitt are leading peatland researchers.  The facilities             available for this research are outstanding.",
