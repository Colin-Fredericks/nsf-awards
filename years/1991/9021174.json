 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reliability and Quality are closely related concepts dealing               with improvement of product quality.  In this age of high-tech                  industry, the development of technology to ensure consistent                    performance, quality and reliability of materials are of                        considerable interest.  Because of the magnitude of the                         expenditures involved and the pressure to make early decisions                  correctly, it has been necessary to devise suitable statistical                 techniques that would enable the experimenter to make valid                     statistical decisions even before the experiment is terminated.                 Thus reliability and quality have proven to be areas of research                related to national need.                                                            This grant will partially support a conference on Reliability              at the University of Missouri in June, 1991.  Participants will                 include representatives from the academic, the industrial and the               governmental spheres.  The interaction of these engineers and                   statisticians should prove to be beneficial for future development              of much needed process improvements methodology.",
