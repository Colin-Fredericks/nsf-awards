 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Princeton University School of engineering and Applied                    Science proposes to establish and RCMS Program, Princeton                       Research Opportunities for Minority Engineering Students                        (PROMES), as a key part of a comprehensive  effort to enhance                   the recruitment and retention o minority undergraduate                          students and to provide assistance and encouragement for the                    students to pursue careers in engineering and applied science.                      The PROMES Program will focus on increasing the number of                   students who prepare for graduate study in engineering, and                     also on encouraging both higher academic interest and                           achievement among participating minority students.                              Princeton will expand its academic advising and support                         services to provide for academic enrichment and career                          motivation.  These activities will serve a broad cross-section                  of Freshman engineering students.  In addition, Princeton                       will select thirty students (five cohorts) as PROMES Fellows                    over the 5 year course of the program, and match them with                      individual faculty mentors beginning within the Sophomore year                  when they have chosen a major department.  The program will                     build on the strongest elements of the Princeton undergraduate                  experience:  faculty supervision of undergraduate independent                   work; comfortable settings in which dialogue between faculty                    and students as well as among students themselves can easily                    take place and in which students can participate to the                         fullest extent; exchange among graduate and undergraduate                       students in an excellent research enterprise; and close                         advising, mentoring, and encouragement of high academic                         achievement.",
