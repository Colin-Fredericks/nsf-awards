 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the first phase of this NSF sponsored Small Business                     Innovation Research project, Giner, Inc. demonstrated increased                 corrosion resistance of uniformly deposited, boron-doped conductive             diamond coatings on graphite substrates (fuel cell bipolar                      separator plate materials) and a reduction in acid absorption (in               a phosphoric acid fuel cell environment) as compared to the                     uncoated or non-uniformly coated graphite.                                                                                                                      Very little is known regarding the relationship between growth                  initiation conditions on the substrate and the resulting                        microstructure of thin diamond coatings, and the adherence of the               coatings to substrates. Hence, the research plan for Phase II                   focuses on: (1) effect of pretreatment process of nucleating                    surfaces (graphite and silicon) on nucleation density and on the                nature and properties of the transition layer; (2) growth                       experiments for determining the variables that affect the                       microstructure of the diamond films; (3) determination of corrosion             behavior and correlation with phase purity and crystallite size;                (4) development of a process model to describe the parameters and               relationships that control: (i) the formation of reproducible dense             and corrosion-resistant, very thin boron-doped diamond films; and               (ii) the properties of the transition layer interfaces between the              films and the substrates. The diamond coating process will be done              by another small business firm, Epion Corporation, under the                    guidance of Giner, Inc.                                                                                                                                         It is expected the knowledge gained from this research will                     facilitate the development of advanced electrochemical cells and                constitute an important contribution to diamond films technology.",
