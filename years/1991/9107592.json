Lyapunov exponents of random                           differential equations characterize the exponential divergence of               solutions to such equations.  The research involves several                     fields of mathematics: probability, differential equations,                     control theory and ergodic theory, and is relevant to applied                   engineering problems.  The specific problems are noise dependence               of the p'th moment Lyapunov exponent, invariant probability                     measures and the Lyapunov exponents in non-Markovian situations,                stabilizing effects of noise in linear and nonlinear systems, and               by computer simulations numerics for estimating rotation numbers,               as well as pathwise and moment, Lyapunov exponents.
