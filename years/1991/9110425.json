 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design, construction and operation of facilities in extreme                 environments present difficult problem, shared among a diverse                  group of architects, engineers, scientists and managers.  Example               of efforts underway are the design of space and planetary stations,             facilities in and under water, research stations for the polar                  regions, and remote dwellings.  Although the environments are quite             different, many of the problems of supporting human life in these               environments are shared.  The exchange of experience and knowledge              among those working in this field can be valuable in addressing                 these problems.                                                                                                                                                 This grant provides partial support to a conference, the                        International Design for Extreme Environments Assembly, which will              take place at the University of Houston, November 12-15, 1991.  The             conference will provide a setting where experts from a variety of               countries and disciplines can meet to share information about                   solving practical problems, both for today and the future.",
