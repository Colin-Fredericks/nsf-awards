 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Nikolaos Peppas of Purdue                     University in a research collaboration with Professor Paolo                     Colombo of the University of Parma, Italy.  The researchers                     intend to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the                        transport and release of water soluble peptides from non-                       porous, hydrophilic polymers.  Polymer/peptide systems to be                    investigated include uncrosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol),                         poly(acrylic acid), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and                          various polymethacrylates.  Diffusion and release studies                       will be performed with calcitonin, trazodone, diclofenac,                       diltiazem and prazosin.                                                                                                                                         Controlled release systems of the swelling type are a                           promising new class of polymeric systems for release of drugs                   and biomolecules.  Although their capability to release small                   molecules at constant rates has been proven through previous                    studies, no study has been done yet for the release of high                     molecular weight (75,000) macromolecules.  Obvious applications                 of this research will be in the area of release of genetically                  engineered molecules in target areas.  The proposed work will                   provide an important understanding of the coupled phenomena                     of diffusion/swelling/dissolution and will offer guidelines                     for the development of better controlled release systems.",
