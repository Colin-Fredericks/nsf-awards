 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of the proposed project is enhancement of the                         laboratory component of our Animal Physiology course (BIOL                      342), whose student clientele comprises juniors and seniors                     majoring in biology and/or seeking to fulfill entrance                          requirements for health-professional schools. The objectives of                 this laboratory are: reinforcement of the classical                             physiological principles presented in lecture with hands-on                     experience; the practice of general, broadly applicable                         investigative skills; and the development of skill in the use                   of physiological methods and instruments. The aim of the                        project is to enhance our effectiveness in pursuing these                       objectives by exposing students to a greater variety of                         authentic investigative techniques and strategies, utilizing a                  greater variety of animal models and more sophisticated                         instrumentation. The major instruments we seek to purchase                      include oscilloscopes and digital storage modules for                           electrophysiological recordings from nerves; electrolyte and                    blood-gas analyzers for evaluation of renal and respiratory                     function; and an environmental chamber, oxygen analyzer, and                    temperature telemetry equipment for measuring metabolic                         responses to changes in temperature. We expect this project to                  intensely the interest of our students in organismal biology                    generally, to prepare them for subsequent independent                           investigative efforts, and to improve recruitment and retention                 of majors in this curricular area.",
