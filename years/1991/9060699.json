 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's             (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is               designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly             the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                 Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.               Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                   conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture             capital or other non-federal financing.                                              This is a Phase I project.  Local area networks based on the               new international ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) standard will                provide high-speed multi-media (data, audio and video)                          communication over the same network.  These networks will require               fast packet switches that can switch the very small packets                     specified by the ATM standard.  Fore Systems is researching                     interconnection of multiple fast packet switches in an arbitrary                topology to build an ATM-based local area network capable of                    supporting hundreds or thousands of attached computers.",
