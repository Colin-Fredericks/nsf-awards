The                                                    development of the model is based on                                            recent advances in Adaptive Pattern                                             Recognition (APR).  The APR                                                     predictors of the MMI forecast model                                            are to be constructed using neural                                              networks implementation through                                                 supervised learning utilizing                                                   historical earthquake and regional                                              geological data as training sets.

By                                                 combining two steps, the attenuation                                            of peak ground acceleration (PGA)                                               and the PGA-MMI conversion, into one                                            and using an optimal nonfunctional                                              and incremental model, the accuracy                                             of risk/damage analysis results are                                             improved through the reduction of                                               uncertainties, e.g., the PGA-MMI                                                conversion, and the inclusion of                                                additional site-specific independent                                            variables affecting MMI levels.                                                 The model will be applied for                                                   regional risk assessment for the                                                major metropolitan regions in                                                   California, namely the San Francisco                                            Bay and the Greater Los Angeles                                                 metropolitan areas.
