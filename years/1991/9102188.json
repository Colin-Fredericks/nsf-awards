 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reactions of singlet oxygen with sulfides, sulfenates, allyl                    stannanes, and organotellurium compounds will be studied. The                   results of this research will be three-fold: 1) An expanded                     mechanistic understanding of oxidation reactions; 2) The                        development and utilization novel oxidizing agents; and                         3) Oxidation of novel substrates that will provide new synthetic                methods for the formation of potentially useful materials. In the               course of this investigation, the effects of neighboring groups on              sulfide photooxidations will be studied, the synthesis and                      properties of persulfenic acids and hydroperoxy sufuranes will be               examined, and the ability of these new classes of oxidizing agents              to transfer oxygen to heteroatoms and unsaturated substrates will               be studied.                                                                     %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Edward Clennan at the University of                Wyoming. Molecular oxygen can be exposed to high intensity light                in the presence of a dye to generate an excited state of oxygen,                which is referred to as singlet oxygen. This excited state species              is a short-lived reactive molecule, which will oxidize various                  organic molecules. In this project, the detailed steps in the                   reaction of singlet oxygen with organic molecules will be studied.              Furthermore, the reactive intermediates that are generated in                   certain of these oxidations will be used to transfer oxygen atoms               to other organic molecules in a specific manner. This has                       potential application in the synthesis of unique molecules.",
