 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lignin degradative system (LDS) of the white rot                            basidiomycetous fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is capable of                degrading the plant cell wall polymer, lignin, and a range of                   aromatic pollutants.  The major components of this nonspecific                  oxidative system are two extracellular heme-containing peroxidases,             manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP).  The LDS                is expressed during secondary metabolic growth, the onset of which              is triggered by limiting nutrient nitrogen.  Recently, we                       discovered that MnP expression is also regulated at the level of                gene transcription by Mn ion and heat shock and the primary goal                of the proposed project is to elucidate on the molecular level the              mechanisms of Mn regulation of mnp gene transcription.  Isolation               and analysis of mutants and titration with promoter copies will be              utilized to determine the type of regulation.  The promoter regions             of P. chrysosporium mnp genes will be analyzed to determine the                 sequences responsible for Mn and heat shock regulation of                       transcription, using promoter-reporter constructs, deletion                     analysis and synthetic promoter elements.  DNaseI footprinting and              gel mobility shift assays will be used to assay putative DNA-                   binding transcription factors, and the factors will be isolated.                A possible requirement for Mn in post-transcriptional events will               be examined.",
