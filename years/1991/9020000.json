 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both C02 and 03 have profound effects on plant growth,                     physiology and biochemistry.  Given that levels of each gas are                 increasing and will continue to increase, this may result in                    substantial impact on the function and productivity of plants in                natural and agroecosystems.  Research is proposed on the                        interactive effects of elevated levels of both C02 and 03 on six                perennial canopy dominants of the forests and prairies of the                   Midwest.                                                                             The study species differ in intrinsic characteristics that                 may result in differing response to atmospheric pollutants.  The                species differ in growth form stomatal conductance and                          photosynthetic pathway.  The investigators will test the                        hypothesis that elevated levels of C02 will partially ameliorate                the deleterious effects of 03.  They will also test a number of                 other hypotheses relating growth form, stomatal conductance and                 photosynthetic pathway to pollutant response.  In general, among                all species, if there are significant interactions between 03 and               C02, rather than a strictly additive combined response, this will               suggest that the impacts of continued elevation of the                          atmospheric concentrations of these two gases on plant                          physiological behavior may be exceedingly complex and difficult                 to either predict or monitor.                                                        The results of this research will be important to our basic                understanding of the relationships of certain physiological \"life               history\" traits to a changing atmospheric environment.  In                      addition, they should help focus our national policy and research               priorities by adding to the small but growing data base                         addressing the response of natural systems to a rapidly shifting                atmospheric composition.",
