 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the ring of invariants of a set of                   generic nxn matrices over a field K, and the trace ring, which is               the noncommutative ring generated by the ring of invariants and the             generic matrices.  The fundamental problem is to find presentations             for these algebras, which would solve various explicit                          combinatorial problems.  These combinatorial problems have interest             in their own right, and currently seem more likely to be solved                 than the general problem of finding presentations.  Other questions             to be considered are whether the quotient field of C(n,r) is purely             transcendental over K and what is the structure of the variety of               representations of a group G in the trace ring.                                      The research supported concerns matrix theory, ring theory and             the calculation of invariants.  In particular, this involves an old             problem of determining what mathematical functions are preserved                under various transformations.  This is of interest in many areas               of science as well as in mathematics.",
