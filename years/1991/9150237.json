 "awd_abstract_narration": "This, three year, nationwide program provides opportunity                       for middle and high school biology teachers to spend a                          summer doing research, full-time, in a college or university                    laboratory engaged in research in cell biology.  This                           program emphasizes the identification of highly motivated                       teachers who will return to their home school and have the                      opportunity to have a continuing impact on the quality of                       science education through the design of innovative                              laboratory exercises and through the provision of in-service                    instruction for other teachers. Participating teachers will                     share classroom activities and information regarding issues                     in pedagogy and science education reform at a meeting held                      in conjunction with national NABT meetings.                                                                                                                     Emphasis will be placed on the involvement of female and                        minority teachers and on school systems that serve large                        numbers of minority students. It is expected that this                          program will have an impact on science education at the                         secondary level and have at least an indirect impact on                         career choices made by some secondary students.                                                                                                                 An amount equal to 23.1 % of NSF costs will be provided as                      cost sharing.",
