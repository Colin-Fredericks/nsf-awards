 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of the prior project on                     Process Design in Metal Forming.  A goal of research in                         manufacturing is to accomplish proper design and control of                     processes for producing required parts most economically.  One of               the most important aspects of process design in metal forming is                design of preforms and process sequence. In the prior project,                  the application of the new approach to preform design in complex                forming processes has been investigated.  The approach used                     capability of forward simulation and backward tracing of a                      forming process by the finite element method.  Significant                      accomplishments were the development of the finite element method               and implementation of the backward tracing procedure for three                  dimensional deformation processes.  The results of these                        investigations demonstrate that it is possible to design preforms               without resort to designer's experience.  In the prior project,                 the design criterion considered was a geometrical requirement for               the final product.  For process sequence design, additional                     requirements must be introduced in the design process.  Thus, the               objective of the research is to develop the methodology for                     systematic process sequence design, considering quantitatively                  requirements for material formability, defects-free metal flow                  and economic die manufacturing, in addition to the geometrical                  requirement.                                                                         Many industrial parts are formed sequentially by multiple                  dies, each of which contributes to the final shape change.  The                 project will provide analytical tools for designing the required                dies, which are now designed by trial and error, based on                       experience.",
