This building was                   constructed in 1966 and has not been renovated since that time.                 The ARFMP grant of $288,650 and $288,650 provided by the grantee                as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                    research training facilities.  This project will address the need               to improve the current research infrastructure by alleviating                   insufficiencies in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning                (HVAC) system, modifying the spatial configuration, and providing               adequate fume hoods and bench space.                                                                                                                            This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of chemical                   research and for the training of quality undergraduate students.                Trinity University is an institution with a particular commitment               to recruiting and graduating women and minorities in science and                its Department of Chemistry is experiencing significant growth in               course enrollments and in the numbers of majors who go on to                    attend graduate school.",
