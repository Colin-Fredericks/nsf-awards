The main objectives                      of the proposed research are:  (1) to produce a taxonomic                       revision of the species of Clibadium, a Neotropical genus of                    approximately 40 species distributed from Mexico to Peru;                       (2) to determine the evolutionary relationships among these                     species; (3) to establish generic limits relative to                            Desmanthodium, Ichthyothere and Stachycephalum; and (4) to                      determine biogeography and suggest modes of speciation of the                   species.  An ancillary objective of this research is to study                   variations and evolution of capitulescence structure and                        development of unusual drupe-like fruits in Clibadium for                       help in reconstructing phylogeny.  As time permits, the                         ethnobotanical activities of the Indians in Latin America                       will be documented as they relate to use of Clibadium species                   as fish-poisons.  The ethnobotanical role of the genus should                   provide an extra dimension to understanding the systematics                     and biogeography of the genus.  To achieve these goals, a                       complete collection of plant material and field observations                    along the distributional range is needed.  Morphological                        (including anatomical) and cytological data will be gathered,                   and reconstruction of phylogeny will be done by cladistic                       techniques.                                                                                                                                                     The proposed research is significant for several reasons.  It                   will produce the first modern revision of the genus, including                  keys, descriptions and a predictive classification, valuable                    to botanists working on Neotropical floras.  It will also                       provide the first phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus.                     In addition, understanding of evolutionary relationships                        within Clibadium should lead to an improved understanding of                    affinities with the related genera Desmanthodium, Ichthyothere,                 and Stachycephalum.",
