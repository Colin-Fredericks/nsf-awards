 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the aggregate consequences of the interaction              between the adjustment costs faced by individual agents and the                 transmission of information in the economy.  Adjustment costs                   provide a natural reason for information to be imperfect in a                   multi-agent economy.  When action is costly, individuals will not               find it in their interests to respond to every change in their                  circumstances, thereby preventing the transmission of individually              held information to others through market data.  In turn, the                   information problem creates a reason why, even in a competitive                 setting, equilibrium may be suboptimal.  When individuals weigh                 the costs and benefits of action, they ignore the value to others               of the information revealed by their action.  The goal of this                  study is to show that the extent of our ignorance can play a key                role in determining both the average level of business activity and             the pattern of fluctuations.                                                                                                                                    To accomplish this task many difficult modelling problems, such as              aggregation in the face of adjustment costs and the partial                     revelation of information in general equilibrium models, must be                solved.  A preliminary theoretical model which overcomes many of                the difficult modelling problems and allows a complete analysis of              the steady state interactions between information and adjustment                costs was completed.  Non-steady state extensions in which the                  importance of information dynamics is readily appreciated will be               developed.                                                                                                                                                      The idea that information may only be released through action and               that adjustment costs limit action has important consequences for               economic fluctuations.  In particular, the interaction of                       information and adjustment costs may result in the bunching of                  individual decisions.  The failure of others to act may lead all                agents to hesitate, while action by others may promote responses.               This may lead to increased market volatility.  This study takes us              down the path to a better understanding of possible causes and                  consequences of incomplete information on the behavior of the                   economy.",
