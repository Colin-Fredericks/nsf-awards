 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing innovative laboratory exercises for                  science and non-science majors involved in an interdisciplinary                 program in Environmental Studies.  Grant funds are supporting                   the purchase of an atomic absorption spectrometer with heated                   graphite furnace and a scanning spectrophotometer.  These                       instruments are key components of laboratories built around the                 examination and analysis of soils, water, and vegetation of the                 Charles River Basin in urban and suburban Boston.  Experiments                  introduce students to the nature of the scientific method with                  a non-traditional approach--the field and laboratory                            acquisition and interpretation of data, rather than the                         completion of \"demonstration\" type labs. Each experiment                        includes four components: experimental design, field                            observation and sample collection, laboratory preparation and                   analysis, and data interpretation.  Emphasis in the first year                  is on developing experiments for a two semester natural science                 sequence for non-science majors and for an Environmental                        Biology course which is one of the core courses for the                         Environmental Science major.  A laboratory manual for both                      sequences is being produced which can be used as a model for                    similar programs.  The equipment also is being used to support                  the modification of laboratory exercises and independent study                  projects for majors in Environmental Science, Biology, and                      Geology.",
