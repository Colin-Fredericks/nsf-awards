These engineering institutes, offered successively during the                   summer of 1991, will include a directed creative engineering                    design experience involving all the students as a team to find a                solution to a real-world, social-technical problem for an                       identifiable client.                                                                                                                                            The project also will include a follow-up program which involves                a mentor at each participant's high school and a number of                      activities to be completed during the 1991-92 academic year.                    This project is based on a pilot program held during the summer                 of 1990.",
