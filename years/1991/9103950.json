 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his research in Gauge             theory and explore a set of equations known as the Vortex                       equations. These equations are defined for holomorphic bundles over             Kahler manifolds and are closely related to the Hermitian-Yang-                 Mills equations. The principal investigator will study three areas              of Gauge theory in this project: Yang-Mills type functionals, the               moduli spaces associated with gauge invariant functionals, and                  properties of holomorphic vector bundles.                                            Gauge theory is a branch of geometry very closely connected                with mathematical physics. It is an area in which ideas from                    physics are serving to develop and enrich geometry and techniques               of mathematics and geometry are used to explore ideas in physics.               A number of different methods, some very analytic and others                    algebraic, are successfully being used to create a powerful and                 beautiful theory in physics. It is one of the exciting examples of              cross disciplinary research being done in mathematics today.",
