 "awd_abstract_narration": "The respiratory and circulatory systems of the body can be                 stimulated when carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions activate certain               brain cells (neurons).  These neruons are considered to be                      chemosensitive and, based on earlier studies, were thought to be                localized exclusively along one surface of the brainstem, i.e.,                 the ventrolateral medulla oblongata.  Recent evidence, however,                 now suggests that chemosensitive neurons have a wider                           distribution than previously believed and that they are also                    located in a region called the nucleus of the solitary tract.                   Both of these regions will be studied.  Chemosensitive neurons                  are thought to provide tonic input to both the cells that                       generate breathing rhythm and the cells that control vascular                   tone.  Chemosensitive cells also maintain the acid-base balance                 during periods of metabolic disturbance and changes in the                      external environment.  Despite the importance conferred on these                neurons, the exact neural pathways and cellular mechanisms by                   which they produce their effects are not known.  In the proposed                studies, electrophysiological recordings will be made from these                neurons and their responses to changes in oxygen level, acid-base               balance and drug application will be studied.  The cells will be                localized and the way in which they are connected to other parts                of the brain will be investigated.  This work will contribute to                fundamental knowledge of how the brain controls the respiratory                 and circulatory systems of the body.",
