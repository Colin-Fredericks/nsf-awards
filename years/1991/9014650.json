 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a classic 1969 paper, Lorenz proved that the                            predictability in a simple (frictionless and unheated) model of                 the earth's atmosphere was, in principle, limited to about five                 days.  Specifically, this meant that the forecast error would                   exceed the variability (say of wind, or pressure) on the actual                 map at the verification time of the forecast, after some forecast               period.  A better model and/or a more complete and accurate set                 of observations at initial time might reach this time of                        \"useless\" forecasts later, but even the best combination of these               would have to reach it in about five days. The predictability, by               this measure, in an actual operational forecast model now used in               the ECMWF has gone from five days in 1980 to eight days in 1990.                This operational model does include the effects of heating, and                 frictional and topographic interference with the flow caused by                 the earth's surface.  With these complications it is not amenable               to the type of theoretical treatment used by Lorenz.  However, it               is possible that precisely these complicating processes somehow                 enhance the predictability of the operational model.  Thus the                  time limit on useful forecasts has yet to be determined, and ways               to enhance the predictability deserve extended exploration.                          The objective of the research supported under this award is                to estimate the attainable enhancement of predictability by: i)                 Improving the model's treatment of the larger-scale flow                        components, which have the most obvious forecast errors, and                    which are most directly linked to pole to equator and continent-                ocean contrasts in heating and frictional/topographic                           interference; ii) Fitting a research version of the model with                  more detailed formulas for the calculation of momentum, heat, and               water exchanges with the underlaying surface, and iii) Studying                 the sensitivity of the global-scale forecast error growth rate                  to simulated observational errors in selected regions which are                 presumed to require fine mesh specification of the initial state.                    The PI's prior research in Numerical Weather Prediction,and                tropical, boundary layer, and mountain meteorology is especially                relevant to the proposed work.  These studies will increase our                 understanding of the factors affecting predictability, and are                  likely to contribute to further improvements in Numerical Weather               Prediction over the next decade.",
