 "awd_abstract_narration": "First order theories (and hence databases, knowledge bases, and                 logic programs) could be inconsistence in many ways.  For                       example, during the construction of an expert system, we may                    consult many different experts.  Each expert may provide us with                a group of rules and facts which are self-consistent.  However,                 when we coalesce the facts and rules provided by these different                experts, inconsistencies may arise.  Thus, a framework for                      reasoning about databases that contain inconsistent information                 is necessary.  This work will study at least three alternative                  theoretical frameworks for carrying out such forms of reasoning                 Such a study includes rigorously characterizing the meaning of                  inconsistent theories from a non-classical model-theoretic stad-                point.  Fixed-point characterizations of the different logical                  consequence relations, together with procedures for computing                   answers to such queries also come under the scope of the study.                 A prototype implementation which serves as an experimental test-                bed for evaluating computational aspects of these alternative                   semantical frameworks will be developed.",
