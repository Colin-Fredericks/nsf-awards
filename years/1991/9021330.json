 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, will study electron capture by                       molecules.  Electron capture finds application in                               identification and quantification of certain classes of                         molecules, most prominently halogen containing molecules which                  are of biological and environmental importance.  Prof.                          Grimsrud's research uses mass spectrometry to observe the                       process of electron capture and to quantify trace contaminants                  in samples.                                                                                                                                                     The unique aspect of Grimsrud's work is his use of                              photodetachment modulation.  This improves specificity and                      sensitivity in analytical measurements.  One can also                           differentiate electron capture capabilities of ground states                    and excited states, which is important in understanding how                     photochemistry modifies the chemistry of halogenated compounds                  in the environment.  The study of secondary processes                           (processes preceeding or succeeding the electron capture event)                 also is indicative of details of atmospheric pressure gas-phase                 chemistry of the studied compounds, and is useful in                            understanding unexpected sensitivity in analytical measurements.",
