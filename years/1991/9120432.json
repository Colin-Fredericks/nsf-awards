Having estimated the                high public return rates in seven industries from the total                     investment in academic research, this project will gather data and              information on:  (1) the sources of financial support for academic              research that has contributed significantly to industrial                       innovation; (2) the role of geographic proximity of the academic                researchers and industrial users; (3) the relationship of high                  payoff academic research to departmental quality ratings; (4) the               time frame of social benefits and costs from industrial innovation              based on academic research; and (5) begin preliminary work on the               economic effects of the industry cooperative research centers.",
