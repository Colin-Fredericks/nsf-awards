 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers have identified a number of factors that affect                     decision implementation (i.e., the linking of intentions and                    behavior).  While several important social psychological models                 include links between intentions and behavior, no adequate                      theoretical model of decision implementation exists for dealing                 with complex situations where implementation requires                           considerable time and effort at multiple points in time.  Such is                                                                                               the case with many important health  behaviors (e.g., adherence                 to diet, exercise, and medication regimens).                                                                                                                    This research will examine the role of self-schemata in decision                implementation.  Self-schemata are cognitive structures involving               generalizations about the self that are focused on aspects of the               self regarded by the individual as important.  Previous research                has linked self-schemata to self-reported behavior in both                      concurrent and prospective studies.  The research will determine                whether self-schemata moderate the strength of the relationship                 between individuals' intentions to diet and their dieting                       behavior, and examine on possible reason why this might occur:                  namely, that the dieting intentions of individuals who possess a                self-schema in this domain are more accessible from memory.                                                                                                     The research represents the first step in the development of a                  schema-based model of decision implementation.  It will                         contribute to our understanding of the role that the self plays                 in linking intentions and behavior, test the adequacy of several                social psychological models as regards the link between intention               and behavior, and extend schema theory by examining one possible                mechanism by which self-schemata may moderate intention-behavior                consistency.",
