 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to design and characterize a new               class of algorithms for allocating a set of computer programs to                multiple computers in a distributed computer system.  Program                   allocation strategies reduce the delay for a single user or maximize            the throughput of the distributed system as a whole.                                 Part 1:  Static Allocation.  The research will extend the work on          throughput optimization and delay minimization strategies for                   assigning programs to computers.  These optimization criteria have              been studied independently by Stone and by Shen and Tsai but their              interactions are not well understood.  The hybrid algorithms will               integrate Stone's maximum flow/minimum cut strategy with Shen and               Tsai's graph matching and A* strategies.  Because of a specific                 combination of improvements, the algorithms should outperform those of          Shen and Tsai.  The work proposes to use a more realistic system                description then the one assumed by Shen and Tsai.                                   Part 2:  Dynamic Allocation. The research attempts to integrate            sender-initiated with receiver-initiated strategies.  These strategies          have been studied separately by many researchers but their                      interactions are not well understood.  As with static allocation,               hybrid algorithms should perform better than one based solely on any            one strategy.  The project will demonstrate this advantage by using             specific performance parameters.  Values for model parameters will be           taken from actual measurements.",
