 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to extend the existing economic                  analysis of environmental problems from an essentially domestic                 perspective to one that incorporates explicitly the issues arising              in an international economy linked by trade, financial, and                     environmental flows.  The point of departure for this research is               a general conceptual framework that sets out the international                  gains from trade in environmental services.  The specific research              agenda addresses the issues of:  (1) the international transport                and disposal of hazardous wastes;  (2) the role of developing                   countries in the management of the global environment,  (3) the                 design and implementation of global measures for environmental                  regulation,  and  (4) the potential for using trade measures to                 penalize and provide inducements to countries that ignore the                   broader social costs of their economic activities.  A central theme             running through this research is the importance of distortions in               world prices and their implications for realizing the potential                 gains from trade in environmental services.",
