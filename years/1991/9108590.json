 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics at Southern University Baton Rouge                  (SUBR) proposes to carry out a comprehensive research and                       enrichment project for underrepresented and eligible minority                   physics undergraduates.  Referred to as the Timbuktu Academy,                   this project is named after the University of Timbuktu, a                       bastion of scholarship in the middle of this millennium.  The                   Timbuktu Academy  will enroll and support twenty (20) physics                   graduates, seventy per cent of whom  are expected to earn                       Ph.D. degrees in physics and related fields.  Research                          participation, enrichment activities, and a stimulating                         academic advisement are central activities of the Academy.                      The proposed activities are guided by basic  tents of                           cognitive science, the taxonomies of the cognitive and                          affective domains, and recommendations from several national                    reports.  About ten percent (10%) of African American scholars                  who earned Ph.D. degree in physics, in the last five years,                     are alumni of the SUBR Physics Department.  Recent                              enhancements of the Department's resources are added                            predictors of the expected success of the Academy.  Existing                    and future linkages and partnerships with federal, industrial,                  and academic laboratories are essential factors in support of                   the operation and expansion of this Academy for the                             development of research careers for minority Scholars (RCMS).",
