 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observations of the feeding activity of copepod populations                have revealed a wide range of responses both between and within                 species.  Feeding may be continuous, with no change in gut                      fullness on a diel period, or feeding may occur on a cyclical,                  diel pattern.  A diel pattern may be seen in both non-migratory                 copepods and in the absence of vertical stratification of                       chlorophyll a.  Recently, researchers have demonstrated that                    nocturnal grazing in Acartia tonsa was timed to lighting                        conditions.  However, while light may cue a feeding response,                   light conditions alone cannot explain an energetic advantage for                cyclical patterns in feeding.  One hypothesis is suggested                      Calanus finmarchicus, a vertical migrator, where a cyclical                     pattern is seen in gut cell development during feeding under                    experimental conditions.  These results indicate that during the                course of feeding certain cell types are depleted, and require a                non-feeding period to regenerate.  As a vertical migrator, C.                   finmarchicus has a natural period during the daylight hours in                  which to allow this regeneration.                                                    This research will investigate differences that might exist                in non-migrating copepods, exposed to continuous food.  This                    project will use morphometric analyses of the gut cells of the                  nearshore copepod Acartia tonsa over a 24-h period in the                       laboratory.  Analyses will be conducted at both the light and                   electron-microscope level.  Laboratory conditions will simulated                natural light and food conditions, and these results will be                    compared to samples taken from the field.  Patterns in                          physiological rates (digestive enzyme activity, glutamate                       dehydrogenase activity, and respiration rates) and gut fullness                 will be determined concurrently.",
