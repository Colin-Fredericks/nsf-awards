The researcher will receive advanced                statistical training to learn techniques appropriate for the                    analysis and interpretation of two large datasets.  One is                      concerned with the development of sex typing among 192 children                 aged 3-9 in four agrarian societies.  The second consists of                    cross-cultural ratings on the couvade, a custom in primitive                    societies where a father's behavior imitates some aspect of a                   mother's pregnancy/child-birth experience.  Both datasets are                   related to the expression of sex typing, particularly among                     males, and will analyze factors that dampen or heighten the                     degree of behavior and sociocultural differentiation between the                sexes.  The grant will allow extensive statistical tutelage by                  faculty at the University of California-Irvine.                                                                                                                 This project is important because it increases the quantitative                 expertise of a productive socio-cultural anthropologist.                        Cultural anthropology has not been known for quantitative                       methods, and the National Science Foundation instituted this                    funding opportunity to allow scholars to increase their research                abilities.",
