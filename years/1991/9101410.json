 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Analysis of Structures and Interfaces                       (CASI), a Minority Research Center of Excellence (MRCE) at                      City College of The City University of New York, proposes to                    increase the number of minority undergraduate students                          receiving research training and exposure in its focus areas of                  research.  Avenues for enhancement of undergraduate                             participation include (1):  placement in associate laboratories                 with research activities close to that conducted by CASI.  In                   these laboratories, as well as CASI laboratories, undergraduate                 students will be provided stipends and a modest supply budget;                  (2) development of a summer enrichment program for entering                     freshmen to promote successful launching of their college                       lives, thus aiding retention.  The summer enrichment program                    would have a component activity aimed at aiding students to                     assess career goals, and would provide a modest stipend to                      participants.  For graduate student participation, the Center                   proposes to increase the number of minority Ph.D. students it                   supports by six (for a total of eight) to allow CASI to match                   support with the actual number of minority graduate students                    presently involved in its laboratories.",
