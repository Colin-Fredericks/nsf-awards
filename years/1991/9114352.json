 "awd_abstract_narration": "With increased competition in the marketplace, many sectors                of the American economy are acknowledging the need for improved                 resource planning.  By way of example, note the growing acceptance              of the Just-In-Time philosophy in many manufacturing firms, the                 move toward dynamic routing capabilities within the                             telecommunication industry and adaptive signal control in urban                 traffic planning.  In each of these areas, resources (e.g.,                     productive capabilities and network capacities) are acquired well               in advance of their need, and utilization is improved by adaptive               allocation as precise system requirements are identified.  Since                precise information regarding system operation is not available at              the time of planning, the resource planning problem involves                    decision making under uncertainty.  This project focusses on                    modeling and solution of planning problems for systems that allow               adaptive resource allocation.  These methodologies are based on                 stochastic decomposition.  Computational experience with stochastic             decomposition indicates that it is ideally suited to the solution               of large scale problems involving optimal planning under                        uncertainty.  It is particularly useful when the variability of                 system requirements can only be assessed via simulated scenarios.                    The project involves three phases, involving the mathematical              development and verification of these methods, computer                         implementation of the resulting algorithms, and testing of these                algorithms on models based on case-studies which will be developed              in conjunction with industrial collaborators.",
