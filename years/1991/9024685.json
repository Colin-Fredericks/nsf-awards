 "awd_abstract_narration": "The formation of sand bars and other types of depositional                 landforms along stream channels is a function of many factors,                  especially the amount and nature of sediments carried by the stream and         the volume and velocity of stream water.  A factor often overlooked in          the analysis of depositional dynamics is the fluctuation of water               flows.  The Colorado River flowing through the Grand Canyon of Arizona          offers a unique setting for the analysis of changes in depositional             dynamics resulting from changing fluctuations in stream flows.  Prior           to construction of the Glen Canyon Dam above the canyon in the early            1960s, the Colorado's flow tended to follow annual cycles, with large           floods in spring followed by long periods of minimal flow.  The dam now         intercepts all upstream sediments, however, and discharges usually made         on a regular basis for power generation and flood control now produce           tidal-like daily pulses of water.  The lower-level but more frequent            fluctuations have had an adverse impact on the number and size of sand          bars along the canyon floor.  This project will examine the stability           of sand bars in the Grand Canyon under the current water discharge              regime, focusing special attention on the erosive effects of waves              below major rapids.  Research methods used in this project will                 include a number of approaches and measurement techniques commonly              employed in coastal studies but rarely used to study fluvial systems.           Sensitive instruments that measure water pressures and current speeds           and directions will gather data to test beach equilibrium models that           relate sediment erosion and accretion to wave parameters.  NSF funding          will complement support for this project provided by the U.S.                   Geological Survey.                                                                   This project will provide valuable data and new insights into the          dynamics of sand bar development in the Grand Canyon, a topic of great          practical importance because of the critical role of sand bars as               wildlife habitat and as recreational sites for people on float trips            down the Colorado.  The data collected in this project and the refined          models will have broad scientific significance, too.  They will expand          understandings of the complex dynamics of depositional features in              stream channels under different flow regimes and will provide the first         detailed examination of backwash wave impacts on sand bars in major             streams.",
