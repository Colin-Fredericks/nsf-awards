 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Museum of Natural History and the                             Environmental Defense Fund will produce a major exhibition                      on global warming.  The prospect of global warming is viewed                    by many with increasing attention and concern, but                              conflicting reports have resulted in public confusion about                     predictions of climate change.  Thus, a need exists for                         education on this timely subject, particularly in the direct                    and vivid way that only an exhibition provides.  Wide-spread                    awareness of the significance of potential climate change                       will lead to making informed decisions and taking necessary                     actions regarding this complex and serious problem.                                                                                                                  Visitors will learn about the forces that drive climate                    change, the sources and properties of greenhouse gases, how                     scientists study climate, and debates on the accuracy of                        global warming predictions.  The exhibition will also focus                     on potential environmental, social, and economic                                consequences of global warming and what choices individuals                     and nations can make to reduce emissions of greenhouse                          gases.  Visitors will be able to explore these topics in                        depth and integrate the information with personal                               experience.  The exhibition will present scientific data                        objectively, clearly distinguishing between what is known                       and what is predicted.                                                                                                                                               The American Museum and EDF will produce scientific                        symposia, educational programs, and publications for greater                    outreach to general visitors, schools and the media.                            Consultants will monitor and evaluate the content and                           design, from planning through fabrication and display, to                       ensure the educational effectiveness of the exhibition.",
