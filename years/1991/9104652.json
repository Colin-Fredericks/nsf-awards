 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the exosphere, the outermost fringe                 of the earth's atmosphere.  A preliminary investigation of                      existing terrestrial exosphere models indicates that errors, in                 some cases in excess of 2, are likely to have accrued from the                  use of simplistic approximations of collision processes.  The                   traditional concept of the exobase as a boundary between the                    thermosphere and a collisionless exosphere appears to have caused               major discrepancies.  Recent work by the Principal Investigator                 of this project on the quantum mechanics of H-H+ collisions shows               that the common presumption that charge exchange in non-                        scattering process has led to artificially low abundances of H                  atoms with satellite velocities.  With modern computers, many of                the inaccuracies that have resulted from traditional exosphere                  approximations can be avoided.  Works in progress to derive                     quantum mechanically correct methods for computer simulations of                key neutral-ion and neutral-neutral collision process.  These                   tasks are essential precursors to the accomplishment of the main                objective of this project:  the creation of realistic model                     exosphere distributions of atomic hydrogen and \"hot\" oxygen for                 equinox and solstice conditions over the solar cycle.                                The exosphere models to be addressed in this project are                   produced by computer simulation, using Monte Carlo methods that                 have been developing at UTD since 1973.  In an exosphere                        simulation, the trajectories of a large set of test atoms are                   traced from their entry into the exosphere to their escape from                 the planet.  Throughout the life of each atom, the computer                     accounts for kinetic and chemical effects of collisions with                    atoms, ions, and protons.  Statistical data representing the life               histories of the test atoms are converted into phenomenological                 hydrodynamic parameters in a process that is equivalent to Monte                Carlo integration of moments of the Boltzmann equation.",
