The project involves                            systematic investigation of oxidation processes that                            involve the use of ozone, hydrogen peroxide and                                 ultraviolet radiation.  The investigator plans to address                       the fundamental principles that are involved in these                           oxidation processes, characterize the rate at which they                        occur and determine the reaction mechanisms.  She will use                      the results of these studies to construct mathematical                          models that can be utilized in engineering design of                            decontamination processes for water and for treatment of                        wastewaters.                                                                                                                                                    Ozone, hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet radiation have                         been applied to treatment of water and wastewater without                       clear understanding of the chemical and physical                                mechanisms that are involved in their action on organic                         compounds.  This project is expected to provide insights                        into those processes that will permit better design of                          processes and systems than is now possible.",
