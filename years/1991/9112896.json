 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a student               of linguistic anthropology from the University of Texas.  THe                   project studies speech styles in rural Indian education in                      highland Bolivia to test the hypothesis that local Indian school                teachers are trained in speech styles radically different from                  those of the Indian homes.  This creates a communicative barrier                between teachers and students in the elementary classroom,                      despite the similarity of ethnic background of teachers and                     students.  Methods include ethnographic observation in classrooms               and homes, and videotaped speech interactions and audio-taped                   interviews.  Analysis will target participant cultural structures               and interactional rules using an \"ethnography of speaking\"                      approach.                                                                            This research is important because multicultural education                 is increasing in many countries as ethnic consciousness is                      heightened.  Understanding the nature of ethnically-based                       linguistic problems between teachers and children will help                     educational planners design programs to maximize the potential                  for success in formal education of subordinated groups.",
