 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in low                           temperature physics between Drs. Jay Dash and Oscar Vilches                     and their students, University of Washington, and Professors                    Michel Bienfait and Jean Suzanne, University of Aix-Marseille,                  France.  The objective of the proposed project is to carry                      out studies of surface melting in crystalline systems. Two                      systems of particular interest are hydrogen dioxide-ice and                     thick physisorbed films of solid hydrogen isotopes.                                                                                                             The surface melting of ice is of both fundamental interest                      and environmental importance.  Ice undergoes melting or                         disordering transitions at its surfaces with many types of                      solids.  The fundamental mechanisms which cause these                           changes, the characteristics of the transition layers and                       their dependence on the chemistry and morphology of the                         substrate are in dispute.  The proposed research will seek to                   determine these characteristics by a combination of techniques,                 especially neutron diffraction and quasi-electric neutron                       scattering.  The melting temperature of molecular hydrogen                      can be depressed to below 7.2 K by a combination of surface and                 quantum effects.  The study of this effect is of major                          importance to the understanding of quantum fluids and solid-                    liquid interfaces of dissimilar materials.  The proposed                        research focuses on characterization of the surface melted                      liquid by quasi elastic neutron scattering, complementary to                    thermodynamic measurements currrently underway at the                           University of Washington. The research will benefit from the                    complementary expertise of the two groups of investigators.                     Drs. Dash, Vilches and thier students have had a leading role                   in the study of adsorbed films and thier surfaces, particularly                 by thermoidynamic techniques.  Drs. Bienfait and Suzanne have                   ha a comparably prominent role in the study of these same                       systems, but primarily by scattering techniques.",
