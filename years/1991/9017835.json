 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tectonic history of the Canada Basin is poorly understood              and the Mesozoic history of the Arctic margin of Alaska & NW Canada             is critical to this problem.  Magnetic data from the oceanic crust              of Canada Basin are ambiguous and cannot distinguish between (1)                anticlockwise oroclinal rotation of the northern margin of Alaska               away from the Canadian Arctic Islands about a pole of rotation new              the MacKenzie delta, and (2) a major left-lateral transform fault               to permit the southerly migration of northern Alaska.  The two                  models predict different structural regimes for the eastern Brooks              Range, MacKenzie delta, and Black River-Oglivie Mountains regions               during the Mesozoic this project will address the problem by                    structural and kinematic studies along the Porcupine River fault                system and adjacent areas.  Spatial variations in the geometry of               superposed structures will be documented from Precambrian through               Cenozoic rocks, and ages of deformation all be established from                 stratigraphic and igneous intrusion relationships.  The results of              this study will improve our understanding of the tectonic evolution             of the Canada Basin and the adjacent Arctic region, and will also               have relevance to oil exploration in the area.",
