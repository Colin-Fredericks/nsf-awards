 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Euan Somerscales, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Drs.                     A.D. Mercer, P.E. Francis and A. Turnbull, National                             Physical Laboratory (NPL), Teddington, Middlesex, England.                      The objective of the project is the study of the transport                      of oxygen to a corroding heat transfer surface, using a                         unique piece of experimental equipment at the NPL.                                                                                                              The corrosion of heat transfer surfaces by flowing water                        can result in loss of material from the surface and                             eventual perforation. In addition, the accumulation of                          corrosion products introduces a thermal resistance which                        impedes the transfer of heat.  This is a topic of technical                     importance because of the almost universal use of water of                      various qualities, as a medium of heating or cooling.  In                       spite of this, the corrosion of heat transfer surfaces is                       not well understood from the fundamental point of view.                         Consequently, quantitative information of the type that would                   permit the designer and user of heat transfer equipment to                      predict with confidence the effects of corrosion on its                         life is not available. The proposed investigation will                          provide data on the mass transport rate of oxygen to a                          corroding surface under heat transfer conditions in turbulent                   flow.  The results of this research will make a significant                     contribution to the development of methods to predict the                       operating life and performance of heat transfer equipment,                      such as cooling passages of internal combustion engines,                        steam power plant condensers, and receivers of solar                            collectors.  The project will benefit from the complementary                    expertise of the U.S. and British investigators in the area                     of corrosion fouling of heat transfer surfaces, and from                        the availability of unique experimental equipment at NPL to                     carry out the proposed studies.",
