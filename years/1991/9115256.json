 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Ronald Benner is a research scientist at the Texas Marine              Science Institute at Port Aransas, on the Gulf of Mexico coast.                 The Institute is the oldest continuously operating marine research              lab on the Texas Gulf Coast, and it hosts active research by                    investigators from the University of Texas and many other                       organizations.  Dr. Benner proposes acquisition of an elemental                 analyzer (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) for                   general use at the Institute.  This instrument would be used by                 resident and visiting scientists in biogeochemical research in a                variety of coastal environments.  This instrument would replace an              obsolete instrument and would greatly expand the lab's research                 capacity.                                                                            The proposed instrument acquisition will have immediate and                beneficial impacts on many active research programs.  The number                and accuracy of chemical analyses will increase at the Institute,               and graduate students and advanced undergraduates will be exposed               to the most modern research equipment currently available.",
