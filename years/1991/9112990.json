 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will analyze the interactions of micro and macro               changes which occur during mold filling and curing in resin                     transfer molding (RTM) and structural reaction injection molding                (SRIM) processes.  The objectives are (1) to quantify the                       interactions between fiber wetting and molding filling during resin             injection and (2) to quantify the interactions between interface                bonding and matrix reaction during curing.  The knowledge gained                will be used to develop and optimize several new processing                     techniques for mass production of continuous fiber reinforced                   thermoset composites.  A systematic experimental and theoretical                analysis will be conducted.  The mold filling analysis includes                 microscopic flow visualization, dynamic wettability measurement,                pressure profile measurement inside the fiber reinforcement, flow               tracing and fiber distribution measurement in molded composites,                and process modelling.  The curing study includes kinetic analysis              by FTIR and FTIR-PLC spectroscopy, interface strength analysis and              mechanical property measurement.  Fiber reinforcements used will                be glass fibers in the form of continuous random mats, stitched                 unidirectional and bidirectional mats, and untreated and sized                  single fiber filaments.  Resins used will be low viscosity                      polyurethanes, unsaturated polyesters and  their hybrids.                            The study will allow the rational design of molded parts                   produced from dies and processes for the molding of composite                   materials and such understanding will improve the efficiency of                 such processes.",
