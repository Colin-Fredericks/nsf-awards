 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the quantum chemical group of                           Professor Ludwik Adamowicz of the University of Arizona in                      collaboration with the geophysics group of Professor Ivan                       Ortega-Blake of the Institute of Physics of the National                        University of Mexico (UNAM) at Cuernavaca.  The aim of the                      research is to study various elemental chemical processes                       related to phosphate-bond hydrolysis in order to better                         understand the crucial biological process of phosphate-bond                     hydrolysis as a source of bioenergy.                                                                                                                            The development of high-level theoretical methods for                           molecular electronic structures, as well as advancements in                     the theory of molecular interactions, have always been                          related to progress in computing technologies, both in                          hardware and software.  At present, accomplishing the                           solution of the Schrodinger equation for molecular systems                      with the number of electrons exceeding one hundred is                           potentially feasible.  This would allow the study of molecules                  and processes of biological interest such as the hydrolysis                     of phosphate compounds.  For these systems, besides the                         accurate ab-initio calculations, it is necessary to extend                      the theoretical models to include collective effects of                         condensed media via numerical simulations.  For this                            research,the theoretical methodologies developed by both groups                 are complementary and, when combined, will become a more                        powerful tool for theoretical explorations.  The expertise of                   the Arizona group lies in advanced quantum chemical techniques                  for determining molecular electronic structure and inter-                       molecular interaction energies.  The strength of the Mexican                    group rests on computer simulation techniques and determination                 of the macroscopic properties of gas and liquid phases.                         Ultimately, both groups share an interest in biologically                       relevant processes.",
