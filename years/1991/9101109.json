 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Center for Neurosciences and the               Department of Zoology at the University of Maryland College Park                (UMCP) to establish an REU Site Program to help develop                         undergraduate interest in biological research.  The program will                place emphasis on research in Neurobiology and Behavior and                     primarily involve students from the UMCP and its sister-campus,                 the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), a historically                 black campus of the University of Maryland.  Student research                   will be conducted at UMCP.  The program will place great effort                 on recruiting and training minorities and women, not only from                  UMCP and UMES, but also from other campuses of the University of                Maryland System with high minority enrollments.  The REU program                will introduce students to basic research by giving them the                    opportunity to work in active and productive research                           laboratories.  A major objective of the program is to provide                   students with a broader research/training experience than is                    typical with an individual student working in a research                        laboratory.  Taking advantage of the large number of active                     research programs in neurobiology and behavior at UMCP, students                will have substantial opportunities to interact with all of the                 faculty in the program in lectures, demonstrations, and field                   trips.  Students will benefit immensely by interacting among                    themselves and this will be developed through a bi-weekly                       student-led seminar, facilitated by a faculty member, but run by                students.",
