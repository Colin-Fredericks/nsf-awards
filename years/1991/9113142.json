 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three projects are planned, combining the numerical solution of                 partial differential equations with bifurcation-theoretic                       analysis.  First, a simplified model of the Belousov-Zhabotinski                reaction, designed for computational speed, is to be studied.                                                                                                   Second, a new numerical method has been developed for temporal                  integration of large stiff systems.  This method achieves                       stability without matrix inversion by instead exponentiating a                  small (Krylov) matrix.  The method will be modified to solve the                Navier-Stokes equations and its properties will be analyzed                     theoretically.                                                                                                                                                  Third, an existing numerical code which solves the Boussinesq                   equations of Rayleigh-Benard convection in a cylindrical                        geometry, will be used to study the breaking of axisymmetry, the                effects of rapid rotation, and the validity of two-dimensional                  model equations for pattern formation.                                                                                                                          Numerical solutions of partial differential equations are                       important both in their own right and in applications to a wide                 variety of physical science and engineering applications.",
