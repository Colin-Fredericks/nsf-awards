The study             focuses on the design and operation of the gas-graphite reactors                which constituted the French nuclear energy program in this time                period.  In the first part of the study, Ms. Hecht is tracing the               ways in which the political, economic, and technological agendas                of engineers, managers, public servants, and politicians became                 embodied in the design of these reactors.  In the second part she               is examining the emergence of nuclear safety regulations from the               social, cultural, and technological context of the work practices               of reactor operators.  The third and final part explains early                  public perceptions of nuclear energy in France by looking at how                nuclear plants affected regional lifestyles and economies.  The                 study's aim is to explore the reciprocal relationships between                  technology and society as well as the emergence of different                    \"nuclear cultures\" among politicians, engineers, technicians,                   workers and local residents.  It does so by analyzing a combination             of interviews, archival documents, and publications.  Its primary               significance lies in its exploration of relationships between                   national political agendas and technological change through an                  analysis of the organization of work, and in its examination of                 relationships between technological choice and cultural change.",
