In order to accomplish this goal,  NSF must first                become better informed of the barriers that beset minority                      scientists already in the pipeline.  Attendance at the workshop                 will be open to everyone.  The purpose of this workshop is to                   provide a framework that can serve as an operating model at the                 program level.  The eleven participants are already role models at              their respective institutions and will share their experiences with             the scientific community.  They are also principal investigators                of NSF research awards.  The charge to them is to suggest a                     feasible plan that will be available to everyone.//",
