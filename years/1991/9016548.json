 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Drosophila, position effect variegation results when a                       euchromatic gene has been placed adjacent to a block of centromeric             heterochromatin.  In this context the euchromatic genes adjoining               the heterochromatin are repressed in some cells, but not in others,             thereby giving rise to a tissue or organ composed of patches of                 mutant and wild type cells.  The most reasonable explanation for                the inactivation seen in variegating rearrangements, is that the                usual compacted structure of heterochromatin is propagated past the             breakpoint into the neighboring euchromatic sequences, thereby                  repressing their function.  We have shown that, in Drosophila,                  there are perhaps 20-30 dosage sensitive loci capable of dominantly             modifying variegation.  These are known as Enhancers and                        Suppressors of Variegation (E(var)and Su(var)) and may be divided               into two classes (I and II).  Class I genes behave as Enhancers                 when duplicated and as Suppressors when mutant or deficient.  Such              Loci are the majority type and probably code for structural                     polypeptides that composed heterochromatin.  On the other hand,                 class II genes function as E(var) when deficient and as Su(var)                 when duplicated.  Only two class II genes are known so far.  The                fact that the reduction or removal of a class II gene product may               increase the spread of a heterochromatic domain implies that the                wild type function of such loci negatively regulate the propagation             of heterochromatin.  This suggests that the class II genes play a               pivotal role in the assembly of heterochromatin.  In order to                   obtain a deeper understanding of position of effect variegation,                we propose to clone by recombinant DNA techniques the class II gene             E26A, and to understand how it participates in the assembly of                  heterochromatic domains.                                                                                                                                        The results from this study should provide greater insight into the             structure and function of eukaryotic chromosomes.",
