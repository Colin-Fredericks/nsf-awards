 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of a cultural anthropologist                   studying small wood-working firms in Mexico.  The research will                 examine a theory of \"institutional economics\" concerning the                    costs of transactions within and between firms.  The theory                     predicts that these transactions costs determine the shape and                  size of a firm, and this projects tests and advances this theory                by confronting it with data from small, often family-organized                  firms in a rural area of Mexico.  The theory was formulated to                  deal with all firms \"in the abstract\", but with often unconscious               bias towards the sorts of large firms one finds in developed,                   industrialized countries.   Confronting this theory with data                   from small family firms in a less developed country like Mexico                 will reveal logical inconsistencies and flaws that can be                       modified to improve its power and generality.",
