 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his research on the               variational bicomplex. This theory was first introduced                         approximately fifteen years ago to provide a uniform approach to                multi-integral problems in the calculus of variations. The                      bicomplex has also been used to solve inverse problems in calculus              of variations. The variational bicomplex plays a role in the                    geometric theory of differential equations somewhat analogous to                the role played by the deRham complex in finite dimensional                     manifolds. This theme will be developed in the research with                    application to specific examples a primary source of motivation.                     It is often useful to create a \"calculus\" or formalism which               can be applied to a large number of problems of a class. The                    formalism being studied in this research applies to the class of                problems known as variational problems. These problems arise                    naturally in a very wide range of circumstances in natural science.             A simple example would be the problem of determining, among all                 curves on a surface connecting two points, the one with  the                    shortest length.",
