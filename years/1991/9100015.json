 "awd_abstract_narration": "Highly chlorinated compounds have been manufactured by the chemical             industry for several decades now, resulting in their release into               the environment.  While simple chlorinated compounds are                        biodegradable, highly chlorinated compounds are quite persistent                due to limited breakdown by natural microflora which reflects the               absence of degradative genes against such compounds in these                    microorganisms.  We have thus been interested in understanding how              new genes encoding degradation of simple chlorinated compounds                  evolve in nature with the hope that such understanding may help us              to accelerate the process of evolution in a laboratory setting                  against highly chlorinated compounds.  Three structural genes                   encoding the degradative enzymes of 3 chlorocatechol and a                      regulatory gene that regulates positively the expression of the                 three structural genes, have been mapped on a plasmid pAC27 in a                main strain of Pseudomonas putida as an operon ( the clc operon),               similar to another set of chromosomal genes that allow degradation              by P. putida of the natural parent compound, catechol ( the cat                 operon).  This grant seeks to determine how the products of the                 regulatory genes catR and clcR bind with the operator/promoter                  regions of the two operons catBC and clcABD to allow transcription              of these two operons in presence of the inducers cis, cis-muconate              and 2 chloro-cis, cis-muconate.  Since the genetic organization of              the two operons is quite similar, and the individual genes of these             two operons demonstrate extensive homology, it is important to                  understand how genes for a regulated pathway, which includes a                  chlorinated compound as an inducer, evolve from ancestral genes                 that encode dissimilation of an analogous non-chlorinated compound.             The molecular details of specific nucleotides in the catBC and                  clcABD operator/promoter regions that are involved in the binding               with CatR and ClcR in presence of the non-chlorinated and                       chlorinated muconates as well as the amino acids of the regulatory              proteins CatR and ClcR that are involved in specific base contacts              in the operator/promoter region, will provide considerable insight              regarding the mechanism of evolution of regulatory systems in                   response to the release of chlorinated compounds.",
