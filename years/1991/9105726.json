 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to study chloroplast mRNA                       processing, with an emphasis on mRNA splicing, as a way to enhance              our understanding of chloroplast biogenesis and function.  Previous             results have posed intriguing questions about the processing and                splicing of a gene cluster in spinach chloroplasts that encodes                 four of the nine chloroplast ATP synthase subunits.  Preliminary                data suggests that chloroplast mRNA splicing may result in multiple             branch points within the same intron.  One of the three objectives              of this proposal is to investigate those preliminary results.  The              PI has detected splicing activity in spinach chloroplast extracts.              Tow objectives of this proposal are dedicated to the stabilization              and initial characterization studies on this in vitro splicing                  activity.                                                                                                                                                       It is not known whether splicing is a rate limiting step in the                 control of gene expression, but it is an indispensable step in the              production of several essential gene products.  In this proposal,               the plan is to study chloroplast splicing both in vivo and in vitro             in order to begin to understand this complex process and the                    factors that regulate it.  Chloroplast gene expression is regulated             by several factors including light, heat stress, and physiological              factors.  This work will help to elucidate control points that                  regulate chloroplast biogenesis and function.//",
