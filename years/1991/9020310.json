 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalysis plays an essential role in many commercially important                chemical reactions and is also an important element in most                     biochemical reactions.  The focus of this grant is on models for                heterogeneous catalysis under flow conditions, as they provide a                paradigm of a nonequilibrium system which can exhibit phase                     transitions between steady states, macroscopic oscillations and                 even chaotic behavior.  An objective is to understand the effects               of spatial correlations and fluctuations on the dynamic and static              properties of a system in a nonequilibrium steady state,                        particularly near a nonequilibrium phase transition.  Research will             be conducted on models for heterogeneous catalysis which exhibit                both continuous and discontinuous transitions between steady                    states.  These studies will be done using numerical simulation and              by finite size scaling analysis.  A numerical renormalization group             analysis of the master equation will also be developed.  These                  methods will be applied to study the effects of correlations and                noise in systems that show transitions to time-dependent periodic               and chaotic behavior.",
