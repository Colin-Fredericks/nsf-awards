 "awd_abstract_narration": "A newly developed method which incorporates a parametrized, quantum             mechanical, nearest neighbor total energy expression for silicon                into a \"ficticious Lagrangian\" molecular dynamics scheme developed              by Car and Parinello will be expanded to model the germanium-                   silicon solid solution system.  A novel full range, parametrized                total energy expression for the germanium-silicon system based on               the local density approximation with complete transferability will              be constructed.  This total energy expression is parameterized                  against a large data base which is derived from experiment and                  state of the art local density approximation calculations.                      Computationally, it will only be slightly more demanding than the               calculations for silicon alone, and finite temperature simulations              of hundreds of atoms could be performed in tens of Cray YMP hours,              a factor of about 50 more rapidly than the best local density                   approximation calculations.  The study of the epitaxial growth of               germanium-silicon will be done by breaking the problem into smaller             components which can be studied individually; namely, relaxation of             surfaces, steps and kinks, sticking and diffusion of an atom on                 this surface, dynamics of atoms near a relaxed kink, and growth of              kinks into steps.                                                               %%%                                                                             Computational techniques will be developed to model the total                   energies of germanium-silicon mixtures - an important material for              the electronics industry.  The proposed technique will accelerate               the calculation of important properties.  The proposed techniques               have the potential to have a major impact on the way that these                 properties are calculated and can be applied to other materials of              scientific and commercial interest.",
