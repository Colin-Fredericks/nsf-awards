 "awd_abstract_narration": "An invitational workshop is proposed on terrestrial and aquatic                 ecosystems in the Dry Valleys of Antarctic.  The purpose of the                 workshop is to bring together leading experts in Antarctic and                  comparable ecosystems in Arctic and Temperate regions to discuss                the scientific priorities for future research in the Dry Valleys.               A second major aspect of this workshop will be the consideration                of technological, logistical, operational, and environmental                    concerns associated with the conduct of this research. The                      motivation for holding this workshop is the increased scientific                interest and concern that the Antarctic Dry Valleys may be one of               the best barometers of climatic change.  The 3 day workshop will                be held at the New York Botanical Gardens' Institute of Ecosystem               Studies.  Several foreign scientists will included in the                       workshop. The organizing committee will model the workshop after                the very successful Dalhem conferences which allow participants                 to provide input and discussion on each topic.  A report will be                published and distributed following the workshop.",
