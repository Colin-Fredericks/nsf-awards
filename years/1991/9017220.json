 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research             project in climate change and mesoscale meteorology between Dragutin            Mihailovic of the University of Novi Sad's Institute of Field and               Vegetable Crops and Roger A. Pielke of Colorado State University is             to investigate land surface - atmosphere interactions.  These                   studies will contribute to improved weather and climate prediction              models and enhance understanding of climate impact on ecosystems and            the environment.  Yugoslav collaboration adds an international                  dimension to Dr. Pielke's NSF research grant on the Influence of                Surface Heat and Moisture Fluxes on Mesoscale Climate and Weather.              In his NSF grant, Dr. Pielke developed the RAM model (Regional                  Atmospheric Modeling).  The objective of this cooperation is                    improvement of the RAM through the development of finer                         specifications of land surface parameters.  Yugoslav involvement                consists of integrating soil and vegetation parameterizations into              the Colorado State RAMS model and testing its accuracy by using                 field data derived from the agricultural belt of Yugoslavia.                                                                                                    This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The award,                except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav             institution.  NSF's objective of advancing scientific knowledge will            be promoted through this joint scientific effort and complementary              expertise of the Yugoslav and U.S. scientists.",
