 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this program is to investigate the causes of semiconductor          wafer damage during oxygen photoresist stripping with a downstream              microwave plasma.  The use of oxygen plasmas for dry stripping of               photoresist eliminates the handling, disposal, and resist degradation           problems associated with liquid processes.  A downstream, microwave-            produced plasma has the additional advantages of no electrode                   contamination and low plasma potentials.                                                                                                                        However, as with other plasma etching methods, downstream microwave             processing is associated with wafer damage including mobile ion                 contamination and electrostatic breakdown of oxide gates, wall-sourced          contamination, and degradation from chemical or structural changes.             The causes of such surface damage are not well understood.                                                                                                      We propose to correlate such damage with plasma source phenomena such           as UV radiation and surface charging.  During phase I, we will make             radial and axial scans of plasma density, electron temperature, and             space potential in the vicinity of the wafer while monitoring neutral           gas constitutents for a range of stripping rates and plasma source              operating points.                                                                                                                                               For phase II, on the basis of CV curve shift analyses we will                   correlate damage with plasma associated phenomena such as UV, surface           charging, synergistic effects, and wall-sourced contaminants and                develop means of effectively curtailing them.",
