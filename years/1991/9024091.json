 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Gellene is supported by a grant from the Experimental                 Physical Chemistry Program to use absorption and emission                       spectroscopy to study the neutral radicals which are in the                     neighborhood of the transition state on the potential energy                    surface of a polyatomic molecule.  The neutral radicals are                     produced by reneutralization of an ion beam and either remain                   in the transition state long enough to be observed in                           absorption spectroscopy or are in excited Rydberg states which                  vertically radiate to transition state regions by emission.                     Probing the transition state directly is important because the                  characteristics of the transition state region largely                          determine reactive events.  This approach is potentially                        applicable to systems for which the geometry of the positive                    ion closely resembles that of the transition state region.                      Specifically the technique will be applied to a study of 3- and                 4-atom radicals containing H(or D), N, O and F.                                 %%%                                                                             By preparing a species that has a structure that is in between                  the reactants and the products and doing spectroscopy on it in                  the relatively short time that it exists in this geometry,                      Professor Gellene hopes to characterize that state, called the                  transition state, which largely determines how a chemical                       reaction proceeds.",
