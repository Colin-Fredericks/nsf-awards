 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to study the ability of biologically                          active filters to absorb, adsorb and stabilize volatile                         organic compounds that are emitted from industrial and                          municipal waste processing systems.  Experimentation in                         this project initially involves passage of synthetic gas                        streams containing trichloroethylene through a                                  biologically active medium that initially will be enriched                      for favoring methanotrophic microbial organisms.  Other                         organic compounds to be included include 1,2                                    dichloroethylene, benzene and toluene.                                                                                                                          This proposal was submitted in accord with the NSF Program                      Announcement 89-60, Research in Undergraduate                                   Institutions.  Previous efforts to remove volatile organic                      compounds from process streams to reduce their emission to                      the air have demonstrated the efficacy of                                       physical/chemical systems.  The physical/biological                             process this research addresses has promise of removing                         the potential air pollutants from gases prior to their                          being exhausted to the atmosphere at significantly.",
