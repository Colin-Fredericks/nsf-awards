 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concerns about global warming and the loss of biological diversity           have focused attention on development processes in tropical forests,            which traditionally have been the locations of a large share of the             world's biomass and of many of its plant and animal species.  Recent            research by geographers, anthropologists, and other social and natural          scientists has helped improve understandings of the processes by which          humans and natural systems interact with each other.  Of special                interest have been the impacts of different types of economic activities        and land-use practices on forests.  This project will examine the               economic potentials and ecological viability of traditional farm- and           forest-management practices of indigenous residents along the estuary of        the Amazon River west of Belem in Brazil.  The spatial structure of             different management practices will be mapped using data from satellite         images, and field observations will be used to measure the sizes and            patterns of tracts worked by individual households.  Additional                 information about the economics of indigenous management practices will         be gathered through participant observation, questionnaire responses,           interviews with household members, and data gathered by local                   informants.                                                                        This project will contribute to greater knowledge about the ways that        agricultural changes affect traditional indigenous resource-management          and land-use practices in the lower Amazon basin and in other similar           locales.  In addition to enhancing understandings of interactions among         human and natural systems, the conclusions of this project also should          provide considerable information of use to managers trying to determine         what forms of tropical forest development will improve the economic             standing of local residents without harming the natural environment.",
