 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of an                           anthropology student studying gender relations in Sweden.                       Although Swedish society has outstanding laws on the books                      dealing with gender egalitarianism in the workplace, Swedish                    society remains strikingly segregated by gender in fact.  The                   student will interview female students, professionals at the                    beginnings of their careers, and mature professionals about life-               history experiences that influenced them to choose their                        professions.  The student will also interview parents, friends,                 spouses, teachers, and other relevant individuals to try to                     understand the reasons why women choose their occupations.                                                                                                      This research is important because government policies often                    mandate egalitarian social outcomes that are not achieved in                    practice.  Understanding the non-governmental causes of gender                  segregation in a society that has the most advanced laws known in               the industrialized world can help planners devise programs to                   attain the goal of equal opportunity.",
