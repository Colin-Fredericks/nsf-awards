 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop cost-effective  computer architectures that take advantage of rapidly changing  technologies.  The thrust of this work is in memory systems,  which must supply information to increasingly-faster processors.  As  microprocessors approach the cycle time of supercomputers, the memory  system (including I/O) becomes the main difference between a personal  computer and a mainframe.  Current research focuses on developing new techniques for analyzing  memory system performance.  One new approach uses a renewal-theoretic  model to improve the accuracy of time-sampled trace-driven  simulations.  This model promises to substantially reduce simulation  time (10-fold) with only a small decrease in accuracy (less that 10%).  Another new technique is cache profiling.  Similar to traditional  execution time profilers, a cache profiler relates a program's cache  performance to its source listing.  Programmers and compiler writers  can use this information to optimize the cache performance of their  programs, restructuring code and changing algorithms.  Computer  architects use this tool to better understand cache access  patterns, leading to improved cache designs, synchronization  mechanisms, and prefetch strategies.",
