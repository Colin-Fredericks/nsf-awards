 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supported under the Research in Undergraduate                   Institutions Program.  The purpose of this research is to analyze               the substitutability of public and private spending in the United               States.  This is a very important issue because the degree of                   substitutability has major implications for macroeconomic policy.               If consumers view public outlays as close substitutes for their own             personal expenditures, then increases in government spending could              result in commensurate decreases in private spending, nullifying                the expansionary impact of the fiscal policy.                                                                                                                   The project will examine this issue at the disaggregated level.                 Statistical analyses looking for significant correlations between               the different components of government and consumer expenditures                will be undertaken.  This will help to determine what underlies                 the aggregate relationship between public and private spending.                 The plausibility of the correlations at the disaggregated level                 should help determine whether any relationship that exists at the               aggregate level is reasonable or is the result of spurious                      correlation.",
