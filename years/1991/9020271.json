 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biology Department at California State University, Los                    Angeles will institute a program to recruit high school                         graduates, community college graduates, Cal State L.A.                          matriculated students, graduates from other colleges and                        universities, and current high school biology teachers into a                   research and mentoring oriented program designed to increase                    the number of minority students who matriculate into Ph.D.                      degree programs.  The research areas that are involved in this                  program are ecology/environmental biology, genetics,                            molecular biology, and physiology.  Students who take part in                   this program will be active researchers in the laboratories of                  biology faculty members with proven research track records.                       The students will also be involved in an ongoing                              faculty/student mentoring program funded by California State                    University, Los Angeles.  Several federal reports have                          indicated that the United States faces a severe shortage of                     science faculty members by the year 2010 if more students do                    not become interested in teaching and research careers.  The                    demographic makeup of the United State is changing,                             particularly in the younger age groups.  Black and Hispanic                     school children are projected to comprise 47% of the total                      school age population by the 2000 and this change has already                   occurred in the Los Angeles area.  The only way that the                        United States can meet future potential Shortfalls of                           scientists is by recruiting, retaining, and graduating more                     minority students and this California State University, Los                     Angeles program will help in this regard.",
