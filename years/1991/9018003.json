 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-range goal of this research is to identify, clone, and                 sequence genes encoding allorecognition determinants from the                   colonial hydroid, Hydractinia.  Work to date has shown the                      feasibility of producing isogenic colonies which differ in their                histocompatibility responses.  During this grant period, the                    applicants propose to: 1)  continue ongoing analysis of the                     transmission genetics of fusibility in this hydroid, 2) produce,                in bulk, tissues from isogenic colonies which differ in their                   fusibility responses, and 3) generate cDNA libraries from these                 tissues.  This effort will yield the materials necessary to pursue              subtractive hybridization as a strategy for isolating the genes of              interest.                                                                                                                                                       It is well known that vertebrate animals have well developed immune             mechanisms for rejection of foreign tissues, but little is known                about such mechanisms in invertebrates.  The proposed research                  represents a collaborative effort between an invertebrate zoologist             and a molecular immunologist.  Their ultimate goal is to accomplish             the first unambiguous characterization of the molecules involved                in an invertebrate self-recognition (tissue-type) response.  The                results of this research ultimately should resolve the long-                    standing question of the phylogenetic relationships of invertebrate             and vertebrate self-recognition and immune-like defense responses.",
