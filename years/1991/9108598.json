 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lateral confinement of concrete by means of spirally winding a                  pretensioned tape of epoxy-impregnated high-strength aramid fiber               onto the concrete surface increase the compressive strength of                  concrete,  increases the maximum attainable strain (ductility),                 provide a mechanims for shear resistance, and inhibits longitudinal             reinforcement buckling. The primary advantages of fiber-made tapes              as compared to steel strands or rods are: higher contact area and               low profile, no corrosion, possibility of pretensioning even with               prismatic cross sections, and automatic installation.  In this                  project, an extensive experimental and analytical study of this                 strengthening/repair technology is conducted using 1/4 scale                    specimens with different cross sections and longitudinal/transverse             steel reinforcement characteristics, and subjected to combined                  cyclic loads (axial, shear, and bending).  The reinforcing tape                 consists of a flattened tube made of braided aramid (Kevlar) fiber              with different areas, spiral pitches, and levels of prestress being             investigated.  A winding machine previously constructed by Mitsui               Construction Co. with the participation of this PI, is used for the             proposed research with the objective of continuing and improving                international scientific cooperation on the use of new construction             materials.",
