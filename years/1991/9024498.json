 "awd_abstract_narration": "International commercial arbitration has become a vital institution             in the emerging global economy and has displaced litigation in many             instances.  Business entities and governments for various reasons               have turned increasingly to international commercial arbitration                in order to process the transnational disputes that inevitably                  arise with increased trade and commerce.  The disputes are part of              a competitive process which involves arbitration centers, legal                 professionals, and sets of governing norms.  Understanding the                  patterns of this disputing is crucial to understanding how business             transactions will be regulated within the new global order.                                                                                                     This project explores the development of and variations in                      international commercial arbitration.  The research draws generally             on four bodies of theoretical literature:  private governance, the              role of multinational enterprises in the global economy, disputing              processes, and the internationalization of the legal profession.                Approximately 100-150 lawyers and arbitrators in six international              cities will be identified and interviewed to create the primary                 data set.  Additional data will include historical, descriptive                 data and statistical data from several arbitration centers in order             to document changes in this practice in recent years.                                                                                                           This study of international commercial arbitration provides a                   unique opportunity to bring a rich body of research to a neglected              aspect of business disputing and therefore to explore the emerging              system of private and public governance in the field of                         international commerce.   The research promises to add                          substantially to our understanding of the development of private                sector dispute resolution and its relationship both to the public               courts and the private agendas of professional groups and                       corporations.  In addition, private governance and global business              will be related to the question of what lawyers have to offer in                a regime beyond nation states.",
