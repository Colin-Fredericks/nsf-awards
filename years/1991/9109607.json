 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the transition period between leaving                   school and obtaining one's first full-time job.  It is generally                observed that the difficulty in obtaining the first job increases               the longer one is without a job, and that the wage received on the              first deceases as well with the length of the search period.  In                addition, groups which have shorter transition periods also tend                to have higher wages.  These observations are not easily reconciled             within standard economic models of job search.  It has been shown               that a bargaining model in which the value of the firm-worker                   pairing is split according to each party's value of continuing to               search can potentially explain these empirical regularities.  The               purpose of this research is to estimate rigorously such a                       bargaining model using data on the length of the transition period              and wages for individuals from different race-schooling groups.                 This research is important because estimation will not only provide             explanations for the data, but also will enable one to analyze the              impact of alternative intervention policies such as minimum wages               and unemployment compensation on the school-to-work transition.",
