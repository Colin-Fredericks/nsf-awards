 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop on progress in                    catalyst preparation to be held in Mar del Plata, Argentina,                    during the 7th through the 10th of October, 1991, with the                      participation of eight scientists from the U. S. and nine                       from Argentina.  The workshop will cover the following three                    topics:  1) catalyst precursors and their method of addition,                   such as impregnation, precipitation, and ion exchange, 2)                       activation treatments, such as calcination, oxidation, and                      reduction, 3) modification of catalytic properties, such as                     surface modification by ion exchange, and bulk modification                     by metal substitution or complex inclusion.  The workshop                       will be restricted to the types of catalysts extensively                        investigated in both countries, to favor discussion and                         further cooperation.  Thus, the workshop will be mainly                         dedicated to supported metal and metal oxide catalysts, and                     modified molecular sieves and layered structures.  Emphasis                     will be placed on the characterization of the preparation                       and  modification steps and their influence upon catalytic                      properties.                                                                                                                                                     Recently a rapidly widening number of American researchers is                   becoming involved in this area.  In Argentina the situation                     is  similar where the school of catalysis is of American and                    European origin, and the Argentine work in catalyst preparation                 is significant.  This workshop by bringing together scientists                  from Argentina and the U.S. will lead to further collaboration                  in catalysis which will increase productive output and                          benefit research in both countries.",
