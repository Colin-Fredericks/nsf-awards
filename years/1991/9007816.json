 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves continued research in security of distributed             systems and development of a formal protection model called the                 Distributed Model (D-Model).  The D-Model defines concurrency                   conditions which guarantee that a  concurrent system cannot reach a             state in which privileges are configured in a non-secure manner.                This work will extend the D-Model to include the security correctness           criteria of trusted subjects.  So far the D-Model conditions have been          used to construct a distributed version of the Bell-LaPadula security           model.  There are more applications of the D-Model within this                  project, such as the Clark-Wilson Model,  Minsky's transfer of                  privilege model, and the Military Message System Model (MMS) of                 Landwehr.                                                                            The second phase of the formal modeling part of this project will          develop a so-called General Purpose Distributed Security Model                  (GPDSM).  The result of this model will be a set of security models             that can be used to depict all computer systems within the state-of-            the-art.  The GPDSM must be formalized in the first step.  After the            formalization, any model (e.g. the D-Model, MMS and Non-interference            models) can be implemented in GPDSM.  Since synchronization is an               important issue for constraining concurrency in distributed and                 parallel systems, the D-Model will be ported to a non-interference              model framework (which is the GPDSM) in order to find a solution for            non-interference synchronization problem.  The D-Model has currently            no associated covert channel analysis tool.  The proposed GPDSM will            also serve as both a model and a covert channel analysis tool.",
