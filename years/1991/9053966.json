 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, Women in Engineering, Science and Technology                 (WEST), established at New Jersey Institute of Technology,                      will facilitate the transfer of women, upon completion of                       their community college curricula, from 19 New Jersey                           community colleges to engineering, science and technology                       programs at four year colleges and universities. During the                     first year, the WEST office will work with some of the 14                       community colleges with which articulation agreements already                   exist. Special efforts will be made with urban-based colleges                   enrolling a high percentage of minority women After the first                   year, WEST will expand its efforts to other community                           colleges in the state. One goal is to recruit at least 200                      women per year to the project through career days and                           seminars.                                                                       Evaluation and assessment of project outcomes will be                           determined by:                                                                                                                                                       - the percent increase of women enrolled in engineering,                          science & technology programs at community colleges                             who transfer to 4-year colleges at the end of Spring                            1992 semester.                                                                                                                                                - the percent increase of community college women with                            undeclared majors who choose engineering, science and                           technology majors at the end of the Fall 1991 and                               Spring 1992 semesters.                                                                                                                                        - pre and post surveys to measure attitudes toward                                engineering, science and technology.",
