 "awd_abstract_narration": "Certain snake venoms contain toxins, called alpha-neurotoxins,                  which cause muscle paralysis by blocking the normal action of the               neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, at its site of action on the                   muscle surface.  One of these toxins, called alpha-bungarotoxin,                has been particularly useful to biochemists interested in                       studying the acetylcholine receptor on the muscle membrane.  In                 order to understand the action of these toxins at the muscle                    receptor and to determine what it is about the alpha-bungarotoxin               molecule that targets it for the muscle receptor, synthetic genes               can be produced for this protein.  With the gene in hand one can                develop a procedure for preparing large amounts of genetically-                 modified toxin.  By systematically altering different parts of                  the toxin protein, one can identify the sites on the toxin which                \"recognizes\" the receptor.  The determination of the structural                 changes in the protein will depend on sophisticated new                         techniques taking advantage of instrumentation using high                       magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses.  This type of                        recognition is also how drugs recognize their target sites.  This               work will help us understand the chemically-important structures                which allow chemicals and biological molecules to interact.",
