 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns two aspects of protein folding and                       stability: the nature of partially-folded species, especially                   the molten globule state, and the factors which determine a                     particular folding pathway.  The long-term goals are to learn                   how the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide guides the folding                 to the native state, and determines the stability of protein                    conformations.  A relatively compact protein conformational                     state, often referred to as the molten globule state, has been                  shown to be an intermediate in the refolding of certain                         proteins, and to be stable under certain denaturation                           conditions for some proteins.  One of the goals of this                         research is to increase the understanding about the molecular                   details and physical properties of molten globules.  The molten                 globule state will be studied under both equilibrium and                        transient refolding conditions.  In addition the pathway of                     folding will be mapped out by using specific signals from                       different regions of the molecule in stopped-flow kinetics                      experiments at both ambient and subzero temperatures.  A                        variety of biophysical techniques will be used to structurally                  characterize the molten globule state from several different                    proteins (in order to establish generalities); these include                    FTIR, circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence and hydrodynamic                    radius measurements.  In addition kinetic experiments using                     stopped-flow fluorescence and CD will be performed.",
