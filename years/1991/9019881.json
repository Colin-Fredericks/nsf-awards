 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antarctic fish live in waters that are perennially at the freezing              point of body fluids.  These waters would be devoid of fish if                  these fish had not evolved biological antifreeze molecules to avoid             freezing.  The evolutionary aspects of antifreezes in Antarctic                 fish possess considerable scientific interest.  Dr. Arthur DeVries              began his studies on antifreezes in Antarctic fish over three                   decades ago and has systematically investigated the mechanism by                which antifreezes confer freezing avoidance on the whole animal.                This research project will continue the study of how antifreezes                evolved in the Antarctic fishes by examining the physiological and              mechanistic processes involved in freezing tolerance.                           Physiological studies include synthesis of antifreezes and factors              that govern synthesis, secretion, fluid and tissue transport, and               conservation of antifreezes.  Mechanistic studies focus on                      understanding how antifreezes adsorb to ice and inhibit ice crystal             growth.  Aside from the intrinsic value of the project, freezing                avoidance in fish could have implications to the fields of human                pathologies, in nucleation theory, and in crystallography.",
