 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Reisler is supported by a grant from the                           Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for a two-part study:                   One is the photodissociation dynamics of small polyatomic                       molecules with emphasis on the influence of the electronic                      structure of the excited state on the dynamics.  The other is                   collisional dissociation of highly vibrationally excited                        molecules.  The experiments will be done with crossed molecular                 beams, multiphotoionization detection and photoinitiated                        vibrational excitation; product state distributions will be                     measured.  The ultimate goal is to achieve better control over                  the outcomes of molecular dissociations by selective access to                  specific regions of the potential surface.  The immediate goal                  is to study the evolution of parent molecule excitation into                    product fragment excitations.  The systems to be studied are                    cyanogen halides and related molecules.                                         %%%                                                                             The influence of the stretching and bending motions in the                      molecule on the final outcome when light causes a molecule to                   come apart into fragments will be studied. The questions to be                  answered in this study are: What products are formed and how is                 the energy disposed of among these fragments, that is, what is                  the energy distribution into the various forms of internal                      energies of the fragments?",
