 "awd_abstract_narration": "A controversy exists surrounding the age assignment of the                 Erin Slate, outcropping in the Talladega Slate Belt of Alabama.                 The age assignment of this unit has become pivotal in the                       paleotectonic interpretation and timing of emplacement of the                   Talladega slate belt in the southern Appalachian orogen.  The                   disputed age assignment of the Erin Slate is based on the reported              presence of permineralized Carboniferous lycophyte cones,                       Lepidostrobus hobbsii D. White.  Subsequent workers were unable to              collect additional permineralized fossil plants, although                       compression-impressions have been documented in the matrix and an               indistinguishable petrologic similarity between the Erin Slate and              matrix adhering to one of the cones exists.  The lack of                        subsequently collected material, equal in preservational mode and               type to that of the original two lycophyte cones, has led some                  workers to question the validity of a fossiliferous Erin.  The                  original plant fossils are currently considered to be \"exotics\",                and the Erin Slate has been lithostratigraphically correlated with              the Early Devonian Jemison Chert.  Newly discovered permineralized              plant fossils provide unequivocal evidence that the Erin slate is               fossiliferous.  The project herein proposed is designed to assess               this newly recovered paleobotanical evidence for a definitive age               assignment of the Erin Slate and its regional correlatives.  The                taxonomic diversity and systematic affinities of this                           permineralized flora will be ascertained and compared with those                plants of homologous structural advancement, paleogeographic                    distribution, and biostratigraphic position.  The age assignment                based on the constraints of the paleobotanical evidence will form               the foundation for evaluating the tectonic setting of the Erin                  Slate and its relationship to the tectonic framework now proposed               for the southern Appalachians.//",
