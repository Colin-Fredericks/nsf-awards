 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study the phylogeny and geography of host                associations among populations of Papilio zelicaon (Lepidoptera)                that differ in the host plants they use in northwestern United                  States and southwestern Canada.  The proposed work will use the                 broad range of umbelliferous species fed on by P. zelicaon to                   relate the intraspecific geographic patterns of host use to                     phylogeny.  Objective 1 of the proposed work will test for                      differences in oviposition preference and specificity among                     females from populations that are oligophagous.  The oviposition                preference and specificity trials will show the geographic                      pattern for variation in oviposition preference and specificity                 among females tested.  Objective 2 will take advantage of                       molecular techniques to analyze mitochondrial DNA and allozyme                  variation and construct a phylogeny of host use the same                        populations used in objective 1.  In objective 3 the same                       techniques will be used to show the number of times a novel host                (fennel, Foeniculum vulgare) has been colonized, and the extent                 to which fennel-feeding populations have diverged from native                   host populations.  Together, these 3 objectives will provide a                  better understanding of how phylogeny and geography interact to                 produce regional patterns of host specificity in phytophagous                   insects.",
