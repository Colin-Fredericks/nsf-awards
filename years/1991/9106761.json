 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Patrick Kirch, Ms Dana Lepofsky, a                   graduate student at the University of California/Berkeley, will                 collect data for her doctoral dissertation.  Her research                       focusses on the prehistory of the Society Island group in                       Polynesia and she will conduct extensive survey and limited                     excavation in a variety of environmental zones on several                       islands.  In particular, her work will focus on the development                 of agriculture and her survey will note the position of                         agricultural fields and associated structures such as irrigation                canals. Limited excavation will provide radiocarbon samples for                 absolute dating.  The relationship with habitation sites and                    monuments will also be noted.  In a second aspect of the project                MS Lepofsky will examine the relationship between agriculture and               environmental change to determine the extent to which                           agricultural practices are first responsible for, and secondly                  responsive to upland erosion which resulted from deforestation.                 With these data MS Lepofsky should be able to trace the                         development of prehistoric agriculture over time.                                                                                                               Oceanic anthropologists are extremely interested in the extreme                 variation in social complexity observed on different Polynesian                 islands.  In some cases large and complex chieftainships                        developed while in others groups remained relatively small and                  egalitarian.  This situation has provided an excellent test case                to examine the processes which underlay cultural development.                   The model most widely accepted today links development to                       environment and the nature of the agricultural system employed;                 it postulates that the development of intensive agricultural                    systems are necessary for advanced degrees of social complexity.                From this perspective the Society Islands are of particular                     interest because ethnographic data indicates considerable                       complexity but little agricultural intensification.  Ms                         Lepofsky's research will determine if, in fact, this is the case.                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons.  The Society                    Islands are not archaeologically well known and the results of                  this work will interest a large number of researchers.  It will                 shed light on the relationship between agricultural practice and                soil erosion in Pacific island settings and on the processes                    which underlay the development of complex societies.  It will                   also assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
