 "awd_abstract_narration": "Muscle contraction is driven by  conformational changes associated              with portions of myosin molecules when they are attached to actin               filaments.  This shape change results in a sliding motion between               these two muscle proteins and thus, shortening of the entire                    muscle.  Attempts to understand the dymamics of this system have                relied on two approaches:  (1) experiments that employ rapid                    mechanical transients applied to activated muscle and (2) mass                  action models that treat these proteins as independent chemical                 species.  Our research re-examines these two approaches with a                  combination of theoretical and experimental approaches.  From a                 theoretical standpoint, we will show that rapid mechanical                      perturbations applied to single muscle cell preparations                        lead to propagating waves of internal strain and that these waves               may account for the behaviors that have been incorrectly attributed             to mysosin kinetics.  Using recent experimental methods that employ             high - speed laser diffractometry, we show such waves occur and we              use such data to corroborate our theoretical predictions.  We will              also develop a new theoretical approach for modelling thedynamics               of interacting proteins.  In this new approach, we relax the                    assumption that each myosin molecule acts independently.  Instead,              we argue that the kinetics of each molecule can be represented as               an oscillator whose behavior depends on the kinetics of its                     neighboring myosins.  This system of coupled oscillators can yield              kinetics of an ensemble of molecules that is vastly different from              the kinetics of each individual.  These two approaches challenge                the classic views of muscle as a system of slow, independent                    molecules whose kinetics can be extracted from experiments                      employing rapid mechanical perturbations.//",
