 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Edward Green is studying the intricate electrophysiology               of a brain structure, the hippocampus,  which is known to be                    involved in learning and memory.  His work should provide                       important information regarding the nature of the information                   processing which takes place in the dentate gyrus, a special                    region of the hippocampus, during exploratory behavior.                         Furthermore, this work is designed to evaluate functional                       alterations in the hippocampus associated with behavioral                       exploration.  The proposed studies will utilize                                 electrophysiological recordings of field potentials and single                  unit responses of granule cells in the dentate gyrus of freely                  moving rats.  The specific goals of the work include: a) an                     evaluation of the interaction between the transient alterations                 in synaptic transmission related to behavioral state, and                       moderately persistent changes in synaptic efficacy that are                     associated with exploratory behavior; b) an assessment of the                   role of adrenal hormones in naturally occurring, synaptic                       efficacy changes in the dentate gyrus that accompany exploratory                behavior; c) a determination of whether the locus coeruleus is                  necessary for producing environmentally-modulated alterations in                granule cell excitability; d) an evaluation of whether naturally-               occurring alterations in synaptic efficacy and electrically -                   induced long-term potentiation share a common synaptic mechanism;               and e) a comparison of granule cell unit activity during specific               behaviors in the home environment to unit activity during the                   same behaviors following exploration.  Findings from these                      studies will provide us with detailed information about how a                   specific area of the brain processes information and retains that               information for the purpose of memory storage.",
