 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry will purchase seven novel mobile                    data acquisition chemistry workstations which will dramatically                 enhance all levels of undergraduate education in Chemistry at                   Clark University.  One such mobile chemistry workstation has                    been built and fully tested in two courses in 1989.  The                        workstation was found to be exceptionally useful in                             \"Introductory Chemistry\" and \"Instrumental Analysis\".  Each of                  the workstations comprises state-of-the-art computerized                        instructional equipment capable of sampling, storing, analyzing                 and sumulating data acquired at speeds ranging from pico                        seconds up to hundreds of seconds.  Early introduction and                      comprehensive incorporation of the workstations will expand the                 breadth and depth of the science major, and additionally                        motivate non-science majors towards an understanding of                         comtemporary science and technology.  The wide range of speeds,                 user friendliness, mobility, and the ability to interchange                     each of the workstations will allow utility in all of the                       undergraduate laboratories, and facilitate demonstrations and                   software presentation in lecture courses.  In the classroom,                    the workstations will demonstrate direct comparison of measured                 and predicted principles, as exemplified by dynamic comparison                  of simulated weak acid equilibria with direct ion selective                     electrode measurements.  The workstations encourage highly                      interactive experimental procedures.  In the laboratory, mobile                 units will be connected to a wide variety of equipment, ranging                 in complexity depending on the particular course or                             undergraduate research project.",
