 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this proposed research is to elucidate the             intermediate steps in the initiation of protein synthesis in                    eukaryotic cells.  The major objectives are to elucidate the                    mechanism of action of the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation              factors (eIF)-3, 4F, 4A, and 4B in the binding of mRNA to the                   ribosomes and to identify primary, secondary or tertiary structures             in the mRNA that affect the interaction of the mRNA with these                  factors and determine the efficiency with which the mRNA is                     translated.  The specific aims are:  1) to make specific changes                in the 5' ends of mRNAs and determine what effect(s) these changes              have on the amounts of eIF-3, 4F, 4A, and 4B required to initiate               translation; 2) to identify those structures in the mRNA that                   determine whether initiation of translation is dependent on a M7G               cap structure at the 5' end of the mRNA; 3) to identify the                     recognition and/or binding sites for eIF-3, 4F, 4A, and 4B on the               mRNA; 4) to determine when the initiation process eIF-4F, 4A, and               4B are released from the mRNA; 5) to identify the factors required              to initiate translation of uncapped mRNAs, such as poliovirus mRNA,             at an internal AUG initiation codon; and 6) to determine whether                eIF-4B or the cap binding subunits of eIF-4F or (iso)4F are                     phosphorylated and if so, what effect phosphorylation has on the                activities of these factors.  These studies will be carried out in              the wheat germ system with highly purified preparations of eIF-3,               4A, 4B, 4C, 4F and (iso)4F and with unmodified and modified form                of several mRNAs.  The mRNAs will be prepared by in vitro                       transcription of plasmids containing the cDNAs for .- and \u001a-globin              mRNA, satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) RNA, alfalfa mosaic               virus (AMV) RNA 4, barley .-amylase mRNA, poliovirus RNA (Lansing               strain, truncated), and Kozak hp7 CAT mRNA. Primer extension and                nuclease and/or chemical protection analysis will be used to                    identify the binding sites for eIF-4F, 4A and 4B or mRNA and                    antibodies will be used to determine when the factors are released              from the mRNA.  The results of this investigation will provide                  additional information will regard to intermediate steps in the                 initiation of protein synthesis in plants as well as other                      eukaryotic cells.  The results obtained will provide additional                 insights into the regulation of gene expression at the level of                 translation.",
