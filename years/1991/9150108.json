 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for a three year project to develop new forms                of assessments and teaching protocols for use by high school                    science teachers.  Explanation-based and procedural-based                       assessments that will be presented via video tapes are proposed.                Initially, the assessments will be based on teaching materials                  which are used to introduce topics of current interest in science               and technology into high school courses.  These materials,                      science teaching modules, have been developed by teams of                       university and industrial scientists working collaboratively with               high school teachers through the University/industry scientists                 Science Modules Program at Rutgers University.  This program will               extend materials selected from module topics to create innovative               assessments and teaching protocols.  These assessments will later               be broadened for general use by high school science teachers.                   This will be accomplished through the joint efforts of faculty                  and staff from Rutgers University and Educational Testing Service               (ETS) working with high school science teachers.  ETS researchers               have been leading a number of efforts involved in developing non-               traditional assessment models.  The ETS programs emphasize                      teacher collaboration in the development of assessment                          instruments and in the assessment of student performance.  The                  association of Rutgers and ETS researchers forms a collaboration                that draws upon the unique strengths of individuals from both                   institutions. *** //",
