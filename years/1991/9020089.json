 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the utility of using demonstrational                 techniques in user interfaces for computer programs.                            Demonstrational user interfaces provide concrete examples on                    which the user operates, rather than requiring the user to deal                 with abstractions such as variables and control structures.  In                 the demonstrational approach, the user provides examples and the                system infers how the examples would be generalized to create                   something that is more general purpose.  More successful                        approaches limit the inferences to a specific domain.  Two                      applications are chosen in this research.  One is text formatting               and the other is a visual shell to the UNIX operating system.  In               the second case, a macro system is created without using a                      programming language by a rule-based inference system.  The user                interacts with simple commands.  The system determines from the                 user's actions how to construct more complicated commands given                 also its knowledge about file and operating system details.  The                two applications are to be released to up to about 3000 subjects                providing evaluation of potential advantages and issues.  This                  research addresses issues relevant to broader programmatic goals                including making computer systems adapt to end users.",
