 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's             (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is               designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly             the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                 Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.               Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                   conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture             capital or other non-federal financing.                                              This is a Phase I project.  The results of this project could              very well become the basis for more effective commercial                        compression subsystems, critical to the successful use of imaging               in a computer environment.  The more efficient imaging systems                  would require less storage and transmission time and/or provide                 improved image quality.",
