 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to make available to                   undergraduate physics majors and other students the equipment                   necessary for fabricating material samples by means of                          sputtering technology.   The Department of Physics and                          Astronomy at CSUS is presently revising its program to include                  more emphasis on applied topics, especially in the areas of                     Solid State Physics and Optics.  The preparation of material                    samples and the subsequent characterization of their electrical                 and optical properties is an important basic skill in any such                  program.   Students are being introduced to the theory and                      practice of sputtering and then using the technology to                         fabricate and characterize samples with interesting electrical                  and optical properties in several upper-division courses.The                    physics department is in the final stages of modernizing and                    adding elective concentrations in the BA and BS degree                          programs.   These changes make the programs more closely match                  the career goals of present-day students and introduce subject                  matter into the curriculum of more relevance to the                             semiconductor and optics industries that are moving into the                    Sacramento area in ever greater numbers.  Eventually the                        department expects that this will attract more students to a                    physics major.   The purchase of this sputtering equipment                      makes it possible to offer students hands-on experience in a                    very important area of solid state physics and optics which is                  of particular importance to those pursuing an advanced degree                   or a job in experimental research or industrial work.NSF grant                  funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.",
