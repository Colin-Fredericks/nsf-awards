There is,                      however, concern that the analytical and sampling variability                   associated with the methods be sufficiently within control that                 the important temporal and spatial variability of particles and                 fluxes may be discerned.  At this time there is a considerable                  diversity of approaches and techniques being used by the                        community of active researchers in this field and there is no                   single source which provides a review and catalogue of existing                 methods for the characterization of marine particles.  In order                 to remedy this workshop on sampling and chemical analysis of                    marine particles will bring together leading researchers in the                 field of marine particle analysis.  The object of this meeting                  will be to produce a monograph which will be a comprehensive                    overview of the present practices, provide an effective teaching                resource for graduate level oceanography courses and be a                       reference for experienced researchers.",
