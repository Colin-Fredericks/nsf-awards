 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decisions by Third World farmers about which crops to raise                and how to produce them are related to the gender of the decision               makers.  Because women and men play markedly different roles,                   greater understanding about the incentives for increased                        productivity and distribution of proceeds must include                          exploration of the dynamices of gender-specific income generation               and household responsibility.  In the past two decades, women                   have established a major new cash-crop system centered on                       vegetable production has emerged in The Gambia.  The process has                entailed the inversion of the income-earning potentials of                      husbands and wives, the radical alteration of the farming system,               and the advent of a new sense of urgency in gender conflicts.                   Men have adopted different strategies to control the growing                    network of market gardens.  This doctoral dissertation project                  will focus on the ways in which women are defending themselves                  against these attempts to encroach on their new economic                        position.  Data will be collected from village and communal                     garden site censuses, garden surveys, individual interviews,                    income and land tenure surveys, and archival materials.  These                  data will be used to test four hypotheses related to climate                    change, seasonality, competing land use systems, and the dual                   nature of social and technical conflicts over gardening.                        Research will be focused on sites located primarily in the North                Bank community of Kerewan.                                                                                                                                           This project will provide an opportunity to analyze                        intrahousehold bargaining and negotiation under circumstances in                which women appear to have an economic upper hand.  It will make                an important contribution both to the understanding of gender                   conflict and to the social fabric of Third World agricultural                   development.  This project also will provide an excellent                       opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop                independent research skills.",
