 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition, setup, and incorporation of a computer-                        controlled viscometer system and a laboratory filter press system               into ceramic engineering curriculum is supported.  This equipment               represents a significant modernization of available                             instrumentation to support the teaching of ceramic processing of                fine particle systems.                                                                                                                                          Most ceramic manufacturing deals with the processing of powder                  raw materials.  The ability to control these processed depends                  upon the engineer's understanding of the governing cause-and-                   effect relationships.  Although such processes have been in use                 for many year, many details of these relationships are only just                becoming clear as computers and computer modelling techniques are               applied to these processing phenomena.                                                                                                                          The implementation of this equipment will allow the effects of                  particle size distribution and surface chemistry on the viscous                 properties of ceramic ware, to taught, graphically demonstrated,                and studied in depth.  These principles form the very basis for                 the successful processing of all ceramic -- traditional ceramics                such as porcelains, electronic ceramics including the new                       superconducting oxides, and structural ceramics.",
