 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bayesian approach to decision making under uncertainty                      prescribes that a decision maker have a unique prior probability                and a utility function such that decisions are made so as to                    maximize the expected utility.  This paradigm was justified by                  axiomatic treatments but challenged by several classes of evidence:             experimental results incompatible with the consistency condition                implied by the Bayesian approach, difficulties people have in                   specifying a prior probability, and economic phenomena                          contradictory to the theoretical results.                                                                                                                       Among many models suggested to generalize the Bayesian approach are             the nonadditive probabilities model and the multiple priors model.              These models have passed an important test: they have been                      axiomatized.  However, these one-shot decision models shed little               light on the problem of dynamically updating probabilities as new               information is gathered.  The natural question then is: what are                the reasonable ways for economic agents to update beliefs over                  time?                                                                                                                                                           This study will deal with this problem axiomatically and suggest                plausible updating rules which satisfy some basic requirements.                 A family of pseudo-Bayesian rules, each of which may be considered              a generalization of Bayes' rule for a unique additive prior, will               be presented and studied.  A family of classical updating rules,                each of which starts out with a given set of priors, possibly rules             some of them out in the face of new information, and continues with             the Bayesian updates of the remaining ones, will also be studied.                                                                                               The assumption of a unique given prior probability is clearly                   unrealistic.  New political circumstances, technological advances,              new firms, and new products are all counter-examples in which the               assumption of a unique prior is unreasonable.  Consequently, this               study will provide important theoretical foundation upon which we               build our understanding of the adjustment of economic agents to new             phenomena or new information.",
