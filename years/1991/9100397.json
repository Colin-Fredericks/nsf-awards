 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small populations of endangered species risk extinction due                to random changes in population size, or due to harmful genetic                 changes.  This research examines the relative importance of these               two factors for species survival.  The investigators will study                 this question using wild populations of two rare plants species                 in western Montana.  Results will contribute to general                         understanding of changes in population size, as well as allow                   managers to formulate guidelines and principles for preservation                of these and similar species.                                                        Finally, Lesquerella humilis, one of the species to be                     studied, is an alternative crop species with potential economic                 value in industry and medicine.  Unique hydroxylated oils from                  Lesquerella have several uses in manufacturing.  Sulfur compounds               (glucosinolates) from Lesquerella are being examined as a                       potential antitumor drug.  Thus, this research has important                    relevance to basic understanding of conservation biology as well                as potential for practical application.",
