 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project both mechanistic and synthetic aspects of                       alkene ozonolysis will be investigated. The mechanistic studies                 will focus on the determination of the stereochemistry of the                   elusive carbonyl oxide intermediate, making use of an                           intramolecular trapping protocol which will permit reliable                     assignment of syn-anti geometry to carbonyl oxides produced by                  alkene ozonolysis. The effect of various substituents in                        determining carbonyl oxide stereochemistry will also be                         studied, as will the influence of ring size in cycloalkenes.                    These studies will provide important information for refinement                 of theoretical models which account for the overall                             stereoselectivity of alkene ozonolysis. Another mechanistic                     study will investigate the role of dioxirane-like intermediates                 in ozonide decomposition through O-labelling experiments. In                    the synthetic area, the cationic ring expansion of certain                      ozonides to the 1,2,4-trioxane system will be investigated in                   terms of the scope of the reaction and its application to the                   synthesis of the antimalarial artemisinin.                                      %%%                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                  Division will support the research of Dr. William H. Bunnelle                   of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri -                  Columbia. Both mechanistic and synthetic aspects of reactions                   of hydrocarbons containing double bonds (alkenes) with ozone                    will be investigated.  Some of the proposed intermediates in                    the ozonolysis process may be significant with regard to the                    toxicity of fatty acid ozonides.",
