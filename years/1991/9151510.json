 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to incorporate state-of-the-art                     observing into all levels of the astronomy curriculum, from                     introductory courses to advanced senior research projects.  A                   strong foundation is already in place--an extensive curriculum,                 a modern planetarium, dedicated teachers, and a relatively                      large (0.5-meter), new telescope--and this project builds on                    it.  observing opportunities for students are being greatly                     expanded through the use of a CCD camera for the 0.5m                           telescope.  In introductory classes the project enables the                     capture of  student interest with images and observing projects                 possible only with the sensitivity and immediate output of the                  CCD.  The best projects and labs are those that invite students                 to make their own observations, and a CCD camera makes that                     possible.  Basic projects are made available to all students,                   and a new introductory lab section provides more extensive                      hands-on experience for the best students.For more advanced                     students a new lab course on modern CCD detectors and observing                 techniques is being created.  Hands-on experience is a                          necessary and vital part of this course.  For the most advanced                 and serious students among our physics majors and astronomy                     minors, independent study offers more extended access to the                    telescope, and the opportunity to gain additional observing                     experience and to pursue serious research.",
