 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will be a systematic biochemical                           characterization in vitro of the mechanism of transcription                     attenuation by human RNA polymerase II at a site within the                     adenovirus major late transcription unit.  This site has been shown             to promote transcriptional blockage at late but not early times                 during adenovirus infection.  Experimental conditions have been                 found with which efficient termination at this site can be observed             and studied in a soluble, cell-free protein extract.  A major goal              of this research is to identify the proteins that are involved in               termination or antitermination at this site and to characterize the             role of these proteins in the reaction mechanism.  This analysis                will be complemented and extended by a localization and dissection              of the DNA sequences that contribute to the elongation behavior of              the polymerase.  In addition, a number of functional properties of              the reaction will be examined to provide a better understanding of              the molecular mechanism of termination.  These properties include               the kinetics and extent of transcript release and the role of this              research relates to recent evidence from a number of different                  laboratories that transcription attenuation within genes is an                  important regulatory mechanism in differential gene expression in               eukaryotic cells.                                                                                                                                               The long-term goal of this research is to identify possible ways                attenuation of transcription by RNA polymerase II might be                      regulated in vivo so that future experiments can focus specifically             on defining these regulatory mechanisms.*** //",
