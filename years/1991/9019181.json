 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physicochemical parameters which guide antibody recognition                 of a protein antigen will be studied employing cytochrome c                     (cyt) as a model antigen.  Of particular interest is the basis                  for differences in the antibody repertoires responding to                       variant cyts.  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) will be elicited                    against several cyts that differ by as little as one amino acid                 in an antigenic region.  The epitopes recognized will be                        determined from antibody binding assays employing a number of                   cyt variants prepared by site-directed mutagenesis or obtained                  from natural sources.  The amino acid sequences of the heavy                    and light chains of the mAbs will be deduced from the                           nucleotide sequences of cDNA. mAbs binding similar epitopes                     will be compared in terms of primary structure and any                          differences that occur as a result of an amino acid change in                   an epitope will be determined.  The three-dimensional                           structures of mAbs showing such differences will be modeled                     using computer graphics as will their interaction with cyt to                   obtain insight into the chemistry of the interaction.  Some of                  these models will be tested by X-ray crystallography in a                       related study.  Preliminary data indicate relatively restricted                 antibody gene usage with distinct V region genes used in                        response to the two major antigenic regions of cyt.  An effect                  of epitope topography on complementary determining region                       length is also apparent.  These observations will be studied                    further to advance our understanding of antibody recognition                    of native protein antigens.  The results should serve as a                      model for protein-protein interactions, in general.",
