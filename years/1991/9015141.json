 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      David Ruppert of Cornell University and Dr. Peter Hall of the                   Australian National University. The problem of binary                           regression analysis is to relate an outcome Y to a predictor                    X. An example of such a problem is to relate diet and other                     personal factors (X) to predict the development of breast                       cancer (Y).  Usually such binary regression problems are                        modeled through a logistic regression relationship. The focus                   of this research is on cases when X has measurement error and                   a surrogate W is used as an estimate of X. Recently, mathe-                     maticians have studied the problem of logistic regression                       with measurement error in predictors, and have pointed out                      that ignoring the measurement error and performing an                           ordinary logistic regression of Y on W leads to inconsistent                    and seriously biased estimates of the parameters in these                       equations. One solution which has been proposed to the                          problem of measurement error is a semiparametric method,                        which relies on the original parametric logistic regression                     model combined with nonparametric regression techniques.                        Building on this proposed solution, the objective of this                       project is to work on several problems of general importance                    to statistics through combining classical parametric with the                   more modern nonparametric techniques. Theoretical problems                      involving estimation of nonparametric and parametric components                 will be investigated. Combination of parametric and nonpara-                    metric techniques to solve the problem of binary regression                     when the predictors are subject to measurement error will be                    studied. A third study area will concern combining data                         transformation and nonparametric regression.                                                                                                                    The project represents excellent collaboration between the                      U.S. mathematician, whose work, under National Science                          Foundation support, focuses on nonparametric regression                         analysis and the Australian group, who have published many of                   the seminal papers in this area. This is important fundamental                  work in advancing the use of nonparametric techniques in                        important problems of mathematical statistics.",
