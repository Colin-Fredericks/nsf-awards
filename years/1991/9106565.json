 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individual genes affecting growth in body weight and                       morphology will be identified in mice, mapped onto chromosomes,                 and their effects quantified.  Recent advances in both molecular                and quantitative genetics have made it possible for the first                   time to identify genetic variants with small, quantitative                      effects on morphological features.  Genetic variants of small                   effect are considered to be the most important variants to                      developmental and evolutionary change.  However, the chromosomal                position, pattern of effect, and molecular basis of variation in                such genes is virtually unknown.  Instead geneticists have had                  to rely on untested assumptions concerning these factors in                     developing their models.  It is now possible to directly evaluate               assumptions about the direct and pleiotropic (or correlated)                    effects of genes on morphological characters.                                        Specifically, individual genes with quantitative effects on                body weight, growth and on a series of morphological features                   which differ in their timing of growth will be discovered.  Based               on our previous work, we predict that there will be single genes                with either independent or opposite effects on early and late                   growth.  The existence of such genes places important constraints               on the evolutionary possibilities open to mammalian development.                These genes will be identified using an intercross experiment                   between the Large (LG/J) and Small (SM/J) inbred strains of mice                in which these strains will be crossed to produce a heterogeneous               offspring generation which will then be bred to produce a grand-                offspring generation in which genetic variants from the LG/J and                SM/J strains segregate independently.  Regression and interval                  mapping techniques will be used first to identify molecular                     markers linked to genes affecting growth and morphology and then                to map these genes among the markers and measure their                          quantitative effect on somatic growth and morphology.",
