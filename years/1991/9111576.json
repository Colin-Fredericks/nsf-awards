 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted on phase transitions in frustrated                   systems such as spin glasses.  In addition to studying a number of              aspects of the spin glass problem, application of spin glass ideas              to the issue of the existence of a vortex glass in a type II                    superconductor with disorder in a magnetic field will also be                   pursued.  This will determine whether high temperature                          superconductors have strictly zero resistance in a magnetic field.              Work on phase transitions in quantum systems will also be                       developed.  In particular, the universal conductance expected at                the zero temperature transition between insulating and                          superconducting phases in disordered thin films will be                         investigated.  Since analytic approaches have turned out to be very             complicated for the proposed problems, the emphasis will be on                  numerical simulations.                                                          %%%                                                                             Numerical techniques will be applied to study phase transitions in              a variety of systems in which quantum effects and disorder                      dominate.  Included will be studies of spin glasses, vortex glasses             in high temperature superconductors and the insulator-                          superconductor transition in disordered thin films at zero                      temperature.  All of these problems are of great current interest               in condensed matter and materials physics.",
