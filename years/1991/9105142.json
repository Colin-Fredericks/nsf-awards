 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad objective of this proposal is to elucidate the                        mechanisms which control the activation of stored maternal mRNAs                at fertilization in sea urchin eggs.  These RNAs are stored as                  translationally repressed messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes                 (mRNPs).  A change in intracellular Ca or pH levels or the                      activation of protein kinase C in some manner alters the                        structure of the egg mRNPs at fertilization, resulting in their                 translational activation.  The PI proposes to analyze in detail                 the factors that control the repression and derepression of                     stored maternal mRNPs.  mPNP proteins involved in translation                   repression will be identified by by comparing the protein                       patterns of purified inactive and active poly A (+) mRNPs.  In                  addition, mRNP binding proteins will be isolated from in vitro                  activated egg mRNPs.  Antibodies against these mRNP masking                     factors will be used to monitor changes in mRNP proteins upon                   mRNP activation at fertilization.  Protein kinase C activation or               intracellular calcium changes result in the unmasking of egg                    mRNPs.  These changes may activate a cascade of protein                         phosphorylation reactions.  The PI will examine the potential                   role of phosphorylation in the activation of egg mRNPs both in                  vivo and in a sea urchin in vitro translation system.",
