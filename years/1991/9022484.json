 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Janet Pierrehumbert will use a grant from the NSF Faculty                   Awards for Women Program to pursue her research at the critical                 interface between phonetics and phonology, between the physical                 properties of speech sounds and their abstract mental                           representations.  The immediate focus of her research will be on                the phonetics of words as they are produced in sentences, with                  special attention to the constraints on syllable adjacency and                  the interaction of sentence-level intonational contours with word               structure and phonetics.                                                                                                                                        Previous research (to which Dr. Pierrehumbert has made important                contributions) has given us a fairly firm understanding of the                  phonetic and phonological characteristics of syllables, and of                  sentence-level prosodic contours.  The word level is where these                two systems interact, and here we have only sketchy, tantalizing                evidence so far of the constraints and patterns which apply.  The               research plan is to determine those constraints empirically, and                then develop a theoretical model of the phonetics and phonology                 of word-formation in English.                                                                                                                                   The model promises to advance our understanding of the                          relationship between phonetics and phonology, one of the most                   fundamental issues in linguistic science.  It will also have                    potential applications in such technologies as speech recognition               and speech synthesis.                                                                                                                                           In addition to furthering Dr. Pierrehumbert's important research                program, this award will also enhance graduate education at her                 university, by enabling her to employ graduate students as                      research assistants on her project, and to purchase specialized                 equipment and software to keep her lab up to date with the newest               developments in technology.",
