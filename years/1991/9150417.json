 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to create a sophomore-level                         undergraduate course introducing students from a wide variety                   of backgrounds to the principles and results of linguistic                      semantics.  The heart of this course is a software \"workbook\"                   that presents the material in an interactive, graphic                           environment.  The course and workbook address various aspects                   of meaning, including its relation to word and sentence form                    (morphology & syntax), its relation to systems of mental                        representation (cognition), and the interaction between meaning                 and use.  The goals of the course are to reveal to students the                 complex internal system of internal rules and principles that                   underlie our abilities as native language speakers, to let them                 experience some of the intellectual excitement that comes with                  discovering such principles and struggling to formulate them in                 a precise way, and to encourage them to explore the computer as                 a model of how we, as human beings, think and understand.  The                  results of this work will be of significant value in                            introducing undergraduates to the principles of scientific                      reasoning, in reaching students not otherwise considering                       science majors or extensive science electives, and in helping                   to foster interest and interdisciplinary exploration in the                     cognitive sciences.",
