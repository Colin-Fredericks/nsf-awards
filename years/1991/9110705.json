 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to investigate the                             noise characteristics of a two-dimensional (2-D)                                electron gas in the presence of a strong electric                               field , i.e., when electrons are out of equilibrium                             with the lattice.  This topic is important because                              noise defines the sensitivity and reliability of                                semiconductor devices.  The miniaturization of                                  these devices will lead to an emphasis on 2-D as                                opposed to 3-D electron gas.  In the present work                               we will use the Boltzmann transport equation and                                the Monte Carlo method to simulate current                                      fluctuation (noise) in a 2-D electron gas.  By                                  calculating the time dependence of the current-                                 current correlation function it is possible to                                  determine the current fluctuation and its frequency                             dependence.  Noise is defined by scattering                                     processes.  We will study the contribution of                                   localized and interface phonons to the noise.                                   Special attention will be paid to scattering by the                             electric potential of background and remote ionized                             impurities.  Capture by these impurity states and                               subsequent release will be examined; we expect that                             these processes will make major (and often                                      overwhelming) contributions to noise in the high                                electric field region.  Emphasis will be placed on                              the optimization of low-noise configurations for 2-D                            structures.",
