 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feature based computer aided design systems are now                        becoming commercially available for mechanical design.  Features                are recurring stereotypical patterns with which knowledge related               to various aspects of the product is associated.  Feature modelers              make it easy to modify the geometry as associations between                     entities of the part are encoded in the feature definition.  Since              features are viewpoint dependent, it is necessary to map/transform              them from one viewpoint to another for concurrent engineering.                  However, feature mapping presents some difficult problems,                      particularly with modelers that do not restrict one to a limited                set of predefined features, and when there are interactions between             features that change their generic meaning.                                          This research develops techniques which will enable                        manufacturing application programs to understand design features                from a manufacturing viewpoint and automonously generate feasible               machining process sequences for undocumented features.  In effect,              the system will be a self learning system that will automatically               update its own knowledge about machining options for a feature it               has never seen before.  Techniques developed will include:                      constructive solid geometry tree reconstruction to localize                     interactions, intelligent representation of manufacturing features,             and a meta knowledge base for encoding capabilities of machining                processes from which feasible machining alternatives can be                     generated.",
