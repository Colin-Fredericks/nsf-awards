 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Peter Robertshaw                   will conduct an archaeological survey of the Bunyoro-Kitara                     region of Western Uganda. While the prehistory of the region is                 not well known, limited archaeological work has demonstrated the                presence of unexpectedly complex sites which include such                       features as massive earthworks. Excavations indicate the                        development of a \"state\" the roots of which can presently be                    traced back to the 13th century A.D. Ethnohistoric accounts                     indicate that such a large scale society with strong centralized                authority existed until recent times. The process by which this                 tropical African state developed however is not understood.                                                                                                     Dr. Robertshaw's exploratory research will lay the groundwork for               a longer term large scale project. His goal is to set the few                   known large sites into a broader regional context. To do this he                will survey approximately 30-40% of the region. Random sampling                 methods will be employed to analyze ceramics at each site located               so it can be placed in a chronological framework. Through the                   examination of site distributions in both time and space and                    through comparison of site sizes at a series of limited points in               time it should be possible to trace the process of state                        development.                                                                                                                                                    This project is important for several reasons. Archaeologists                   wish to understand the processes which underly the development of               social complexity and which lead to the emergence of large                      complex groups. While much work has been done in non-tropical                   regions of the world, because of practical constraints such as                  difficulty of access and dense vegetation relatively little is                  known about how states developed in tropical regions. Dr.                       Robertshaws' exploratory work should help remedy this defect. It                will also set the groundwork for larger scale work.",
