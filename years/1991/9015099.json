 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the transportation and per diem costs of six                U.S. participants in a U.S.-Australia Joint Workshop on Skeletal                Microchemical Marine Fish Analysis, to be held in Hobart (Tasmania),            Australia, March 2-6, 1992.  The meeting takes place under the                  auspices of the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program, and will            bring together researchers who are using the relatively new technique           of skeletal microanalysis to study marine fish populations.  This               approach, which involves x-ray spectrometric analysis of ossified               structures (e.g. otoliths) in fish, offers an opportunity for                   greater understanding of the migration patterns of some commercially            important fishes.  The basis of this promise is the observation that            trace element composition and isotope ratios in fish skeletal                   structures show differences depending on the environmental history              of the fishes, such as the particular river system or other area                where spawning occurred.  The co-organizers of the seminar are                  Professor Robert C. Francis, Director of the Fisheries Research                 Institute, University of Washington, and Dr. Ronald Thresher, of the            Australian CSIRO Division of Fisheries, Hobart, Tasmania.  Australian           participation is being supported by the Australian Department of                Industry, Technology, and Commerce.  There will also be a few                   attendees from other countries.                                                                                                                                 The extent of dispersal of fishes from their spawning areas, as a               result of passive movement of larvae and, later, the active migration           of fish juveniles and adults, determines the geographic size of                 marine populations.  Knowledge of the size, structure, and origins of           these populations is of importance to ecologists, fisheries                     biologists, and those responsible for management of coastal habitats.           Older procedures used to measure the movement of fishes, and thus the           spatial scale of fish populations, have given ambiguous results.  The           relatively new technique of skeletal microanalysis offers important             advantages, if it can be further de\u001aloped.  Australian scientists               are world leaders in this area, and most of the scientists using the            new methodology are either in the U.S. or Australia.  Different                 research groups are using different approaches, and difficulties                still remain in the interpretation of results.  The seminar will                permit some of the most active practitioners of skeletal microanalysis          to share their experimental details and results with their colleagues           and with other scientists more grounded in the physical basis of the            measurements.  This is expected to lead to a greater understanding              and utilization of the technique, and to a greater efficiency of                effort in exploiting it in the future.  The technology has potential            for application in the U.S. Global Change Research Program (GLOBEC),            an initiative to understand the marine animal population and                    ecosystem responses to global change.  Based on the seminar, a                  summary document on applications of microchemical techniques to                 analysis of marine populations will be prepared.",
