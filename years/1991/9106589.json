 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to examine, both                              experimentally and theoretically, the phenomenon of                             multilayered microstructuring or stratification in sub-micron                   thin liquid films produced by the use of surface active                         agents; further to explore its use as a probe for                               investigating long-range structural or interaction forces in                    colloidal dispersions.  A unique feature of this continuing                     study lies in the development of a surface force balance for                    films with fluid interfaces for investigating the influence of                  microstructures on thin film stability.  Using this new                         technique, both film thickness and capillary pressure are                       recorded simultaneously.  The surface force balance in                          conjunction with the differential interference microscopy will                  be used to study films with curvature such as those existing                    between approaching small droplets or bubbles associated with                   emulsion and foam systems.  Experiments using differential and                  common microinterferometic methods will be performed to obtain                  the contact angle and film tension and, thereby, the film                       interaction energy and the disjoining pressure attributable to                  the presence of micellar structure inside the film.  Systems                    to be investigated will include both spherical and non-                         spherical micelles, mixed micelles (such as in mixtures of                      anionic and nonionic micellar solutions) and differently                        charged colloidal particles such as silica and latexes.  This                   study will provide insights into the origin of structural                       disjoining pressure related to interfacial structuring in thin                  films which gives rise to an increased stability in colloidal                   dispersions.",
