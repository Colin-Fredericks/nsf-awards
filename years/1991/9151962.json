 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasma etching has become an invaluable tool in the fabrication                 of modern microelectronic integrated circuits, making possible                  the high packing density of electronic components that has                      become standard in modern circuitry.  Many colleges and                         universities offer laboratory courses designed to give                          undergraduate students \"hands-on\" experience with fabricating                   microelectronic components.  However, these courses ignore                      plasma etching in favor of the easier, but no longer                            industrially useful, wet-chemical etch methods, leaving the                     graduating engineer with limited knowledge and no practical                     experience in plasma processing of semiconductors. This project                 incorporates experimental work in the undergraduate                             microelectronics laboratory designed to give students a                         knowledge of basic plasma processing equipment, to teach                        students techniques for etching semiconductor materials, and to                 facilitate the students' understanding of fundamental plasma                    processes and diagnostic techniques.  Diagnostic tools suitable                 for use in an undergraduate laboratory allow the student to                     understand the processes taking place in the plasma, as well as                 to evaluate the results of plasma etching of materials.  Using                  this equipment, students perform a series of experiments                        learning the characteristics of rf plasma systems, perform some                 easy diagnostic studies, and evaluate the results of etching of                 various semiconductor materials. A relatively modest capital                    expenditure provides the student with an in-depth knowledge of                  plasma etching, and its implementation in the semiconductor                     industry.",
